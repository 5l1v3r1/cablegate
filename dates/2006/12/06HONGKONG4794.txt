REF: A) USDOC 02862 
 
1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided 
below is prohibited by Section 12C of the Export 
Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the 
Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC 
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control 
Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) and Commercial Assistant 
Sandy Lai conducted a post shipment verification (PSV) 
at S&T Industrial (Hong Kong) Company Limited (S&T), 
Tonic Industrial Center, 19 Lam Hing Street, 5th Floor, 
Hong Kong.  The items in question are 160,000 
integrated circuits valued at USD 33,600, classified 
under Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) 7A994 
and most likely controlled for anti-terrorism (AT) 
reasons. If properly classified, these items would most 
likely not require a license for export to Hong Kong 
and mainland China.  The exporter is TLSI Inc. of 
Huntington, New York (www.tlsi.com). 
 
¶3.  The ECO and commercial assistant visited S&T at the 
address referenced above on December 12, 2006 and met 
with Ms. Oi Ling Leung.  Ms. Leung provided background 
on S&G and its business, which involves the provision 
of a logistics services on behalf of its parent 
company, Skardin Industrial Corporation, of Taipei, 
Taiwan (Skardin Taiwan) and Skardin Taiwan's China 
operations (more information on Skardin at 
www.Skardin.com.tw). The offices of S&T are relatively 
modest in size (three small offices with a larger room 
dedicated to boxes of various shipments). Transactional 
documents provided by OEA indicate that the UK 
affiliate of Skardin Taiwan was the purchaser of the 
applicable items while shipment was made to S&T. 
 
¶4.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, S&T 
has been in existence since 2001 and the corporate 
registered address is the same as the address at which 
the check occurred.  Unlike many other companies the 
ECO has encountered, S&T has relatively significant 
paid in capital of HKD 4,000,000 (approximately USD 
520,000). 
 
¶5.  Ms. Leung stated that with respect to the shipment 
in question, S&T accepted the shipment of the 160,000 
integrated circuits and, in turn, forwarded those 
circuits among the various Skardin Taiwan production 
facilities in mainland China. Ms. Leung provided the 
ECO with the relevant shipping documents in respect of 
those shipments into the mainland.  Ms. Leung stated 
that the items are used in the production of 
residential satellite receivers for sale primarily in 
European Union countries (such satellite receivers are 
referenced in the Skardin website). 
 
¶6. At the time visited, S&T appeared to be a suitable 
recipient of the controlled items (as logistics 
provider) since it cooperated with the check and 
operates a business that is consistent with its role in 
the manufacturing process. Consistent with BIS guidance 
on the classification of checks where the ECO is unable 
to visually inspect the items, the ECO recommends that 
this PSV be classified as Limited.
