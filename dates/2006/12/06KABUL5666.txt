SUBJECT: PRT/QAL-E NOW: REBUILT AIRSTRIP IMPROVES LIVES 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The Spanish PRT recently upgraded the 
Qal-e Now airstrip to increase the Spanish Military's ability 
to support and supply the PRT during the upcoming winter 
months.  The project was conducted by the Spanish Agency for 
International Development (AECI), which trained local staff 
and provided construction equipment that will be donated to 
the Provincial Government.  In addition to increasing the 
accessibility to Badghis (one of the country's more remote 
provinces), the project has provided critical training and 
experience to local workers.  As locals  begin to see the 
successful execution of reconstruction projects, this will 
reinforce the idea there is a positive alternative to rule by 
warlords and the Taliban.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
New Airstrip Increases Access, Supports Relief Effort 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
¶2.  (SBU) On November 20, AECI finished upgrading the 
provincial capital's dirt airstrip to a concrete runway 
capable of year-round operation.  The airstrip is 25 meters 
wide by 2,000 meters long, and there are plans to add an 
additional five meters to the width at an unspecified later 
date.  The upgrade was completed in less than three months 
and it enables the Spanish Military to better supply and 
support the Qal-e Now PRT during the fast-approaching winter. 
 The PRT is already using the new runway to deliver flood 
relief supplies and it will use the newly-constructed storage 
sheds adjacent to the airstrip as the primary staging point 
for the flood relief effort. (Note: In mid-November, heavy 
rains in Murghab District resulted in flooding that affected 
at least 21 villages.  Several dozen people were killed, and 
over 4,000 people needed assistance with food and shelter. 
Blankets, tents, and several metric tons of food aid were 
shipped to the affected area.  End note.) 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
Donated Construction Equipment Give Locals Vital Tools 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
¶3. (SBU) The project utilized 17 pieces of heavy construction 
equipment, including several cement mixers, a grader, 
steamroller, vehicle-born crane, fuel truck and a mobile 
vehicle-repair shop.  All of this equipment is slated to be 
turned over to the provincial government in the near future. 
The PRT has already constructed a facility in Qal-e Now to 
house the construction equipment once the handover takes 
place.  AECI provided equipment maintenance and usage 
training as well as resources needed to make equipment 
repairs to local staff so they will be able to maintain the 
fleet of equipment in the future.   The provincial government 
will assume all payroll costs for local equipment repair and 
staff to perform maintenance in the near future.  AECI will 
continue to support the storage facility with spare parts. 
This support is intended to provide provincial leadership 
with the ability to undertake future development projects 
without AECI involvement. 
 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
PRT Trains and Employs Locals in Reconstruction 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶4. (SBU) In accordance with the PRT's policy to increase 
local work-force capacity, 90 percent of the 50 employees who 
worked on the airstrip upgrade were local hires.  Five 
Spanish contractors provided oversight and management to the 
locals, and AECI provided 15 days of training and orientation 
to the local workers prior to commencing work to familiarize 
them with the equipment and provide basic skills needed to 
complete the project successfully.  Local staff now know how 
to use the soon-to-be donated equipment and are prepared to 
undertake a wide-range of construction projects that would 
require their construction machinery.

COMMENT 
------- 
¶5.  (SBU) The runway has greatly improved the Spanish 
military's ability to support and supply Qal-e Now, but the 
long-term impacts of the project are more civilian than 
military.  As often noted by provincial leadership, the 
runway is a prominent symbol of foreign donor commitment to 
the province as well as a sign of the province's efforts to 
modernize and connect with the outside world.  Those involved 
in the current flood relief effort are already using the 
runway as the center for relief efforts, even as the 
construction workers clean up the area and add the finishing 
touches.  In the long run, perhaps the greatest impact of the 
airstrip will be the development of the province's capacity 
to conduct future projects.  The provincial government has 
the machinery needed to enable them to launch their own 
projects, and can use local workers who have the experience 
needed to operate that equipment.  The ability to conduct 
reconstruction projects is essential to expanding GOA's 
reach, especially to the more remote provinces.  It 
demonstrates viable progress to locals and improves their 
daily life.  As locals in these provinces begin to see the 
successful execution of reconstruction projects, this will 
reinforce the idea that the GOA offers a positive alternative 
to rule by warlords and the Taliban.  END COMMENT.
