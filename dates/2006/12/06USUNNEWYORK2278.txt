SUBJECT: FINAL UNGA PLENARY ACTION ON RESOLUTIONS OF THE 
SECOND COMMITTEE, DECEMBER 20, 2006 
 
REF: USUN 2246 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: The UN General Assembly took final action 
December 20 on all the resolutions of the Second Committee. 
As is customary, final action in the Plenary was virtually 
identical to that taken previously when the Second Committee 
adopted each resolution.  For the sake of brevity, this cable 
will highlight only those four resolutions on which votes 
took place.  On all other items, resolutions were adopted by 
consensus.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Votes on individual items were as follows: 
 
Agenda Item 40:  A/61/418 -- Draft resolution on "Permanent 
Sovereignty of the Palestinian People and the Arab Population 
in the Occupied Syrian Golan over their Natural Resources." 
Adopted 163-6(U.S.)-8, with 16 not voting. In addition to the 
U.S., others voting no were Australia, Israel, Marshall 
Islands, Micronesia, and Palau. 
 
Agenda Item 51(a):  A/61/420/Add.1 -- Draft resolution on 
"International Trade and Development."  Adopted 
129-1(U.S.)-53, with 9 not voting.  In addition to the U.S., 
Moldova initially voted no but afterward changed its vote to 
"Abstain" in keeping with its tendency to follow EU lines on 
such items. 
 
Agenda Item 53(a): A/60/422/Add.1 -- Draft resolution on "Oil 
Slick on Lebanese Shores."  Adopted 170-6(U.S.)-0, with 16 
not voting.  In addition to the U.S., others voting no were 
Australia, Canada, Israel, Marshall Islands, and Palau. 
 
Agenda Item 53(d): A/60/422/Add.4 -- Draft Resolution on 
"Protection of global climate for present and future 
generations of mankind."  Adopted 137(U.S.)-0-47, with 8 not 
voting.  Abstaining were mainly the EU countries and 
aspirants, along with Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. 
Japan, which voted in favor, delivered an explanation of vote 
once again reiterating its view that the Secretariat of the 
UN Framework Convention on Climate Change should end its 
reliance on UN Secretariat support in view of budgetary 
implications. 
 
¶3. (U) The President of the General Assembly also noted that 
the Second Committee Program of Work, adopted in this 
session, will be later amended to reflect the fact that the 
General Assembly had adopted a decision earlier in its 
session (A/61/L.46) that transfers action on resolutions 
pertaining to humanitarian and disaster relief assistance to 
the GA Plenary and away from the Second Committee, as from 
the GA's sixty-second session.
