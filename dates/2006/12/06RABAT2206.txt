SHELTER-IN-PLACE 
 
REF: STATE 177681 
 
 ¶1. (SBU) Mission Avian Influenza Working Group met on 
November 6 to review guidance in reftel and has worked since 
that date to prepare the guidance it recommended and 
disseminate it to Mission personnel.  An administrative 
notice was issued to publicize the most recent M/MED 
information on avian influenza, and health unit and 
management have reviewed local markets to ensure they can 
provide accurate guidance to staff and their families about 
how they can maintain sufficient food stocks to 
shelter-in-place for up to 12 weeks.  We note that in large 
measure these recommendations build on material disseminated 
postwide earlier this year, though at that time (late 
winter/early spring) recommended food supply was limited to 2 
weeks. 
 
¶2. (SBU) We have also disseminated new warden messages and 
information on post's public access website to the general 
American community in Morocco, to ensure that we avoid any 
hint of a double standard in the manner in which information 
is conveyed to the two groups. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Per reftel, the following is our current assessment 
of post's readiness to provide emergency water and to assist 
in providing emergency food supplies: 
 
-- Water: water in Rabat and Casablanca is potable, and 
bottled water is also readily available in local markets.  We 
have recommended that staff maintain a one to two week supply 
of bottled water, and also keep on hand a gallon of bleach, 
which would enable them to treat local water supplies for 
consumption should they become contaminated in the event of a 
pandemic.  For its part, Mission has stockpiled 25 gallons of 
bleach as a reserve. 
 
-- Food: canned foods are readily available in Moroccan 
supermarkets, and we have recommended that staff keep on hand 
an emergency supply meeting Department's recommendations. 
Embassy Cooperative Association maintains a medium-sized 
commissary that could be used to supplement these supplies in 
the event of an emergency. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post has also implemented other recommended steps, 
including provision of spare parts, review and confirmation 
of delegations of authority, etc., and cross-training of 
employees.  Mission's platform on the topic has been up and 
running since early this year.
