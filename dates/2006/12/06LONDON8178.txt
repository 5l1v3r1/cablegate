SUBJECT: UK AGREES TO EXTEND SOME TRAINERS AT JORDAN 
INTERNATIONAL POLICE CENTER 
 
REF: STATE 192858 
 
The UK will extend six police trainers and their deputy 
director through the end of February, according to Camar 
Knapton, desk officer for international police training in 
the office of the international secondment team at the FCO. 
Knapton said the UK was aware of the request before LabCouns 
delivered demarche and had already decided to comply, to the 
extent possible.  Several factors prevent the UK from 
extending all of their current trainers, who number about 20, 
down  from the 31 estimated in reftel, she said.  Police 
secondment rules limit tours to one year, and many had 
reached that limit.  Budgeting was another constraint.  No 
funds had been earmarked beyond December 31, and more money 
had to be found.  Finally, some trainers simply wanted to 
finish their assignments at the previously agreed date.  In 
the end, the UK contingent settled on the number of six 
trainers and one deputy as the limit of their resources. 
Knapton acknowledged that the number might not correspond to 
the training requirements of the Iraqis.
