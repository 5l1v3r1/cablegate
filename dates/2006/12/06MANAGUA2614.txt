SUBJECT: ASSISTANT SECRETARY SHANNON'S MEETING WITH MFA 
CALDERA 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli. Reasons 1.4 (B,D). 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary:  On November 28, Assistant Secretary Thomas 
Shannon discussed with Nicaraguan Foreign Minister Norman 
Caldera the outcome of Nicaragua's November national 
elections, predictions for the Ortega government and its 
regional implications, and Caldera's future plans.  While 
Caldera believes that Ortega's stance and tone thus far are 
encouraging, he doubts that the new president will hold this 
position for long, as the conflicting demands of maintaining 
sound economic policies will collide with the unrealistic 
social expectations generated during the campaign period - 
including lowering bus fares in Managua.  Caldera has 
encouraged Ortega's technical advisers to take a slow and 
steady approach, including maintaining the current Foreign 
Assistance Secretariat under the Foreign Ministry instead of 
starting from scratch.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (C) Before his lunch meeting with President Bolanos, 
Foreign Minister Caldera, and other senior presidential 
officials, A/S Shannon and Caldera briefly discussed the 
November 5 election outcome and predictions for the incoming 
Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) government, 
including how President-elect Daniel Ortega will handle 
foreign assistance inputs. Caldera remarked that Ortega's 
stance and tone thus far are encouraging and applauded our 
efforts to engage the President-elect.  Caldera, however, 
doubts Ortega will be able to maintain his calm, conciliatory 
position for long.  Soon the conflicting demands of 
maintaining sound economic policies will collide with the 
enormous, unrealistic social expectations generated during 
the FSLN campaign.  For example, the  Managua mayor's recent 
lowering of municipal bus fares is untenable as there is no 
budget to sustain the subsidy and it will create problems 
with the IMF.

¶3.  (C)  Caldera recounted his recent meeting with UNDP 
official Paul Oquist -- a former U.S. citizen who worked for 
the Sandinista regime in the 1980s and renounced his 
nationality in the 1980s to become a Nicaraguan citizen. 
According to Caldera, Oquist was impressed by the Bolanos' 
government's management of foreign aid via the Foreign 
Ministry-coordinated Foreign Assistance Secretariat, 
especially after Caldera explained that the Secretariat can 
distinguish the interests and funding capabilities of each 
donor and direct these interests towards the appropriate 
projects.  He had urged Oquist to maintain the current 
mechanism, as starting from scratch by establishing a 
separate Ministry of Planning and Cooperation would incur 
additional costs, confuse donors, and delay assistance 
inputs. 
 
BANANAS COMPLICATE CENTAM-EU TRADE TALKS

¶4.  (C) Confirming his plans to continue as Central America's 
lead negotiator/spokesperson in the region's free trade talks 
with the EU, Caldera noted that only the Costa Ricans had 
fussed about his role.  He predicted that negotiations would 
take 1 1/2 years or more, noting that bananas are a 
particularly contentious issue.  Caldera explained that while 
Nicaragua is not usually sympathetic to Costa Rica's trade 
positions, it must support Costa Rica on the banana issue 
because some 50,000 Nicaraguans labor in Costa Rica's banana 
industry.  For Caldera, Honduras' interest in participating 
in an Ecuadorian-sponsored case before the WTO alleging the 
EU's unfair treatment of banana exports from Latin America 
(in favor of former African colonies) was another detour.  He 
had recommended that the Hondurans stay out of the case and 
let Ecuador carry the water for the region. 
 
WHO'S COMING TO THE INAUGURATION?

¶5.  (C) Caldera mentioned that the FSLN hopes to attract 15 
heads of state to the January 10 presidential inauguration, 
including Chilean President Bachelet.  However, he believes 
Ortega will be lucky if six or seven show.  Certainly the 
other Central American presidents, except for Belize, will 
attend, and probably the Brazilian, Ecuadorian, and Bolivian 
presidents.  He reported that while the heir to the Spanish 
throne has confirmed, Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has 
not.
