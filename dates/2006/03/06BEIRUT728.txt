REF: STATE 37310 
 
¶1.  On March 9, DCM delivered reftel demarche to Dr.Muhammad 
Baasiri, head of the Lebanese Central Bank's Special 
Investigation Commission.  Baasiri will lead the Lebanese 
delegation to the Cairo plenary. 
 
¶2.  Baasiri, who recently completed his term as president of 
the MENA-FATF, was well-acquainted with the issues of 
charities and money laundaring.  He noted that the paper 
referred to in reftel, "Best Practices Concerning the 
Charities,' had been reviewed at the Paris FATF plenary in 
October 2005.  He said that the MENA-FATF had not yet invited 
regional industry comments on this paper, but hoped to do so 
in the near future. 
 
¶3.  Baasiri also described the upcoming March 22-23 private 
sector dialogue in Cairo as a good opportunity to raise 
Middle East and North African banking sector officials's 
awareness of money laundering and terrorist financing. He 
said that MENA-FATF countries would seek to follow up the 
Cairo program with programs on a national basis.  Baasiri 
will attend the March 22-23 conference, and will be available 
to engage USG officials at that time.
