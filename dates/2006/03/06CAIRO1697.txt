¶1.  (SBU) The U.S. Naval Medical Research Unit (NAMRU-3) in 
Cairo confirmed the first reported human case of H5 Influenza 
infection in Egypt in a 35-year-old woman from a village in 
the governorate of Qalyoubiya, Egypt's major center of 
poultry production.  The woman, Amal Mohamed Ismael, died 
March 17, two days after admission to Abassiya Pulmonary 
Hospital.  The GOE announced the death at a press conference 
the morning of March 18.  The GOE's official announcement can 
be found at http://birdflu.sis.gov.eg/html/flu010187.htm 
 
¶2.  (SBU) NAMRU-3 reports that Ismael had originally denied 
contact with chickens, but in fact the family had hidden 
poultry in the victim's bedroom, contrary to GOE regulations 
prohibiting household poultry.  Ismael slaughtered some 
chickens after others began dying.  She originally entered 
the Abassiya Fever Hospital's outpatient clinic for treatment 
for a urinary tract infection, and then complained of 
generalized aching. She was transferred to a different local 
governorate hospital, and later to the Abassiya Pulmonary 
Hospital because she had developed pneumonia.  Despite the 
GOE statement that the victim was treated with Tamiflu, Dr. 
Yehya Sultan, director of the Abassiya Fever Hospital, told 
NAMRU-3 Tamiflu was not administered. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) 
tests indicated the woman was positive for both influenza A 
and H5; NAMRU-3 confirmed this early on March 18.  Results 
from PCR testing to confirm N1 will take a few days. 
Ismael's other family members appear to be free of the virus.
