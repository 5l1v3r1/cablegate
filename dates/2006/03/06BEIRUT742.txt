¶1.  On March 10, the Capital Trust Group, a private equity 
firm headquartered in London with offices in New York, 
launched the EuroMena Fund at an official signing ceremony in 
Beirut.  Philippe de Fontaine Vive, the Vice President of the 
European Investment Bank (EIB), told the gathering that the 
EuroMena Fund was designed to provide "capital and private 
know-how" to companies that have already "demonstrated the 
ability to succeed."  According to Romen Mathieu, the 
Managing Director of the EuroMena Fund, EuroMena will invest 
in successful private companies that have been operating for 
three to five years and are seeking capital to expand 
operations.  The fund has a capital of USD 65 million of 
which 10 million euro (USD 12 million) is from the EIB and 
the remainder from partners and investors.  Mathieu told us 
that the Capital Trust Group aims to raise the fund's capital 
to USD 100-120 million soon.  The Capital Trust Group is the 
anchor investor and manager of the fund; other major 
investors include Al Rashed Group, Al Huda Investment Group, 
Al Jouaan Group, and the Bahatheq Group. 
 
¶2.  According to Mathieu, EuroMena investors would like to 
take advantage of the "tremendous hunger" in the region's 
stock exchanges for listed companies.  Fontaine said that the 
EIB had been involved in public sector projects dealing with 
wastewater, highways, and ports, but that private sector 
investment is "crucial" in order to "bring the needed surge 
of investment" to create stable economic growth.  EuroMena's 
target countries are Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, 
Morocco, Syria, Tunisia, and the Palestinian territories. 
The fund will not invest in real estate development, 
start-ups and turn-around companies.  Fontaine stated that 
EuroMena will focus on small and medium-sized enterprises in 
the manufacturing and service sectors.
