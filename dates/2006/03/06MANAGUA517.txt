(C) Foreign Minister Norman Caldera informed the Ambassador 
on March 7 that the GON understands USG concerns regarding 
Hamas and promised that the GON will consult with us should 
any Hamas visit to Nicaragua be proposed.  Caldera doubted 
that the GON would ever accept such a visit under the current 
Bolanos administration.
