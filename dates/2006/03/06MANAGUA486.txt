SUBJECT: NICARAGUAN TEDS REGULATOR RESIST PRESSURE FROM 
KOREAN SHRIMPING COMPANY 
 
REF: SECSTATE 30607 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Paul A. Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (C) During a February 22 meeting with ECONOFF, Director 
General Miguel Marenco of the Nicaraguan Fisheries Agency 
(ADPESCA) described a disturbing turn of events related to 
Nicaragua's turtle excluder device (TED) program.  According 
to Marenco's account, the Korean-owned shrimp company CONIC 
currently faces $40,000 in fines for violations of 
Nicaragua's TEDs law, but is vigorously fighting any attempt 
to collect the fees.  CONIC's efforts range from using the 
legal administrative appeals process, to a sending letter to 
the President of Nicaragua complaining that Marenco is 
violating his charge as a public servant, to allegedly 
offering Marenco a $10,000 bribe and threatening him with 
prosecution and even violence.  It is likely that the 
administrative appeals will be advanced from ADPESCA, which 
is a subunit of the Ministry of Trade (MIFIC), to the 
Minister of Trade, and eventually to the Nicaraguan Supreme 
Court (CSJ).  While ADPESCA is standing firm, Marenco is 
concerned about what could happen once the appeal leaves his 
control.  He has consequently requested a letter from the 
Ambassador to the Minister of Trade to emphasize the danger 
to Nicaragua's shrimp interests should the GON back down on 
enforcement of the TEDs law - - We are drafting such a note. 
 
¶2.  (C) While post has no reason to doubt the transparency of 
the MIFIC appeals process, Marenco seems genuinely concerned, 
and the Nicaraguan courts are known to be subject to improper 
influence.  Given the CSJ's susceptibility to improper 
influence in its decision making, it is not unforeseeable 
that the court could spare CONIC from having to pay its 
fines, which could in turn conceivably affect Nicaragua's 
ability to export shrimp to the US under Section 609 of P.L. 
101-162. 
 
¶3. (C) Post would appreciate any insights Embassy Seoul might 
have on the issue of this Korean firm evading a legitimate 
fine, and whether an approach to the Korean government might 
be in order.
