JUMBLATT AT THE TABLE 
 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Lebanon's national dialogue resumed the morning 
of March 13, with the main discussion on Lebanese-Syrian 
relations.  According to MP Boutros Harb, the atmosphere at 
the meeting was good.  He said, "The simple fact that we are 
going to meet again this afternoon is a positive 
development."  Harb said that the conferees agreed on the 
principle of establishing diplomatic relation through the 
creations of embassies in the two capitals.  Harb also said 
that the Lebanese-Syrian Higher Council would be dismantled. 
The attendees decided that the council had symbolized the 
era of Syrian hegemony over Lebanon.  In the mutual security 
discussions, Hassan Nasrallah raised an old slogan that the 
"security of Lebanon depends on the security of Syria and 
vice versa."  Harb objected to this formulation as outdated. 
He warned that Nasrallah's phrase could allow Syria to use 
it as a pretext in the future to compromise Lebanese 
security interests.  In the end, the body adopted the Taif 
agreement formulation, which stipulates that Lebanon, 
"should not allow itself to become a means of access or a 
base for any force, state, or organization seeking to 
undermine the security of Lebanon or Syria.  Syria, which 
seeks Lebanon's security, independence, unity and internal 
harmony among its citizens, should not permit any act that 
poses a threat to Lebanon's security, independence, and 
sovereignty." 
¶2.  (SBU)  MP Elie Skaff told us that things are moving 
along well in the talks.  He said that there was strong 
opposition from Jumblatt, Ja'ja' and Hariri to discuss 
possible relations with the Syrian regime.  However, Skaff 
added his own thought that because of geography, Lebanon 
must have good relations with Syria.  He also confirmed the 
agreement reached on the need to establish diplomatic 
relations with Syria.  Skaff said the controversial issue of 
the Shebaa farms has been postponed to the March 13 evening 
session.
