Classified By: Ambassador Paul Trivelli for reasons 1.4 (b and d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary: Preliminary results for the allocation of 
seats on the Councils of the South Atlantic Autonomous Region 
(RAAS) and North Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAN) indicate 
that the PLC will win enough positions to control the RAAS 
without having to form an alliance with another party.  In 
the RAAN, however, none of the parties will gain an outright 
majority.  FSLN officials claim they will control the RAAN 
Council with regional indigenous party Yatama, although the 
PLC has announced its intention to court Yatama as well. 
Disturbingly, Vice Foreign Minister Javier Williams Slate 
told the DCM that FSLN leader Daniel Ortega made a deal to 
assist narcotraffickers on the Atlantic Coast if they would 
help the FSLN win the elections.  End Summary. 
 
VOTE ALLOCATION SYSTEM FAVORS FSLN AND YATAMA

¶2. (U) As reported in reftel A, the multi-member district 
proportional representation system allocated a 
disproportionate number of seats to the FSLN and Yatama than 
the overall popular vote would indicate.  The following chart 
shows the final vote count and the distribution of Council 
seats by party. 
 
North Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAN): 
 
PARTY VOTE  PERCENTAGE  COUNCIL SEATS 
 
PLC   23,783      37.4%       16 
FSLN  19,212      30.2%       17 
Yatama      12,330      19.2%       12 
ALN-PC      3,414 5.4%        0 
MRS   1,441 2.3%        0 
PAMUC 1.316 2.1%        0 
APRE  1,268 2.0%        0

Although a few "impugnaciones" (official challenges from 
party poll watchers) remain outstanding, the CSE reported 
that they would not affect the final results.  CSE president 
Roberto Rivas announced that the Council would proclaim the 
winning candidates on March 14. 
 
PLC AND FSLN WILL FIGHT FOR YATAMA VOTES IN THE RAAN

¶3. (U) The PLC won enough seats in the RAAS to control the 
Regional Council without needing to form an alliance with the 
ALN-PC.  The FSLN proclaimed that they would lead the Council 
in the RAAN in alliance with Yatama, an indigenous party that 
promotes autonomy.  Diogenes Solorzano, the legal 
representative for Yatama, confirmed that his party signed an 
&alliance of governability8 with the FSLN that promises the 
governorship to Yatama.  PLC representatives indicated, 
however, that their party would also court Yatama in an 
attempt to control the RAAN Regional Council by also offering 
the RAAN governorship and possibly some positions in the RAAS. 
 
ORTEGA MAKES DEAL WITH NARCOTRAFFICKERS

¶4. (C) On March 10, Vice Foreign Minister and RAAN native 
Javier Williams Slate informed DCM that FSLN leader Daniel 
Ortega made a deal with local narcotraffickers, which would 
allow the traffickers free reign in the region in exchange 
for political and financial support.  According to Williams, 
a Regional Council member by the name of Dereta brokered an 
agreement whereby Ortega would use the FSLN's influence in 
 
the court system to free a couple of traffickers from jail. 
One is Jorge Webster Rojas (arrested on Corn Island last 
year) and the other is Marvin Funez (arrested in Sandy Bay). 
 
¶5. (C) Williams spent most of election week at his family's 
house in Puerto Cabezas, where he witnessed the alliance in 
action.  From his house on the beach, he could see the 
traffickers using their new SUVs and pickup trucks to 
transport FSLN voters and election workers around town. 
(Comment: This is not the first time we have heard reports of 
FSLN/narco cooperation -- see reftel B.  End Comment.) 
 
COMMENT: REST OF COUNTRY WILL "FORGET ATLANTIC COAST 
ELECTIONS IN TWO MONTHS"

¶6. (C) Normally a forgotten stepchild, the Atlantic Coast has 
received intense national attention for the last several 
weeks as all parties have sought to position themselves for 
the November national elections.  The PLC, FSLN, Yatama, and 
the ALN-PC have all spun the results positively, leaving only 
Herty Lewites (MRS candidate) to admit that the outcome was 
not what he had hoped for.  Liberal candidate Jose Antonio 
Alvarado, although he spent relatively little time and energy 
on the Coast, appeared to lose some steam as the party he is 
most closely associated with (APRE) performed very poorly. 
But do the Atlantic Coast elections really presage November 
results?  Most Nicaraguans agree that the Atlantic Coast -- 
given its isolation, ideological slant, small population, and 
ethnic differences -- is unique, and therefore, the choices 
of its population cannot be accurately extrapolated on a 
national level.  One high-level contact in the Presidency 
told poloff that, despite the current hype, Nicaraguans will 
"forget the Atlantic Coast elections in two months."
