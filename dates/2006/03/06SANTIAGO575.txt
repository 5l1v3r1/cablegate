SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - IRAQ 
 
On March 20, center-left "Diario Siete" (circ. 23,000) ran an 
editorial entitled, "The U.S. Failure in Iraq."  Quote: 
 
"On the three-year anniversary of the invasion in Iraq by the U.S. 
and its allies, thousands of protesters hit the streets in Rome, 
Tokyo, New York, Copenhagen, Sydney, Barcelona and other cities to 
express their rejection against the colonizing war and requesting 
the withdrawal of the occupying forces...  In this case it would be 
appropriate to say the cure was worse than the disease....  How many 
Iraqis have died due to the violence in these years?...  What was 
this all for?  To prevent (former Iraqi President Saddam) Hussein's 
regime from using 'weapons of mass destruction' he did not have.... 
Is it appropriate to talk in this case about crimes against 
humankind?  Undoubtedly, yes....  Will (U.S. President George) Bush 
have to respond before the international tribunal for everything 
that has happened in Iraq?  Of course, he should.  It is hard not to 
feel indignation when listening to him say we are commemorating 'the 
third anniversary of the beginning of the liberation in Iraq'.... 
In the U.S. there has been some talk of an impeachment....  On 
facts, the United States has already lost the war in Iraq.  Like in 
Vietnam, each day of delaying the withdrawal worsens its 
interests." 
 
On March 20, business and financial "Diario Financiero" (circ. 
20,000) ran a column by international pundit Libardo Buitrago 
entitled, "Three Years of War in Iraq." 
 
"The Bush Doctrine fulfilled the promise of defeating Saddam but has 
been unable to give momentum to the goal of building a democracy for 
the Iraqis' well-being.... Where are the billion dollars generated 
by the higher oil prices of the past three years?  The ordinary 
people (of Iraq) have not experienced a significant improvement from 
Saddam's disastrous government to that of the present authorities."
