¶1. On March 20, TVN's "Medianoche."  Quote: 
 
"President Bush has had to withstand an avalanche of 
criticism...from comments that he is a coward and thickheaded to 
surveys that associate him with the word incompetent...Bush has 
announced a possible retaliation against Iran if it moves forward 
with its nuclear plan and threats against Israel....  President 
Chavez' statements do not seem to bother Washington.  Once more they 
have opted to turn a deaf ear to words that might not be too far 
from accurate." 
 
¶2. Government-owned, financially autonomous TVN.  Quote: 
 
"Some times too much diplomacy is tiring, other times, it is truly 
missed....  It is one thing to criticize the politics of a leader 
and another to insult that person's intelligence.  Hugo Chavez 
called President Bush thickheaded (burro) and genocidal--among other 
things--which clearly does not help improve relations between 
Caracas and Washington."
