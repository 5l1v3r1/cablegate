discuss economics, justice and other issues of mutual 
concern.  The first meeting is planned later this year - 
probably in October.

Copenhagen Criteria and will continue to press for this.  EU 
financial issues also must be resolved.  MFA Turkish desk 
officer Mary-Honor Kloeg told poloff March 20 that the MFA 
expects accession to take another 10 years.

Undersecretary for European Affairs Ahmet Acet will visit The
