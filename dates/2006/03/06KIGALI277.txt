¶1. (SBU) On 21 March, poloff delivered demarche and talking 
points (ref A) to Augustin Rutikara, America's desk officer 
in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Rutikara was 
noncommittal when asked if the GOR would remain in Darfur if 
and when it becomes a UN mission. He acknowledged the 
questionable Sudanese logic in opposing a UN force when there 
are currently UN troops operating in the south. He agreed 
that the situation in Darfur was deteriorating and NATO 
forces would add value to the force if the request was made 
by the AU. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Rutikara had no comment upon receipt of the Third 
Additional Protocol talking points (ref B).
