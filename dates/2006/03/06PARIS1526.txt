SUBJECT: FRANCE AND THE THIRD MEETING OF THE 
CARTAGENA PROTOCOL ON BIOSAFETY 
 
REF: STATE 34706 
 
¶1.  In response to reftel, Paris AGR, ECON and 
ESTH officials transmitted the talking points to 
the French Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry 
of Ecology, the Fraud Control Office of the 
Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry, and the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
 
¶2.  Jean-Louis Maurer, French Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Directorate for Environment, Biosafety 
and Biotechnology will lead the French delegation. 
The French Ministry of Agriculture will be 
represented by Laure Souliac, Head of the Office 
on Food Regulation and Biotechnology, General 
Directorate for Food. 
 
¶3.  We understand that France thinks it is 
imperative that concrete implementation of the 
Cartagena Protocol be adopted at the third meeting 
of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (MOP-3), 
particularly given the lack of results at MOP2. 
The French have already contributed to the common 
EU position, which will be presented at MOP3 in 
their role in the "International Environment" 
group of the Council. 
 
¶4.  More specifically on Article 18.2 (a), which 
covers the documentation of Living Modified 
Organisms (LMOs) intended for food, feed or 
processing, the French position is in line with 
the adopted EU position.  The French delegation 
will endeavor to find a consensus on Article 18.2 
(a) without questioning the EU regulation.  Note: 
MOP-2 failed to adopt a decision which detailed 
how to identify LMOs for direct use in food or 
feed.
