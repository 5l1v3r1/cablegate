Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  On March 14, the Consultative Committee on Khartoum 
internally displaced persons (IDPs) met with Khartoum 
State authorities to discuss the status of IDP 
relocations in Khartoum.  The committee wished to gain 
assurances from Khartoum State authorities that agreed- 
upon procedures for relocating and rezoning IDP sites in 
the city would be respected.  In addition, the committee 
sought feedback on the proposed U.N. Habitat plan to 
engage Khartoum authorities on a joint replanning 
exercise.  The government responded positively and 
promised no relocations were planned for the time being. 
It was also noted that shortly the Sudan People's 
Liberation Movement (SPLM) was expected to assume posts 
in the government responsible for addressing relocations. 
Charge Hume toured El Fateh 2 and Fateh 3 relocation 
sites on March 18.  End summary.

Consultative Committee Convenes After Dormancy 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2.  On March 14, the Consultative Committee met with 
Khartoum State authorities to discuss the status of 
relocations of Khartoum-area IDPs.  This was the first 
meeting of the committee since July 2005.  Since that 
time, a working-level technical committee has been 
collaborating with Khartoum authorities on practical 
aspects of IDP relocation.  During a pre-meeting chaired 
by U.N. Resident Coordinator Manuel Aranda Da Silva, 
donors discussed points they wished to raise:  continued 
collaboration between donors and Khartoum State to cover 
areas affected by demolitions; acceptance of a road map, 
including following the Guiding Principles on Internal 
Displacement and other international conventions and 
laws; and the Governor's support and endorsement of the 
concept paper drafted by U.N. Habitat in collaboration 
with the technical committee and stakeholders. 
 
¶3.  The meeting with the Governor lasted 45 minutes and 
included the U.N. Resident Coordinator and key donors. 
The British Ambassador and the U.S. Deputy Chief of 
Mission also attended. 
 
¶4.  The Governor expressed appreciation for the good work 
and collaboration of the technical committee, which 
involves representatives from his government.  He 
indicated that no relocations of IDPs are planned in the 
near future; however, his office is receiving many people 
from squatter areas requesting rezoning. 
 
¶5.  According to the Governor, the new state cabinet was 
expected to be formed in the coming weeks and will 
include SPLM representatives.  The SPLM is likely to take 
on the Ministry of Planning and Public Utilities.  As 
such, the SPLM will assume responsibility for IDP-related 
issues, including relocations. 
 
¶6.  The Governor welcomed the U.N. Habitat concept paper. 
The joint program provides approximately USD 18 million 
over 5 years to work with state authorities in developing 
and implementing an urban development strategy for 
greater Khartoum, addressing issues of physical and socio- 
cultural urban space and food security. 
 
¶7.  The Governor also recommended that the Khartoum State 
Water Corporation be part of the planning process for any 
future projects addressing squatter areas.  The Khartoum 
State Water Corporation has a USD 40 million budget for 
water networks for Khartoum State in 2006.  He also 
announced the construction of 4 vocational training 
centers with a capacity of 1,000 students each. 
 
¶8.  On behalf of the international community, the 
Resident Coordinator expressed concern over some reports 
in the local media about Khartoum government intentions 
to demolish IDP areas, which would violate an agreement 
the Governor made.  The Governor cautioned the group not 
 
KHARTOUM 00000720  002 OF 002 
 
 
to believe any media reports and stated that media 
coverage had been unprofessional and political.  The 
Resident Coordinator also expressed the international 
community's desire for the government to incorporate 
donor-funded development programs into government 
development plans and not view the programs as stand- 
alone donor or U.N. activities. 
 
¶9.  In conclusion, the Governor said that his 
administration has done much to support the residents of 
the squatter areas and suggested a tour to some areas in 
the coming weeks.  The U.N. will follow up with the 
Governor's office to communicate on the dates of the tour 
visit. 
 
¶10.  On a related note, on March 18 Charge Hume toured El 
Fateh 2 and El Fateh 3 relocation sites north of Omdurman 
with staff from USAID, USAID partner CARE, and the U.N. 
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.  The 
population of the area continues to grow, spurred by 
government promises to squatters that they will receive a 
plot of land.  Water supplies have improved in recent 
months, with several towers supplying water that donkey 
carts sell throughout the area.  Nevertheless, the U.N. 
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and its partner the Office of 
Water and Environmental Sanitation (WES) continue to 
supply free water from bladders and tap stands in the 
area, as water is still too expensive for many in the 
squatter areas.  UNICEF and WES are also working on water 
and sanitation activities in collaboration with USAID 
partner Solidarites.  NGOs provide free health care and 
food-for-work activities in the area.  Evidence of 
government support for the population was lacking. 
Residents complained bitterly that they still had not 
received a plot of land on which to build, despite 
promises from the government.  Moreover, the relocation 
area is so far from the city that residents must pay 
nearly USD 3 - more than a daily wage for many - in round- 
trip transportation costs, making them more vulnerable 
than when they lived in the city.
