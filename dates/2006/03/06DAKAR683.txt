¶1.  According to radio reports from Bissau, the National 
Popular Assembly (ANP) approved the Government of Guinea- 
Bissau's policy program and budget for 2006 by a vote of 
53 to 36 with no abstentions.  There has not yet been a 
statement by the African Party for the Independence of 
Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde (PAIGC), which campaigned 
against the program. 
 
¶2.  Bissau is calm although Bissau-Guinean military are 
reportedly involved in efforts to flush Movement of 
Democratic Forces of the Casamance (MFDC) military leader 
Salif Sadio out of northern Guinea-Bissau, using artillery 
and possibly working in tandem with other MFDC military 
factions. 
 
¶3.  COMMENT: This vote should ensure the Government's 
survival for at least the remainder of 2006.  The vote 
also encourages the international financial institutions 
to proceed with planning assistance and holding a donors 
conference.  END COMMENT.
