¶1.  Summary: Indigenous coalition CONAIE has temporarily 
suspended protests, promising to regroup for a return to the 
streets in April.  The announcement followed protests March 
23 in the North Central Province of Imbabura that left 12 
with minor injuries and 22 arrested. The GOE has refused to 
negotiate with disgruntled groups until order is restored. 
End Summary. 
 
Indigenous To Leave Quito 
------------------------- 
 
¶2.  Following a day of increased violence between public 
authorities and protesters, CONAIE has announced that 
indigenous members in Quito will suspend protests and return 
to their home communities to prepare an "uprising." 
Indigenous leaders have said the suspension of protests will 
only last until March 31.  Macas said that on March 31, a 
national indigenous assembly would be held in Riobamba where 
the "uprising," most likely to begin in April, would be 
planned.  CONAIE leadership also announced on March 23 that 
they were not ready to dialogue with the Palacio government. 
Roads were reported to be open in all but Imbabura Province 
Friday.  In the morning, high school students blocked roads 
surrounding their school in Quito.  Protests on March 23 in 
Imbabura left 12 injured and led to the arrest of 22. 
 
GOE Wants Order Before Negotiating 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Presidential communication secretary Enrique Proano said 
the GOE would not negotiate with indigenous protesters until 
disruptions ceased.  Proano also told press that losses due 
to the strike were between 103 and 223 million dollars, 
according to a government study led by the Minister of Labor. 
 Proano also said the government would continue the state of 
emergency in the five provinces until the situation returned 
to normal. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶4.  CONAIE's temporarily withdrawal likely only represents a 
lull in the storm.  However, this break will also give GOE 
officials time to elaborate a response to indigenous.
