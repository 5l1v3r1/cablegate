¶1. (SBU) Summary. On 13 March, Ambassador met with Sylvie 
Zainabo Kayitesi, the Chairperson of the National Commission 
on Human Rights (NCHR), to present the 2005 Human Rights 
Report (HRR) and discuss the work of the NCHR.  Ambassador 
Arietti discussed the importance the USG places on the 
respect for human rights and the rule of law and emphasized 
his desire to use the 2005 HRR as a tool for dialogue with 
the government on human rights issues. Ms. Kayitesi expressed 
appreciation for the meeting and agreed that the USG and GOR 
should have a close and ongoing dialogue on human rights 
issues. She described the work of the Commission as two-fold: 
investigating reported human rights abuses and educating all 
Rwandans on human rights. Kayitesi acknowledged that the 
Commission does not have adequate resources to investigate 
all the cases reported but said that the process does work 
for cases that are investigated. End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Background. The NCHR was established by the GOR on 
31 December, 2002 to promote and protect human rights. It has 
seven commissioners who serve three-year terms and a staff of 
42 employees.  Kayitesi has been serving for three years as 
Chairperson of the Commission. In addition to conducting 
investigations and drafting an annual Human Rights Report, 
the NCHR conducts extensive training and sensitization 
programs directed at the Rwandan population and has a gacaca 
monitoring program. The NCHR receives its funding from the 
EU, UNICEF, UNDP and the Swiss and German governments. End 
background. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Kayitesi said that the Commission would be finished 
with its 2005 report by the end of April. The Commission 
receives complaints from citizens and has the authority to 
fully investigate all charges of human rights violations. 
Commission investigators interview the victims, the local 
authorities and serve as liaison with the Office of the 
Prosecutor General to communicate their findings and make 
recommendations.  In its annual reports submitted to 
Parliament and publicly debated, the NCHR publishes the 
details of its investigations, any actions taken as a result 
of the investigations, and its opinion and recommendation. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Kayitesi said that the NCHR has good relations with 
human rights NGOs and noted that the law requires such 
collaboration. She said that there would be a meeting with 
human rights organizations, including PROFEM and local NGO 
LIPRODHOR, to discuss coordination on 30 March. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Kayitesi noted that because of Rwanda's history an 
inherent aspect of the Commission's job is promoting 
reconciliation. She said that when Rwandans return, they see 
that the country has changed and stay, but unfortunately, 
many in the Diaspora still have the wrong impression of what 
is happening inside Rwanda. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment. The NCHR is criticized by some 
international NGOs and diplomats for lacking independence. 
While it is not publicly critical of GOR policies or senior 
government officials, it does conduct investigations into 
human rights abuses and publishes its findings, including 
criticisms by name of law enforcement and local government 
officials. End comment.
