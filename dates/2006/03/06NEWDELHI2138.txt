End Summary 
 
NOTICES ISSUED 
-------------- 
 
¶2.  The Government of India in November 2005 appointed 
Supreme Court Justice R.S. Pathak to investigate (with 
subpoena powers) the allegations contained in the Volcker 
Committee Report against then FM Natwar Singh and others. 
Natwar Singh quit his post on December 6, 2005 in the 
aftermath of the revelation of the scam.  Media reports on 
March 17 indicated that the Pathak Committee had served 
notices to Natwar Singh and 17 others to file affidavits 
regarding their knowledge of the alleged misdeeds.  Other 
prominent subjects of Pathak's subpoenas include Andaleeb 
Sehgal, director of Hamdaan Exports and family friend of 
Natwar Singh, Natwar Singh's son Jagat Singh, and former 
Ambassador to Croatia and Congress Party "fixer" Aniel 
Matherani.  The notices sought information on whether any of 
the individuals had knowledge of the contracts bearing 
numbers  M/9/54 (Natwar Singh) and M/10/57 (Congress Party). 
The committee has also issued legal notices to Jamil Zaidi, 
former Rajasthan youth Congress president, Asad Khan, former 
Union Minister Shiv Shankar and Minority Affairs Minister 
A.R. Antulay requesting information. 
 
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION 
---------------------- 
 
¶3.  Following establishment of the Pathak inquiry, the 
Enforcement Directorate (ED) began a parallel criminal 
investigation of Natwar Singh, Jagat Singh and Sehgal.  The 
ED has reportedly obtained documents from Jordan and Iraq in 
connection with the suspected involvement of Indian Members 
of Parliament in the scam.  The ED is trying to ascertain 
whether any violation had been committed under the Foreign 
Currency Exchange rules.  The ED is also questioning Aditya 
Khanna, a London-based businessman and cousin of Jagat Singh. 
 
¶4.  The ED reportedly interrogated Natwar Singh on February 
17 and 18 this year but he refused to answer the ED's 
specific queries related to his Iraq trip when the deal was 
allegedly struck.  The former Minister reportedly claimed 
partial amnesia owing to old age and told the investigators 
that he remembered nothing about the trip.  The ED has also 
reportedly sent Letters Rogatory (LRs) to courts in Jordan 
and London to request the banks concerned to part with 
documents related to the transactions of Aditya Khanna and 
Andaleeb Sehgal.  ED and Income Tax authorities have 
questioned Andaleeb Sehgal and other associates of Jagat 
Singh.   On March 25, the ED asked Aditya Khanna to produce 
the Foreign Inward Remittances Certificate (FIRC) related to 
suspect banking transactions.  Jagat Singh and Andaleeb 
Singh's father Suman have handed over their passports to the 
Enforcement Directorate as of February 16 as part of the 
ongoing investigation and questioning.
