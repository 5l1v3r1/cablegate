SUBJECT: A/S HILLEN VISIT TO PAKISTAN 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker, Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) Introduction:  On his March 15-18 visit to Pakistan, 
A/S John Hillen and PM/RSAT Tom Canahuate met with senior 
Government of Pakistan (GOP) officials, as well as Pakistan's 
top military leadership.  Describing his role in soliciting 
support for USG security assistance to Pakistan from the U.S. 
Congress, A/S Hillen urged Pakistan's defense leaders to come 
to a decision soonest on the desired configuration for its 
purchase of F-16s.  A/S Hillen described the process by which 
the Administration notifies Congress of the transfer of 
defense assets, and counseled the Pakistanis on steps they 
could take to facilitate Congressional approval of the F-16 
transfer.  Turning to the Global War on Terror (GWOT), A/S 
Hillen praised Pakistan's commitment to routing 
anti-Coalition militants and other extremists in the 
Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) along the 
Pak-Afghan border, and sought Pakistani perspectives on how 
the U.S. could best configure its security assistance to 
support Pakistan's security operations in the region.  Many 
Pakistani interlocutors raised questions regarding the 
expanding bilateral relationship between the U.S. and India, 
noting that it has led to much public speculation as to the 
value that Washington ascribes to the U.S.-Pakistan 
relationship.  A/S Hillen stated flatly that President Bush 
does not view our bilateral relations with India and with 
Pakistan as a zero sum game; he stressed that the 
Administration seeks a sustained, strategic relationship with 
Pakistan. End introduction. 
 
National Defense College (NDC) 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) At NDC Commandant LTG Raza Muhammed Khan and his 
staff briefed A/S Hillen on the institution's history, 
mission and organization.  In a broad discussion of security 
issues, LTG Raza raised a number of "irritants" in the 
Pakistani-Afghanistan relationship, citing difficulties in 
achieving effective security cooperation along the common 
border and Pakistan's vulnerability vis-a-vis India's 
"foreign hand," which he alleged is operating out of 
Afghanistan to destabilize Balochistan.  Raza voiced his 
concern at the expanding U.S.-Indian relationship, saying 
that new Delhi received "far more than it deserved" during 
President Bush's recent visit.  A/S Hillen assured LTG Raza 
that although India is an important global power with whom 
the U.S. has a broad and complex relationship, this does not 
detract from the sustained and enduring partnership that the 
U.S. and Pakistan have built over decades.  A/S Hillen and 
LTG Raza agreed that NDC will play a vital role as the U.S. 
and Pakistan strive for a partnership of strategic vision, 
not simply military hardware. 
 
Ministry of Defense (MoD) 
------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (C)  At the MoD, A/S Hillen was received by Minister of 
State Zahid Hamid and Additional Secretary RDML (ret.) A.H. 
Chaudhary.   Hamid thanked the U.S. for its assistance 
following the October 8 South Asian earthquake.  A/S Hillen 
turned the conversation to the value of the International 
Military Education and Training (IMET) program, which he 
would like to expand for Pakistan.  When Hillen asked for an 
assessment of Government of Pakistan's (GOP) current thinking 
on F-16 aircraft purchase,  Minister Hamid said that the GOP 
is definitely interested in purchasing new aircraft, as well 
as refurbishing its current fleet and perhaps acquiring 
airframes through third-country buy-backs.  (Note:  Hamid was 
not specific as to the number of new aircraft the GOP would 
seek.  End note.)  Hillen encouraged the MoD to forward its 
desired mix of F-16s to the USG as soon as possible, so that 
the administration can move forward with Congressional 
Notification on the transfer.  Minister Hamid was pleased to 
 
ISLAMABAD 00005123  002 OF 004 
 
 
hear A/S Hillen say that he is trying to increase USG 
financial support for Pakistani forces currently engaged in 
security operations in the Tribal Areas along the Afghan 
border.  Recognizing Pakistan's leading role in international 
peace-keeping operations, Hillen also encouraged the MoD to 
consider offering training to African militaries interested 
in enhancing their conflict prevention and stabilization 
capacities. 
 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (C) At the MFA, Chief of Protocol (and former Director 
General - Disarmament) Nazir Hussain briefed A/S Hillen on 
Pakistan's programs to enhance its non-proliferation regime. 
The Protocol Chief expressed gratitude to the U.S. for 
earthquake relief assistance, but also shared deep dismay 
that President Bush had resurrected the A.Q. Khan legacy by 
citing Pakistan's non-proliferation record as the reason the 
U.S. would not consider offering Islamabad a civil nuclear 
deal to parallel that with India.  "Your man cut Musharraf 
off at the knees" with that public comment, Hussain said, 
noting that his President has a tough time selling his close 
relationship with the U.S. to a deeply skeptical Pakistani 
public.  (Note:  Nazir Hussain's briefing on a special PM 
program will be reported septel.  End note).  Additional 
Secretary (Americas) Shahid Kamal told A/S Hillen that 
 
SIPDIS 
Pakistan is looking forward to moving forward after the 
successful visit by President Bush earlier in March.  The 
public now has high expectations for the bilateral 
relationship, which presents a challenge to both sides.  When 
Hillen asked for one area in which Pakistan could use U.S. 
assistance, Kamal quickly took the opportunity to name two: 
education and market access for textiles.  Additional 
Secretary for International Organizations Tariq Usman Haider 
 
SIPDIS 
asked to see A/S Hillen to discuss the Proliferation Security 
Initiative (PSI), asking whether the U.S. would be willing to 
discuss possible Pakistani PSI participation; A/S Hillen 
agreed to take the question back to his T-Bureau colleagues 
in Washington. 
 
Pakistan Air Force Head Quarters 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (C) At PAF HQ March 17, Air Vice Marshall (AVM) Khalid 
Chaudhry (Deputy Chief of Air Staff for Operations) and Air 
Commodore Jamshed listened carefully as A/S Hillen outlined 
concerns raised by some Members of Congress regarding the 
pending sale of F-16s to Pakistan.  AVM Chaudhry assured A/S 
Hillen that Pakistan is prepared to address all USG security 
concerns regarding the F-16s. Citing PAF's long history of 
cooperation with USAF, he was perplexed that some in the U.S. 
are still anxious about Pakistan's security protocols for the 
F-16s.  Chaudhry acknowledged that the Chinese JF-17 (another 
staple in the PAF fleet) is simply not comparable to the F-16 
in terms of quality, particularly its avionics and weapons 
systems. Chaudhry then contrasted PAF's F-16 fleet to the 
array of fighters possessed by the Indian Air Force (IAF), 
supported  by strong defense acquisition relationships with 
the U.S. and Israel.  "The math just doesn't add up," 
Chaudhry said, admitting that the PAF has no hope of matching 
the IAF's resources.  Even the proposed F-16 purchase will 
not make that much difference in the relative imbalance of 
power, although it will enable Pakistan to maintain a minimum 
deterrent capability.  The F-16s have acquired a mythic 
quality in Pakistan, AVM Chaudhry admitted, taking on an 
inflated symbolic importance in the public imagination.  He 
concluded by asking A/S Hillen to ensure that the F-16 deal 
has enough sweeteners to appeal to the public -- a complete 
squadron of new F-16s, with JDAM and night-vision capability 
-- but not to offer the PAF things that it cannot afford. 
 
¶6. (C)  Warming to his subject, Chaudhry told the delegation 
 
ISLAMABAD 00005123  003 OF 004 
 
 
that Pakistan would certainly establish adequate security 
protocols for the F-16s, but that at the end of the day, the 
U.S. simply needs to trust its partner.  He cautioned that 
the U.S. should not "mock" Pakistan by offering "bone-yard" 
F-16s as part of the sale, saying that offering to transfer 
mothballed aircraft only plays into the hand of President 
Musharraf's extremist enemies, who already find a ready 
audience amongst Pakistan's uneducated masses.  In contrast, 
Chaudhry said, the Chinese "understand the Pakistani psyche" 
and therefore "they offer us everything," always on 
advantageous financial terms. 
 
¶7. (S)  Given all that Pakistan has done for the U.S., 
Chaudhry said, Pakistan's military leaders have a difficult 
time maintaining positive attitudes toward the U.S. amongst 
enlisted personnel.  He cited the suseptibility of the 
enlisted ranks -- most of whom come from rural villages -- to 
the influence of extremist Islamic clerics:  "You can't 
imagine what a hard time we have trying to get to trim their 
beards."  (Note: This last comment refers to the tradition of 
conservative Muslims to grow full beards as a sign of piety. 
End note.)  Chaudhry claimed to receive reports monthly of 
acts of petty sabotage, which he interpreted as an effort by 
Islamists amongst the enlisted ranks to prevent PAF aircraft 
from being deployed in support of security operations in the 
Federally Administrated Tribal Areas (FATA) along the Afghan 
border.  (Note:  Speaking off the record, Chaudhry told A/S 
Hillen that PAF aircraft are regularly called to provide air 
support to military and security forces when they get into 
tight spots in the FATA...dryily adding that Army brass and 
the ground forces commanders would deny it.  End note.) 
 
Vice Chief of Army Staff (VCOAS) 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶8.  (C) VCOAS GEN Ahdan Saleem Hyat greeted A/S Hillen with 
thanks for American generosity and steadfast support 
following the October 8 earthquake, fondly describing how 
U.S. Chinook helicopters became a symbol of the relief 
effort.  He offered his condolences on the deaths of two 
Embassy Karachi employees in a March 2 suicide bombing, 
before turning to Pak-Afghan relations. Praising the 
Tripartite Commission, GEN Ahsan opined that increased 
mil-mil interaction and cooperation -- including exchanges 
and intelligence-sharing -- would squelch the unhelpful 
public bickering widely reported in the media in recent 
weeks. GEN Ahsan renewed a proposal first presented to GEN 
Abizaid and LTG Eikenberry on March 6 to incorporate Afghan 
National Army (ANA) troops into a joint Pak-U.S. 
counter-terrorism (CT) exercise scheduled for May 2006.  GEN 
Ahsan said that Pakistan must succeed in its current CT 
operations in the FATA along the Aghan border for its own 
sake.  Grateful for U.S. assistance thus far, GEN Ahsan said 
that future assistance must be more sharply focused, 
particularly citing Pakistan's need for top-of-the-line air 
assault assets equipped with night-vision capability.  Ahsan 
gave special emphasis to the need to minimize collateral 
damage in the FATA, in order not to alienate the local 
population whose cooperation was critical to identifying and 
dislodging militant forces seeking refuge in the area.  A/S 
Hillen responded that the U.S. fully understood the benefits 
of night operations in support of a counter-insurgency 
campaign.  He also praised GEN Ahsan's description of the 
GOP's integrated strategy to extend government control to the 
FATA, securing military gains with development assistance and 
political engagement. 
 
 
Field Trip to Shahbaz and Mushaf Air Bases 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶9.  (C)  On March 16, A/S Hillen led a U.S. delegation to the 
Shahbaz Air Base near Jacobabad, Sindh Province, for 
 
ISLAMABAD 00005123  004 OF 004 
 
 
briefings on the Falcon Talon F-16 joint USAF-PAF exercise. 
After an initial greeting and briefing by Base Commander Air 
Commodore Athar Bukhari, A/S Hillen and delegation toured the 
airbase and visited with USAF F-16 ground crew and support 
staff. The Falcon Talon exercise is the first unified 
USAF/PAF exercise on Pakistani soil.  The exercises covered 
daytime air combat intercepts and unified strike missions. 
Non-flying exercise objectives covered EOD, flight safety and 
quality assurance.  On March 17, A/S Hillen and delegation 
traveled to Mushaf Air Base in Sargodha, which has been the 
home of Pakistan's F-16 fleet since 1983.  The delegation 
received a thorough briefing of security and maintenance 
procedures at the base before touring key facilities. 
 
¶10. (U)  This cable has been cleared by A/S Hillen.
