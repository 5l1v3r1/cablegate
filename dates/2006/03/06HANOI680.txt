(SBU) At a lunch meeting March 21 (Ref A), the Ambassador 
asked Vice Foreign Minister Le Van Bang what Vietnam plans 
to do regarding Venezuela's bid for a UN Security Council 
seat.  VFM Bang replied that there has been no decision yet 
on that subject, and that Vietnam wants to avoid a situation 
like the one it found itself in when its promises to support 
Japan's UNSC bid conflicted with China's request that 
Vietnam vote against UNSC expansion.  The Ambassador noted 
that it is in Vietnam's interest as a potential non- 
permanent member of the UNSC to have the strongest possible 
UNSC, which is a reason to vote for Guatemala.  He also 
reminded Bang that this question is viewed very seriously in 
Washington.  VFM Bang confirmed that the GVN received a note 
from Guatemala asking for Vietnam's support, but refused to 
be drawn out any further.
