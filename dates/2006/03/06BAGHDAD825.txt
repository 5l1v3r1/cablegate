¶1.  From the $2 million recently allocated by the Department 
(reftel), we have hired two Iraqi media companies to produce 
television spots (one per company) on fuel-subsidy reform. 
These spots will briefly explain the reasoning behind the 
December price increases and tie higher fuel prices to 
increased public services - i.e. better classrooms, 
additional hospital beds, more accessible public 
transportation.  (Note:  Results of recent International 
Republican Institute (IRI) focus groups -- conducted in 
Baghdad, Mosul, and Kut -- show that Iraqis will be most 
supportive of fuel price increases if they see immediate 
improvements in other essential public services.) 
 
¶2.  The television messages are expected to be complete by 
March 22.  After the joint USG-GOI Public Education Working 
Group approves the spots, our tentative plan is to start 
airing them throughout Iraq by the end of March.  We are 
working with Iraqi networks to arrange airtime for the 
messages, and we are trying to obtain reduced airtime rates 
by having the GOI negotiate with the networks.
