DISCUSSION OF CASAMANCE WITH SENEGALESE DELEGATION 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶1. (U) Amidst reported clashes between the Bissau-Guinean 
military and Casamance MFDC rebels (reftel), a Senegalese 
delegation visited The Gambia March 17 and met with President 
Yayha Jammeh to discuss the Casamance situation.  The 
delegation was headed by Pierre Kujabi, identified as an 
architect/businessman and head of the "Collectif de Cadres de 
Casamance."  In media remarks following the meeting with 
Jammeh, Kujabi said he had conveyed to Jammeh the following 
message from Senegalese President Wade: "the people and 
government of Senegal rely on President Jammeh's wisdom and 
knowledge of the Casamance problem to help solve the problem 
for once and for all." Kujabi went on to speak of a possible 
future meeting between the GOS and MFDC in Banjul. 
 
¶2. (U) Jammeh, for his part, reportedly assured the visitors 
of his "desire to end the conflict in the Casamance so that 
the people of the Casamance can perpetually live in peace and 
harmony." 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Senegalese delegation's visit is consistent with 
the warming trend in Senegalese/Gambian relations following 
their August/October dispute over transport and trade issues 
(Septel reports GOTG's announcement of increased Gambia River 
ferry tariffs heavily used by Senegalese transporters.) Per 
ref b, Senegalese Ambassador Ndiougha Ndiaye recently 
asserted to us that the two sides had overcome past strains 
related to Casamance stemming, in particular, from GOS 
allegations of GOTG support for the rebels.  According to 
Ndiaye, Dakar was now satisfied with Banjul's assurances that 
it would not meddle on rebels' behalf. From our vantage point 
The Senegalese delegation's visit and mention of a possible 
GOS/MFDC meeting in Banjul underscore the extent of current 
GOS/GOTG harmony on the Casamance dossier. END COMMENT.
