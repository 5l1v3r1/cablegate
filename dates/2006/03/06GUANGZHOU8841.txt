¶1. (U) Summary.  Hainan Airlines expressed little interest 
in the upcoming April 19-20 U.S.-China aviation talks, 
citing its inability to operate flights to the United States 
at this point.  This inability stems from three reasons: the 
airline is not a designated carrier; it does not have the 
necessary long-range aircraft; and it is still conducting 
market research on the American market.  Still, the airline 
is interested in the possibility of future flights to the 
United States.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On March 24, Consulate and Embassy officers called 
on Hainan Airlines (HNA) at its Haikou headquarters, to 
gather the company's views on the upcoming U.S.-China 
aviation services talks, to be held in Beijing on April 19- 
20 (REF A).  HNA officials said that, although the airline 
is interested in eventually flying to the United States, at 
present, "conditions do not permit [HNA]" to do so.  For 
this reason, the airline will "just take" the results of the 
negotiations. 
 
¶3. (U) HNA cited three reasons for their inability to 
operate flights to the United States at this point:  (1) HNA 
is not a designated carrier to the United States under the 
terms of prior U.S.-China agreements; (2) HNA only has two 
long-range aircraft on its fleet (two 767-300s, which in any 
case do not have the necessary range to fly nonstop from 
China to America; and (3) The airline is still conducting 
market analysis to determine which American markets would be 
most promising. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Explaining to HNA that we understood these 
limitations, we noted that the lifting of one of them, i.e., 
the fact that HNA is not a designated carrier, might be 
affected by the upcoming negotiations.    Moreover, HNA is 
part of a group of six Chinese state-owned airlines that in 
January agreed to buy 60 Boeing 787s, which means HNA could 
have the requisite aircraft in its fleet to fly to America 
by as early as 2008.  Therefore, we posited, the upcoming 
talks were of more than passing importance to HNA.  In 
response, however, we received a reiteration of the three 
reasons previously stated.  (Note:  China already has 
available designations that it could award to HNA, but its 
aviation authorities have chosen not to do so.  Nonetheless, 
if more designations are made available to China after the 
April talks, the airline's odds of becoming a designated 
carrier would presumably improve.  HNA would still have to 
overcome its own operational deficiencies before it could 
begin flights to the United States.  End note) 
 
¶5. (SBU) Despite the current limitations, HNA is clearly 
interested in at least exploring the possibility of flying 
to the United States in the future.  As one of its 
representatives stated, "all [Chinese] airlines know [the 
American market] is profitable."  (Note:  This conflicts 
somewhat with an assertion made in November by a China 
Southern Airlines (CSA) representative, to the effect that 
Chinese airlines are hesitant to enter the American market 
because they feel unable to compete against the local 
carriers.  In fact, its Guangzhou-Los Angeles route is a 
money-loser for them, although that might have to do less 
with the market than with CSA's own operational constraints 
(see REF B).  End note) 
 
It's different on the cargo front 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) HNA confirmed that Yangtze River Express, HNA 
Group's all-cargo airline, had been in talks with the 
Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport) regarding the 
possibility of starting flights between China and Boston. 
The airline's base is in Shanghai, and presumably the 
flights to Boston would be from there as well. 
 
Comment: We'll get there when we get there 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶7. (SBU) HNA officials conveyed a sense of apathy regarding 
the upcoming talks, which in turn probably belies the 
airline's perceived impotence to influence the process. 
This, of course, does not mean that HNA is not interested in 
 
GUANGZHOU 00008841  002 OF 002 
 
 
flying to the United States, as their comments indicate. 
However, knowing full well that its designation will occur 
only when and if Beijing deems it appropriate, the airline 
is probably adopting a "wait and see" attitude.
