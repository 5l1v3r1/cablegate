--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) During the March 8 protest (Ref A), protesters 
rallied against UN intervention in Sudan, delivering a 
letter to the UNDP office.  On March 7 (Ref B), a handout 
from protesters claiming to represent the Muslim Brothers 
student sector of Nilein University cited a number of 
anti-Islam concerns, and stated that the group rejects 
"American demands that call for foreign intervention that 
will take us back to the era of darkness and humiliation" 
(unofficial Embassy translation).  Demonstrators 
reportedly also called on UN Special Representative Jan 
Pronk to leave Sudan.

¶4. (U) Pro-government Sudan Vision stated that Vice 
President Ali Osman Mohamed Taha had departed for 
Brussels for EU meetings in order to "explain Sudan's 
view on the rejection of deployment of UN forces in 
Darfur or replacement of the AU forces stationed in the 
region by the UN."

Council of States Debates Issue 
------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) In an extraordinary session held on the evening 
of March 6, the Council of States, a national legislative 
body composed of two members from each of Sudan's 25 
states, met explicitly to discuss international 
intervention in Darfur.  Also no proclamation ensued, and 
12 SPLM members argued in favor of UN intervention, the 
majority appeared to favor rejection of UN re-hatting.

People's Commission for Defense of Faith/Homeland Warns 
--------------------------------------------- ---------- 
 
¶6. (U) At a press forum at the Sudan News Agency on March 
6, the People's Commission for the Defense of Faith and 
Homeland warned that any international forces in Darfur 
would "face a fierce resistance by all categories of the 
Sudanese people."  The Commission also warned the African 
Union peace and Security Council not to transition its 
forces in Darfur to international peacekeepers. 
Commission Chairman Hussein Suleiman Abu-Salih stated 
that the Sudanese people rejected UNSC Resolutions 1590, 
1591, and 1593, which he said were unjust and posed an 
attempt to "undermine Sudan's sovereignty."  Chair of the 
Sudanese Women's Union Raja Hassan Khalifa warned of the 
repeat of "the same atrocities which happened in Iraq," 
and called on the negotiating parties in Abuja to "speed 
up the process to reach a quick peace agreement, which 
will prevent Sudan and Darfur from intervention of 
international forces."

Acting FM Receives UNSP Pronk

¶7. (U) According to the Sudan News Agency, Acting 
Minister for Foreign Affairs Ali Karti met on March 6 
 
KHARTOUM 00000606  002 OF 002 
 
 
with UN Special Representative Jan Pronk.  Karti stated 
that the efforts being exerted by "foreign powers" were 
having a "negative impact on the peace process in 
Darfur," and sent "negative signals to the Darfur rebel 
movements, pushing them to adopt yet more intransigent 
stands during the peace talks."  Pronk maintained that 
the UN seeks peace in Darfur, and is independent.  He 
noted that efforts should concentrate on supporting the 
peace negotiations and halting security violations in 
Darfur.

Darfurian Opinions Aired 
------------------------ 
 
¶8. (U) The Pro-government Sudan Vision also published an 
article, "International Forces in Darfur:  A Blessing or 
a Curse?," which cited a series of individuals as stating 
international intervention in Darfur would involve: "open 
interference in our internal affairs," "a breach of 
national sovereignty," a "threat against national 
security," "some hidden agenda," "an American plan to 
impose hegemony," a plan to allow "access to Sudan's 
wealth and resources," and "a threat to the "country's 
unity" and its "social fabric."
