SUBJECT: OTTAWA DEMARCHE RESPONSE: COLLECTIVE REQUEST FOR 
ONLINE GAME SERVICES IN WTO 
 
REF: SECSTATE 36507 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Post presented the demarche and talking points to 
Joanne Hamilton, Deputy Director of Services Trade Policy 
Division, International Trade Canada.  Ms. Hamilton indicated 
that she is in touch with U.S. counterparts in DC on this 
issue, and she added that Canadian industry groups have also 
raised the issue with her office and in Geneva. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Ms. Hamilton explained that although the GOC is 
interested in investigating the possibility of including 
online game services in WTO, the Canadian consultative 
process is too lengthy to allow the GOC to cosponsor this 
request at the next GATS cluster beginning March 27.
