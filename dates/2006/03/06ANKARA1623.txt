SUBJECT: CODEL WARNER MEETS WITH TURKISH PARLIAMENTARIANS 
 
 
¶1.  Summary:  In a March 23 meeting with Codel Warner, a 
group of Turkish parliamentarians representing both the 
ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) and main 
opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) expressed concerns 
about ongoing violence in Iraq and the PKK presence in 
northern Iraq.  The Codel set out U.S. Iraq strategy and 
encouraged Turkey to share its experience in democracy with 
Iraq.  End Summary. 
 
Shared Interests, Joint Values 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  Turkish parliament National Defense Committee Chair 
Cengiz Kaptanoglu welcomed the Codel and emphasized the U.S. 
and Turkey's shared strategic interests and joint values. 
Senator Warner replied by noting Turkey's pivotal role in the 
region and longstanding cooperation with the U.S.  Senator 
Warner emphasized the importance of diplomacy, but added that 
diplomacy had to be backed up.  Both Senators Warner and 
Levin asked for parliamentarians' views on the region, 
including Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan. 
 
Turkish Concerns:  Iraq and PKK 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  Main opposition CHP MP Sukru Elekdag, Turkey's former 
Ambassador to the U.S., noted falling U.S. public support for 
the Iraq war and asked Senator Warner to explain U.S. Iraq 
strategy.  AKP MP Recep Garip cited as Turkey's chief 
concerns the ongoing violence in Iraq; the future of Kirkuk; 
regional stability; and terrorism.  Elekdag also asked 
pointedly when the U.S. would take action against the PKK in 
northern Iraq. 
 
¶4.  CHP MP Onur Oymen and AKP MP Ramazan Toprak also 
expressed concern over the PKK.  Oymen urged the U.S. to 
allow Turkey to engage in a cross-border operation against 
the PKK. 
 
Explaining U.S. Iraq Strategy 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5.  Senator Warner emphasized the U.S. goal of bringing 
democracy to Iraq and noted the series of successful Iraqi 
elections.  The U.S. is now urging the Iraqis to form a 
national unity government and is strengthening Iraqi security 
forces.  He emphasized President Bush's determination to 
support the Iraqi government.  There is currently no civil 
war in Iraq, Senator Warner concluded, but there could be if 
U.S. troops withdrew prematurely.  Senator Levin added that 
despite different opinions in the U.S. about Iraq, there is 
unity in wanting the new Iraqi government to succeed. 
 
¶6.  Senator Sessions noted unanimity in the U.S. on the issue 
of terrorism.  Iraq is at a critical juncture and it is 
important for both Turkey and the U.S. that Iraq become 
stable, peaceful and prosperous.  Senator Sessions told the 
parliamentarians that the Codel had just been to Iraq and had 
urged the parties to form a government.  Senator Sessions 
encouraged Turkish parliamentarians to share their 
governmental experience with Iraq.  Sessions called PKK 
terrorism unacceptable and said the Codel had noted the 
parliamentarians' concerns. 
 
¶7.  Codel Warner was not able to clear this message before 
leaving Ankara.
