¶1.  (SBU) As of midnight on March 17, Senegalese 
authorities had registered 2,518 refugees and displaced 
persons fleeing the fighting between Bissau-Guinean forces 
and Movement of Democratic Forces of the Casamance (MFDC) 
factions who want peace and Salif Sadio's "Attika" MFDC 
forces (reftel).  The International Committee of the Red 
Cross (ICRC) estimates that another 3,000 persons have 
fled to cities in Guinea-Bissau, including Sao Domingos, 
where food is reportedly in short supply.  Two-thirds of 
those are thought to be Senegalese nationals.  (COMMENT: 
Because MFDC supporters and their families are Senegalese, 
one should not necessarily label civilians fleeing the 
fighting into Senegal as refugees.  END COMMENT.) 
 
¶2.  (U) After a lull over the weekend, the Bissau-Guinean 
military resumed firing artillery on March 20.  The Bissau- 
Guinean Army has reported five dead and at least as many 
wounded.  MFDC and civilian casualties are unknown at 
present. 
 
¶3.  (U) On March 17, Embassy contacted all registered 
AmCits in Guinea-Bissau and in Senegal's southern 
Casamance region.   We continue to monitor the situation 
but do not plan to issue a warden message at this time.
