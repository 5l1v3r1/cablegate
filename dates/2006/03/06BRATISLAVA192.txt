MIDDLE GROUND ON UNSC ISSUES 
 
REF: USUN NEW YORK 424 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  The March 5-7 Bratislava visit of IO A/S 
Kristen Silverberg provided the occasion to engage Slovakia 
on UNSC issues, congratulate the country on two successful 
months at the table, and coordinate our approaches to the 
upcoming challenges of the Council's agenda.  A/S Silverberg 
urged the Slovaks to engage actively in New York on the range 
of issues.  Slovak interlocutors repeatedly framed the 
country as an "honest broker" attempting to occupy the middle 
ground among the U.S., Europe, and Russia.  The consultations 
centered around several themes important to Slovakia: 
 
- KOSOVO: The Slovaks expressed in private the same 
sentiments political officials -- including Minister Kukan -- 
have been making in public: that they are concerned that the 
U.S. is moving too quickly towards a negotiated independence 
for Kosovo that will leave the Serbs feeling disenfranchised. 
 They emphasized that they are not "pro-Serb," but are 
concerned with a "spillover effect" in other areas of "frozen 
conflict" in the region.  However, at the end of the 
discussion, they acknowledged that an internationally 
"forced" solution would allow Serbia to move forward without 
accepting responsibility domestically. 
 
- IRAN:  The Slovaks have identified Iran as a particular 
area of concern, both at the UNSC and IAEA (where they serve 
on the Board of Governors). 
 
- SECURITY SECTOR REFORM:  Slovakia has identified "security 
sector reform" as a possible theme for its UNSC presidency. 
They suggest a PRST on best practices regarding reform of the 
military in countries in transition, borrowing from eastern 
Europe's successful efforts.  A/S Silverberg agreed to close 
contacts on the subject.  END SUMMARY. 
 
SLOVAKIA HOPES BOLTON INITIATIVES WILL CONTINUE 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  During IO A/S Kristen Silverberg's March 5-7 visit 
to Bratislava, Slovak officials repeatedly voiced their 
opinion -- and sought confirmation -- that Slovakia had 
served admirably in its first two months on the UNSC "thanks 
to Ambassador Bolton," MFA Director General Anton Pinter 
commented.  The Slovaks were also eager to discuss their 
priorities for the Council, namely the western Balkans 
(Kosovo), Iran, and the export of "security sector reform. 
The Slovaks have a favorable view on the U.S. presidency in 
February, noting that the discipline brought by Ambassador 
Bolton to the Council needed to be maintained in the future. 
The mentioned Slovakia's wish to be "as active and effective 
as possible" during the next two years. 
 
KOSOVO SLOVAKIA'S MAIN CONCERN 
------------------------------ 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The dominant topic on the Slovak agenda at all 
levels was Kosovo.  State Secretary (Deputy Foreign Minister) 
Magda Vasaryova told Silverberg that Slovakia remains wary of 
the speed of the negotiation process, noting that the 
situation is still "unstable" and that Slovakia -- which 
continues to have troops on the ground as part of the UN PKO 
there -- recognizes that "how to solve the situation is one 
question; the solution itself is another."  Vasaryova 
emphasized that Slovakia is not "pro-Serb," and that critics 
similarly tried to paint the country as "pro-Croat" during 
the early 1990's. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Instead, Slovakia is trying to view Kosovo "as the 
complex situation that it is."  Vasaryova said she agrees 
with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Borys Tarasyuk, who told her 
last month that Kosovo will have an impact in other "frozen 
conflict" areas like Transnistria and the Caucusus.  Slovakia 
will continue to pursue a role as an "honest broker," and 
UNSC Coordinator Marcel Pesko told Silverberg that a Serb 
delegation will visit Bratislava April 11-12 to discuss the 
"UN aspects" of the negotiation process.  Silverberg 
encouraged the Slovaks to continue to actively engage the 
Serbs on the need for resolution.  Pesko noted that Kosovo -- 
unlike other UN issues -- could have domestic political 
ramifications for Slovakia. 
 
AVOIDING A TRANSATLANTIC RIFT ON IRAN 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Pesko told Silverberg that Slovakia's main 
ambition in the Council it to avoid any "Transatlantic rift" 
of opinions on issues like Kosovo and Iran.  While Slovakia 
is preparing for the challenges that Iran's nuclear program 
 
BRATISLAVA 00000192  002 OF 002 
 
 
will pose to the Security Council over the course of the 
coming months, it is also seized with the issue of dialogue 
between the EU and the Muslim world.  Our interlocutors noted 
that they feel Slovakia -- with a negligible Muslim 
population and little trade with the region -- might be 
suited to serve as a non-controversial leader within the EU 
on the topic, as it would be nearly free from domestic 
fallout. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Silverberg took every opportunity to explain the 
USG position on Iran.  Pesko said that Slovakia agrees that a 
Presidential Statement is needed, but added that Slovakia is 
concerned about the speed with which sanctions could be 
levied.  "This is the stick," he noted, "but where is the 
carrot?"  A/S Silverberg reminded Slovaks of the history of 
unsuccessful EU3-Russian engagement with Iran, leading to the 
necessity of UNSC action.  Pinter allowed that the Slovaks -- 
like the Americans -- cannot accept the fact that Iran is 
trying to develop nuclear weapons. 
 
SLOVAKIA DISAGREES ON HRC 
------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  UN and International Organizations Director Roman 
Buzek told Silverberg that Slovakia and the U.S. are not in 
full agreement on the creation of a Human Rights Council 
(HRC), as Slovakia fully endorses the EU position.  Slovakia 
agrees that the current Commission on Human Rights should be 
disbanded after one final "ceremonial" meeting, but said that 
while it thinks the proposal by Eliasson is not "ideal" and 
is only a marginal improvement on the existing body, it is 
the best available and Slovakia will vote for it.  Slovakia 
suggests that a 5 year review of the new body could be 
performed, at which point the body could be modified; 
however, they believe that voting against the current 
proposal would only set back the reform of the current 
structure.  Silverberg and the Ambassador pressured the 
Slovaks at some length on the need for a credible council, 
pointing out that Eliasson's proposal was not negotiated, and 
that he could introduce a new proposal to guarantee the 
credibility of the HRC. 
 
LISTENING MODE ON MIDDLE EAST ISSUES 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶8.  (SBU)  Slovak interlocutors joked that the country was 
lucky it was "only" Vice Chairman of the 1636 Committee, and 
clearly felt a lack of confidence on the issues, telling 
Silverberg they were in "listening mode" and were curious 
about the USG position.  Silverberg explained that Syria must 
fully comply with all UNSC resolutions, must stop meddling in 
Lebanese affairs, and that it must commit to 100 percent 
cooperation -- and nothing less -- with the Brammurtz 
investigation.  On Hamas, Slovakia reiterated its "full 
agreement" with the U.S. 
 
NON-PROLIFERATION AND THE 1540 COMMITTEE 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶9.  (SBU)  Similar to an approach made to USUN last week 
(reftel), our interlocutors at all levels asked about the 
"future" of the 1540 Committee, which Slovakia chairs. 
Vasaryova asked Silverberg what the U.S. thought its new aim 
and focus could be.  Silverberg replied that the USG was 
still considering internally whether to support changes to 
make the committee more effective, but that the U.S. may well 
come forward soon with suggestions. 
 
NO DISAGREEMENT ON DARFUR 
------------------------- 
 
¶10.  (SBU)  Silverberg pressured Slovaks on support for USG 
efforts on Darfur.  Pinter said there would be "no 
disagreement." 
 
¶11.  (U)  A/S Silverberg cleared this cable.
