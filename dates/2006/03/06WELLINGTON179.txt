SUBJECT: SHORTAGE OF HOTEL ACOMMODATION IN WELLINGTON, 
NEW ZEALAND 
 
 
¶1.  During the coming months, Wellington will become increasingly 
popular in the events arena with more cultural and sporting events 
being scheduled, creating a shortage in hotel accommodations. 
 
Particularly difficult periods include: 
6 - 20 April   Art/Culture Events 
12 May - 4 June  Art/Culture Events 
20 - 24 July   Sporting Events 
22 - 30 September  Art/Culture Event 
27 Oct - 5 November  Sporting Events 
 
¶2.  Official visitors are encouraged to confirm their travel plans 
during these periods as far in advance as possible.  Travel orders 
should contain authorization for actual subsistance, as lodging 
within per diem rates during this time could be difficult to obtain. 
 All non-essential travel to Wellington during the above periods 
should be carefully considered.
