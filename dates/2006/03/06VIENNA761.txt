CONSENSUS 
 
 
¶1.  Summary: EU leaders used the the informal "Gymnich" 
meeting of EU foreign ministers on March 10-11 to call for 
continued international consensus as Iran and its nuclear 
program is referred to the UN Security Council -- as well as 
to express hope that a diplomatic solution was still 
possible.  Septels report on discussions on Hamas, Ukraine 
and Belarus.  End Summary. 
 
International Consensus 
----------------------- 
 
¶2.  Austrian Foreign Minister Ursula Plassnik, representing 
Austria's EU Council Presidency, spoke of the need to clarify 
the nature of Iran's nuclear program, pointing to the 
numerous discrepancies highlighted in IAEA reports.  She 
emphasized that Iran's right to the peaceful use of civilian 
nuclear energy is not in question.  She also reported that 
improving the EU's contacts with civil society in Iran was a 
core issue for the EU, as it was important not to isolate the 
Iranian population.  CFSP High Representative Javier Solana 
and Plassnik both noted that the "door remains open" for Iran 
and a diplomatic solution. 
 
¶4.  External Relations Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner 
stressed the need for a compromise solution and urged Iran to 
take the deal offered by Russians.  She maintained her hope 
in a diplomatic solution but lamented Iran's instransigence, 
which has lost it a good deal of international confidence. 
While calling for the international community to remain 
united, Ferrero-Waldner warned against isolating Iran: "We do 
not want to isolate Iran and Iran should not isolate itself." 
 She criticized Iranian President Ahmadinejad's  recent 
remarks as "saber-rattling" not conducive to productive 
negotations. 
 
¶5.  In separate remarks, French Foreign Minister Philippe 
Douste-Blazy stressed that Iran must return to complete 
suspension of enrichment and related activities as well as 
cooperate fully with the IAEA.  The EU should remain at the 
forefront of this issue and stay firm against proliferation, 
he added.  The Europeans are united on this issue, according 
to Douste-Blazy, and are in permanent contact with the U.S., 
China, Russia, and the non-aligned and Islamic worlds. 
 
Progressive Approach in UN Security Council 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Douste-Blazy said that the UN Security Council would take 
a "progressive" approach to the issue and not start with 
punitive actions.  Solana also advocated a gradual approach 
in the UN Security Council, with the first step being a 
statement by the Security Council president.
