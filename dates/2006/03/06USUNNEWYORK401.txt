SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR BOLTON'S MEETING WITH MOROCCAN PERMREP 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In a brief March 2 courtesy call on Ambassador 
Bolton, recently arrived Moroccan Perm Rep El Mostafa SAHEL 
said that Morocco's autonomy proposal for the Western Sahara 
has been completed and that consultations between the 
government of Morocco and Moroccan political parties were 
scheduled to begin March 2.  He said that the government 
hoped to have an agreed document by the end of March. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Sahel said that much of the impetus for this 
proposal has come from King Mohamed VI, for whom economic and 
political reform has been a priority and who views the 
stalemate in the Western Sahara as a barrier to regional 
economic and political development.  He said that King 
Mohamed wants a political solution that will provide the 
region with stability and peace to allow the problems of 
poverty, terrorism and illegal immigration to be addressed. 
He said the proposal would provide "special treatment" for 
the region.  He said that Morocco only asked that the 
proposal preserve Morocco's "integrity and sovereignty."  He 
said Morocco sought "to integrate, not disintegrate, the 
country." 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Sahel said that Morocco is ready to negotiate. 
That said, he suggested that Morocco needed "somebody" with 
whom to discuss this proposal and needed friends to encourage 
Algeria to be that partner.  Of course, he said, the 
Polisario could participate, but "everyone knew that Algeria 
controlled the Polisario and that the Polisario does nothing 
without Algeria."  Sahel confessed to not really being able 
to understand what Algeria wants.  He said that he had spent 
six hours speaking with Algerian President Bouteflika, during 
which they became friends.  But after the conversation Sahel 
still did not know what Algeria sought from Morocco with 
regard to the Western Sahara other than "time." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Ambassador Bolton reviewed his background and 
continuing interest in the Western Sahara, including his work 
in IO when MINURSO was created and later with Personal Envoy 
James Baker.  He said the U.S. is looking forward to a 
Moroccan "substantial proposal" that will change the 
political atmosphere in a positive way, breaking the 
negotiating deadlock of the last 15 years and solving a 
problem that has been around for over three decades.  Once 
the proposal is ready to go, we will move from there.   Sahel 
said that he would update Ambassador Bolton as soon as any 
news develops on the proposal.
