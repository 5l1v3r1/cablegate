¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The Guangdong Provincial and Guangzhou 
Municipal governments' reactions to the recent March 2 human 
avian influenza death were both rather swift and resolute. 
Both levels of government held emergency meetings and 
resolved to limit the sale of live animals in Guangzhou's 
markets and restaurants.  In general the measures parallel 
the reaction taken by the region during the SARS crisis. 
For example, airport authorities have also considered 
mandating temperature checks at the major airports in 
Guangdong province.  However, the real question is whether 
these measures are comprehensive enough and likely to be 
effective.  END SUMMARY. 
 
Guangdong Provincial Government Reaction 
------------------------------------------ 
¶2.  (SBU) On March 6, the Guangdong Provincial Government convened 
a working meeting to communicate instructions from the Party 
Secretary Zhang Dejiang and the Governor Huang Huahua (both 
 
SIPDIS 
of whom are in Beijing attending the National People's 
Congress).  Executive Vice Governor Zhong Yangsheng chaired 
the meeting in their place and offered six key tasks that 
government departments should implement to minimize the AI 
threat.  The six tasks include: 
1)   Improve early detection and response; 
2)   Conduct comprehensive screenings at hospitals; 
3)   Strengthen epidemic surveillance and forecasting; 
4)   Implement a full vaccination policy with every breeding 
farm required to maintain records of vaccinations and follow- 
up antibody tests to check efficacy; 
5)   Strengthen entry/exit inspection and punish illegal 
trading in sick and dead poultry; 
6)   Improve scientific investigative skills and training 
for local veterinarians and health workers. 
 
Guangzhou City Reaction:  Going with the SARS Plan 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
¶3.  (SBU) As of March 3, Guangzhou had activated a Level III 
emergency response alarm, in accordance with the city's 
latest emergency plans.  A few of Guangzhou's best hospitals 
have been designated to handle future AI cases dealing with 
children and the most serious cases. (Note:  Many of these 
hospitals held similar responsibilities during the SARS 
crisis.  End note.)  Under the current alarm system, people 
with respiratory diseases must wear masks when they go to a 
doctor. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On March 6 the government ordered animal sample 
investigations, which were taken from all 12 of the "wet 
markets" the AI victim frequented.  The reported results 
were negative.  On that same day, Guangzhou Mayor Zhang 
Guangning convened a meeting and announced that the live 
animal "wet markets" in the city should close on a rotating 
basis for one day a week.  Mayor Zhang also requested that 
live animal sales be limited in restaurants.  The efficacy 
of such measures is questionable.  The Nanfang Metropolis 
Daily reported that at one closed market, some vendors are 
secretly selling live poultry by putting the caged chickens

in the toilet just beside the stand. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Finally the Guangdong Airport Group convened an 
emergency meeting on March 6 to discuss possible activation 
of temperature checks at its four main airports, namely the 
Baiyun Airport, Shantou Airport, Zhanjiang Airport and 
Meixian Airport.  Such measures were used during the SARS 
crisis as well. 
 
Comment: Guangdong Needs More than Just Talk 
-------------------------------------------- 
¶6.  (SBU) Hong Kong officials banned live poultry imports from 
Guangdong for at least 3 weeks.  Zhong Nanshan, Director of 
 
GUANGZHOU 00006294  002 OF 002 
 
 
the Guangzhou Institute of Respiratory Diseases has warned 
the situation could be worse than it appears.  Zhong argues 
the latest AI case proves that live poultry might carry the 
virus and other animals, for example, cats and pigs, might 
carry a mutated virus as well.  The local government 
reaction is a good first step, but government transparency 
remains a big concern.
