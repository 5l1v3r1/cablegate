SUBJECT: GOE "STUDIES" ALLEGED GOC AIRSPACE VIOLATION 
 
 
¶1.  (U) Two Colombian military aircraft reportedly entered 
Ecuadorian airspace in pursuit of FARC rebels in the border 
town of Puerto Nuevo, Sucumbios province on March 11. 
Representatives from the Colombian and Ecuadorian defense 
ministries met on March 14 on the border to exchange 
information on the alleged airspace violation.  The Ministry 
of Defense has 72 hours to forward their findings to the MFA 
under bilateral accords; findings have not yet been released. 
 
¶2.  (U) Minister of Defense Oswaldo Jarrin on March 14 stated 
publicly that Ecuadorian military radar detected the March 11 
airspace violation, and that the MOD would present this 
information to Colombian Defense Ministry representatives at 
their March 14 meeting on the border between the two 
countries.  Jarrin did not classify the incident as an 
"incursion", but rather stated that GOC forces "violated" 
Ecuadorian airspace and that the incident was under 
investigation.  He refused to speculate further, preferring 
to wait for the full report from the Binational Committee. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment:  The GOE's more measured approach to the 
latest alleged airspace violation suggests that post-incident 
consultations at the operational level are functioning. 
While the GOE will likely formally protest the violation, 
sources suggest that the GOE considers the incident minor, 
and will prefer to keep this incident from escalating to the 
political arena
