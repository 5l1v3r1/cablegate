SUBJECT: MESSAGE ON HOST COUNTRY MEETINGS WITH HAMAS 
DELIVERED 
 
REF: A) STATE 27174 B) CARACAS 00492 C) CARACAS 00503 
 
(SBU) After several unsuccessful attempts to deliver ref A in 
person, Poloff delivered reftel demarche regarding host 
country guidance for meetings with Hamas representatives to 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on March 2 via fax.  (Note: 
The Venezuelan Ministry of Foreign Affairs has increasingly 
refused to engage in face to face contact with Embassy 
employees, and with very few exceptions, is extremely 
reluctant to agree to meetings.)  In a follow-up conversation 
with Third Secretary for North America Robinson Zapata, 
Zapata said he had no substantive response but agreed to pass 
talking points to Vice Minister for North America Maria Pilar 
Hernandez for further consideration.
