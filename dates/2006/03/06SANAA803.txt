SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR MEETS WITH NEW MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS 
AND HIGHWAYS 
 
 
On March 15, Ambassador met with the newly appointed Minister 
of Public Works and Highways, Omar al-Kurshemi. Ambassador 
congratulated the Minister on his appointment.  The two 
discussed the ministry's biggest project, a highway from Aden 
to Ammran.  The project is estimated to cost USD 1.4 billion. 
 Ambassador told al-Kurshemi that the USG funds smaller roads 
for development purposes and offered that the highway project 
might find funding through an international tender. 
Ambassador told the Minister that he had an earlier 
discussion with the President on increasing transparency in 
Yemen's tender processes with the possibility of allowing 
international observers to monitor the next major 
international tender. The Minister agreed that the tender 
process should be transparent and he stated that one of his 
top priorities will be to eliminate corruption, especially in 
the tender process.
