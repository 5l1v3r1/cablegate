¶1. (SBU) On March 15, Yevhen Koziy, Executive Director of 
the GUAM Information Office, informed INLOff that experts 
from GUAM member states (Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, 
Moldova), and not the National Coordinators (NCs) as stated 
in ref A, participated in the March 13-14 meeting in Kiev 
to finalize the new Charter for GUAM.  The meeting 
succeeded, he said, in resolving all substantive issues 
except for how the organization's new decision making 
structures should look and function.  Azerbaijan continued 
to hold the dissenting view (ref B).  Koziy believed the 
NCs would meet within two weeks to resolve the remaining 
"political" issue. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Koziy confirmed that the draft Charter included a 
commitment to expand the current GUAM Information Center to 
a Secretariat.  Regarding funding for the current 
Information Center, despite ref C demarche, Ukraine 
continued to be the only member of the four countries to 
have paid its 2005 dues to the Information Center. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On March 14, Koziy said, he had signed a contract 
for the design of the GUAM web page with the same web site 
design company that had produced the web sites for the MFA 
and National Security and Defense Council.
