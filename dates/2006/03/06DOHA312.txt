REF: 05 Doha 1593 
 
¶1. (SBU) In an effort to maintain brand identity and 
consistency of message and quality, the GOQ established in 
late 2005 (reftel) an entity known as the Al Jazeera Network 
(AJN), charged with overseeing all bodies bearing the Al 
Jazeera brand name. On March 1, an Amiri decree announced 
the establishment of the AJN board of directors. The Board 
includes present Al Jazeera Arabic Managing Director Wadah 
Khanfar. The key position of AJN Managing Director, which 
will wield significant operational authority and influence 
over the brand's editorial policy, has yet to be filled. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to press statements, the seven-member 
board will include: 
 
-- Shk. Hamad Bin Thamer Al Thani, Chairman. Hamad bin 
Thamer is currently the chairman of the Al Jazeera board, as 
well as of the Qatar TV & Radio Corporation. 
 
-- Khalaf Ahmed Al Manni, Vice Chairman - long-time number 
two of Hamad bin Thamer. 
 
-- Ahmed Abdallah Al Kholaifi. 
 
-- Abdallah Mubarak Al Kholaifi- Currently Director of Human 
Resources at Qatar TV. 
 
-- Dr. Elham Bader Al Sada, a respected academic, currently 
a presenter at Qatar TV & Radio Corporation. A popular as 
well as somewhat controversial Qatari personality, she hosts 
a lively morning show on Qatari national radio that 
sometimes takes a critical stance on domestic issues, 
including nationality and sponsorship laws. A Qatari 
citizen, she is married to a Jordanian and her mother is of 
Palestinian origin. 
 
-- Mahmoud Shammam, Washington Bureau Chief of Newsweek in 
Arabic. An American citizen of Libyan descent, Shammam lives 
in Washington and is known to be close to the Amir, Sheikha 
Mozah and to key officials at the Amiri Diwan in Doha. Known 
for his liberal and anti-Islamist views, as well as for his 
criticism of Al Jazeera and its editorial policy, Shammam is 
also prominent among Libyan opposition figures. 
 
--  Wadah Khanfar. Currently Managing Director of Al Jazeera 
Arabic satellite channel. Rumor has it that Khanfar is 
angling for the job of AJN Managing Director. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The AJN Board will oversee all of Al Jazeera's 
numerous offshoots. These - now representing a veritable 
media empire - include: 
 
-- Al Jazeera Arabic, est. 1996 
-- Al Jazeera International, to be launched May 2006. 
-- Al Jazeera Arabic website (currently under AJ editorial 
control). 
-- Al Jazeera English website (currently under AJI editorial 
control). 
-- Al Jazeera Mubashir: Est. 2005. Live conferences, 
meetings, discussions, comparable C-span, no anchors, no 
editing process. 
-- Al Jazeera Sports, est. 2003. 24/7 sports news channel. 
-- Al Jazeera Children's Channel - est. 2005, targets Arabic- 
speaking children aged 3-15; billed as "edutainment" 
-- Al Jazeera Documentary - to be launched 2006. 24-hour 
Arabic programming, comparable to the Discovery Channel. 
-- Al Jazeera Training Center - est. Feb 2004, providing 
training to AJ and regional journalists; eyeing a regional 
role in media reform efforts. 
-- Al Jazeera Center for Studies - Doha-based think tank, 
est. 2005; designed to provide an academic Arab perspective 
on socio-political-economic issues affecting the region. 
-- Al Jazeera Mobile, bilingual, SMS-based breaking news 
service. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The next step will be to name the managing director 
of the Al Jazeera Network, a key operational position that 
will wield considerable influence and play a key role in 
shaping editorial policy across the Arabic and English TV 
channels and websites, as well as in resolving the 
considerable tension currently existing between the Arabic 
and English channels.
