REF: USUN NEW YORK 567 
 
¶1.  On Thursday March 23, 2006, Embassy received Diplomatic 
Note number 961 from the Moroccan MFA, requesting USG support 
for its candidature to the newly-created UN Human Rights 
Council (reftel).  A copy of the diplomatic note has been 
faxed separately to NEA/MAG. 
 
¶2.  Begin text of GOM translation of diplomatic note: 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the 
Kingdom of Morocco presents its compliments to the Embassy of 
the United States of America and has the honor to inform the 
latter that the government of the Kingdom of Morocco has 
decided to submit the Moroccan candidature to the newly 
established Human Rights Council. 
 
--Elected by the ECOSOC as a member of the Commission of 
Human Rights for a mandate from January, 1st, 2006 to 
December 31st, 2008, the Kingdom of Morocco hopes to be able 
to contribute, together with the other members of the 
Council, to the respect of universally admitted human rights 
and fundamental freedoms. 
 
--The Kingdom of Morocco has strongly supported the process 
establishing the Human Rights Council, since the beginning, 
and considers that such an organ represents a renewed, 
efficient and adequate framework to consolidate the 
international accomplishments with regard to human rights and 
to reinforce international consensus in this field. 
 
--The Kingdom of Morocco, which adhered to all pertinent 
international instruments, firmly believes that a genuine 
consolidation of the state of law and democracy are the best 
guarantees for a sustained development of individuals and 
groups alike. 
 
--Besides, in a daring path of political and social reforms, 
the Kingdom of Morocco achieved, in the framework of the 
ongoing process, some outstanding accomplishments, that 
concerned the promotion of women's and children's rights as 
well as the protection of persons in difficult situation. 
 
--Furthermore, the Kingdom of Morocco, whose respect of 
international commitments is a constitutional principle, 
undertakes actively to make its national legislation in 
conformity with international standards, by revising certain 
legal provisions, removing reserves, submitting regular 
national reports and consecrating the primacy of 
international law over national legislations. 
 
--The recent publication of the final report of the Equity 
and Reconciliation Commission  (IER) and the directives given 
by His Majesty the King to the Advisory Council of Human 
Rights (CCDH) to implement IER's recommendations, testify to 
Morocco's clear and irreversible willingness to open up a new 
chapter of its modern history, as illustrated in the 
revisiting of past human rights violations, the compensation 
of the victims, and the implementing of legal and practical 
measures, to prevent similar violations from occurring in the 
future. 
 
--In addition to the accomplishments made in the fields of 
civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights 
(Family Code, Ombudsman, law against torture, code of 
political parties, etc...), the Government of the Kingdom of 
Morocco also launched the National Initiative for Human 
Development (INDH) which represents an integrated plan aimed 
at reducing social disparities and achieving a sustained and 
harmonious social and economic development, based on 
proximity, good governance, objective-oriented projects and a 
transparent and rational allocation of budget resources. 
 
--On the regional and international levels, the Kingdom of 
Morocco, as a crossroads of multiple civilizations, has 
always advocated all its efforts to the promotion of peace, 
understanding, cooperation between the people and 
inter-religious and intercultural dialogue. 
 
--The Government of the Kingdom of Morocco requests the 
valuable support of the government of the United States of 
America, for its candidature to the Human Right Council, 
during the elections that will be held on May 19th, 2006. 
 
 
--The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the 
Kingdom of Morocco avails itself of this opportunity to renew 
to the esteemed Embassy of the United States of America the 
assurances of its highest consideration and esteem.
