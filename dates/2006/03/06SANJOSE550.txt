Per reftel, Poloff communicated talking points to Victor 
Murillo in the Multilateral Affairs office of the Foreign 
Ministry.  Murillo confirmed that the GOCR intends to sign 
the Third Additional Protocol, but that the process is 
cumbersome and slow.  The Foreign Ministry is preparing the 
Protocol for submission to the Legislative Assembly, which is 
expected to approve signature authority.  Based on past 
performance, it is unlikely the Assembly will address the 
issue before the June conference.
