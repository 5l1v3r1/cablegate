SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION - IRAQ 
 
 
On March 4, conservative, influential newspaper-of-record "El 
Mercurio" (circ. 116,807) ran a weekly round-up column entitled, 
"The Difficult Creation of a Government."  Quote: 
 
"To withdraw hastily from Iraq does not seem to be the solution to 
today's problem.  To continue the current gradual withdrawal program 
or move to a mass withdrawal could be dangerous because the Iraqi 
military and police forces are not capable of replacing the foreign 
forces.  Maintaining or reinforcing the current contingent could 
even be counterproductive because many feel the occupation forces 
are responsible for inciting violence. Either way there is the 
threat of creating greater chaos in Iraq, which is why the White 
House's challenge is enormous."
