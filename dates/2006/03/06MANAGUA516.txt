(SBU) Although the GON was initially cool towards the Third 
Additional Protocol in late 2005 (reftel B), Foreign Minister 
Norman Caldera told the Ambassador on March 7 that the GON is 
now inclined to sign the protocol.  However, Caldera stated 
that the GON would like to be approached directly by the 
Israeli government on the issue.
