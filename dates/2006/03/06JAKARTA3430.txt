¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Local joint venture PT IPB Shigeta has 
launched an AI vaccine for poultry called CLOSE 5.1 using 
reverse genetic engineering.  The firm plans to initially 
produce 180 million doses a year and distribute them 
throughout Asia.  The Governor of East Java told the press 
on March 14 that laboratory tests of seven people with 
suspected avian influenza symptoms have returned negative. 
He thus declared his province free of AI in humans.  The 
total number of confirmed human AI cases in Indonesia rose 
to 30 (with 22 deaths) on March 12 when Hong Kong University 
confirmed the H5N1 virus in a recently deceased 12-year old 
girl from Solo, Central Java.  End Summary.

an AI vaccine for poultry called CLOSE 5.1.  The firm 
reportedly used reverse genetic engineering of a local 
strain of the H5N1 virus originating from Legok, Banten 
province, to develop the vaccine.  According to the article, 
the U.S. biotechnology company MedImmune Inc owns the 
patent, but IPB Shigeta has a license to produce the 
vaccine.   The Tropical Disease Center of the University of 
Airlangga-Surabaya reportedly tested the safety the CLOSE 
5.1 vaccine and deemed it safe and effective. 
 
¶2. (U) PT. IPB Shigeta reportedly said since it has obtained 
a temporary production registration number for its CLOSE5.1 
vaccine and is ready to produce 180 million dosages per year 
with a sales target of 8.5 billion yen (USD 72.6 million). 
The company will distribute the product beginning in April 
to mostly Asian markets.  IPB Shigeta reportedly said it 
will establish the its first production facility at the 
Veterinary Faculty of the Bogor Institute of Agriculture 
(IPB) complex, in Bogor, West Java.  The firm will 
reportedly also build another plant soon, with a monthly 
production capacity of 100 million dosages.  The IPB-owned 
PT. Bogor Life Science and Technology claimed that annual 
demand for AI poultry vaccines in 2005 reached 517 million 
dosages. 
 
Governor Says No Human AI East Java 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶3. (U) According to a March 14 article in the Surbaya daily 
Surya, East Java Governor Imam Utomo said that laboratory 
tests have confirmed that all seven patients allegedly 
showing symptoms of bird flu were free of the H5N1 AI virus. 
The governor reportedly said "East Java is free from that 
deadly virus.  It means that up to now there is no one in 
this province infected with the virus."
