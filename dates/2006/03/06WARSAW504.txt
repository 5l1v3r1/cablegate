¶1. SUMMARY: Polish President Lech Kaczynski and Defense 
Minister (DefMin) Sikorski announced their shared intention 
to accelerate modernization of the Polish military at a press 
conference following the annual meeting of Defense Ministry 
and Armed Forces leadership on March 13.  Their plan includes 
increased defense spending as well as continued engagement in 
Iraq and Afghanistan.  Kaczynski and Sikorski also addressed 
reporters' questions on military intelligence reform and 
Poland's possible participation in the U.S. Missile Defense 
system.  President Kaczynski's strong endorsement of a 
modern, robust national defense, ready to operate with allies 
abroad, challenges DefMin Sikorski and the Polish defense 
establishment to move forward with defense transformation. 
END SUMMARY.

Defense Meeting Resolved to Accelerate Modernization 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2. The annual meeting of Defense Ministry and Armed Forces 
leadership on March 13 was closed to the press, but President 
Lech Kaczynski and DefMin Sikorski briefed the media 
afterwards.  Meeting participants included: Senate Speaker 
Bogdan Borusewicz; Interior Minister (and Deputy PM) Ludwik 
Dorn; Chief of the General Staff LtGen Franciszek Gagor; the 
three service chiefs (Army, Navy and Air Force) and others. 
The group reviewed their progress toward the goals of 2005 
and outlined new objectives for the future.  In summary, 
Kaczynski described the condition of the Polish Armed Forces 
as "satisfactory."  On that point, he emphasized that further 
strengthening of Poland's military would enhance the nation's 
standing in Europe and the world.

Path to Modernization: Spending and Deployments 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶3. Kaczynski announced his intention to accelerate military 
modernization by increasing expenditures on modern armaments. 
 In support of this goal, DefMin Sikorski announced the 
government's plan to submit a bill to parliament that would 
peg defense spending at 2% of the subsequent year's projected 
GDP vice the current practice of spending 1.95% of the 
previous year's GDP.  Even with a conservative projection of 
3% Polish GDP growth annually, this change would amount to an 
8.8% jump in defense spending if enacted. 
 
¶4. Kaczynski underscored the value of stabilization missions, 
including those in Iraq and Afghanistan, to Poland and the 
world.  In his view, these missions enhance Poland's 
international prestige while improving the combat 
capabilities of Polish troops.  The President recalled that 
Poland will complete its current mission in Iraq in 2006, but 
he did not exclude the possibility of extending into 2007 
under "appropriate circumstances."  He went on to mention 
Poland's "very serious obligations" in Afghanistan in 2007. 
(NOTE: Though the extent and nature of Polish participation 
in the ISAF command structure in 2007 remains unclear, the 
GOP has already signaled its willingness to join a Provincial 
Reconstruction Team in Afghanistan, in addition to its ISAF 
role.)

Press Queries on Intel Reform and Missile Defense 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶5. Asked by reporters about the future of the Military 
Information Services (WSI), Kaczynski and Sikorski revealed 
details of legislation to be submitted later on March 13 on 
WSI reform.  As reported reftel, this legislation would 
abolish WSI June 30, and create two new military structures - 
one external for intelligence and one for counterintelligence 
- as of July 1.  According to Kaczynski, Sikorski as DefMin 
would exercise day-to-day supervision of the new services but 
the Minister-Coordinator for Special Services, Zbigniew 
Wassermann, would have full access to information gathered by 
the services (similar to the U.S. DNI relationship with DIA). 
 Although WSI has been exclusively staffed by military 
personnel, Sikorski noted that the proposed legislation would 
welcome civilian employees into the two new services. 
 
¶6. In response to a reporter's question about potential 
Polish participation in a global U.S. missile defense system, 
President Kaczynski made two points.  First, he noted that 
Poland must receive an official proposal on Missile Defense 
from Washington before making any decision.  Second, he 
emphasized that the whole issue of Missile Defense had 
enormous political and strategic implications, which the GOP 
would have to consider carefully before making its decision.

Kaczynski Has Reaffirmed Nationalistic Perspective 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶7. COMMENT: President Kaczynski's statements at the March 13 
press conference reaffirmed his oft expressed patriotism and 
reinforced the impression that he, and his Law and Justice 
(PiS) party, believe that a strong, modern military is a key 
component of international influence.  He eschewed some of 
the more inward looking rhetoric he has occasionally used. 
By publicly expressing the political will to move forward on 
effective defense transformation, Kaczynski has left 
Sikorski's MOD and the Polish military leadership with the 
challenge of implementing this vision.  END COMMENT.
