SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (11/2): Palestinians disappointed 
in Secretary Clinton's statements 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The three dailies run prominent coverage on the Palestinian 
Authority's (PA) reaction to Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 
recent statements regarding the resumption of Israeli-Palestinian 
negotiations before Israel agrees to a complete freeze of settlement 
activities. Al-Quds runs a headline that quotes PA Presidency 
spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeina saying, "America has retreated from 
its earlier promises and could not fulfill its commitments." 
Al-Ayyam's leading headline says "Palestinian disappointment from 
Clinton's statements," while an Al-Hayat Al-Jadida headline reads 
"Disappointment in Palestine and relief in Israeli regarding the US 
retreat." 
 
All dailies also carry front page reports on an armed Jewish settler 
trying to get into Al-Aqsa Mosque yesterday at dawn. The guards of 
the mosque caught him and prevented him from entering the mosque. 
 
Al-Quds front pages news on PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad 
reiterating during the opening of the Expo-tech exhibition in 
Ramallah yesterday that the Palestinian government is committed to 
building an independent state and developing its institutions 
despite the Israeli occupation. Fayyad said this has become the 
daily slogan for the Palestinian people. 
 
Al-Quds Hamas radio reports on the Deputy Chairman of the 
Palestinian Legislative Council in Gaza Ahamd Bahar noting that 
Hamas has nothing to fear by holding presidential and legislative 
elections, but noted that due to the security situation in the West 
Bank, Hamas will not be able to participate in the elections.

Weekend stories: 
---------------- 
 
Sunday, November 1 
 
The three dailies lead with stories on PA President Mahmoud Abbas's 
rejection of Secretary Clinton's offer to resume final status 
negotiations in exchange for Israel halting settlement activities 
except for the construction of 3,000 settlement units in the West 
Bank. The deal also totally excluded Jerusalem. Speaking at a press 
conference after the meeting, President Abbas said "We stressed our 
position that peace has requirements, and the most important one is 
the full cessation of settlement activities." Responding to a 
question about Jerusalem, President Abbas said "it was the main 
issue of discussion with Secretary Clinton," stressing that 
"Jerusalem is in danger and the Arabs and Muslims should pay good 
attention to that." President Abbas added that "peace starts in 
Jerusalem," and that without Jerusalem, "I don't think there will be 
peace with Israel." 
 
Al Quds and Al Ayyam run front page stories on Secretary Clinton 
calling on Israelis and Palestinians to resume negotiations "as soon 
as possible" without any pre-conditions. According to the reports, 
Secretary Clinton rejected the Palestinian condition for resuming 
negotiations with Israel only after the latter agreed to a complete 
settlement freeze, saying that the issue should be discussed during 
negotiations. 
 
The three dailies run front page stories on Prime Minister Fayyad 
condemning an armed attack by a number of settlers in Beit Safafa, 
 
JERUSALEM 00001969  002 OF 003 
 
 
which led to the injury of five Palestinians. Fayyad stressed that 
"this terrorist attack by settlers against the lives and properties 
of defenceless Palestinians shows the need to provide immediate 
international protection for our people in Jerusalem and its 
surrounding areas, as well as in the rest of the occupied 
Palestinian territories, until the establishment of our independent 
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, when the state will 
be able to fully protect the security of its citizens." 
 
Al Ayyam runs a front page story reporting that the US Congress will 
vote on a bill that calls upon President Obama and Secretary Clinton 
to reject any discussion of or support for the Goldstone report. The 
sponsors of the bill, which is expected to have the support of 
Democrats and Republicans, stated that the report is "completely 
biased." The text of the bill also reiterates US support for Israel. 
 
 
Saturday, October 31 
 
All three dailies run front page coverage of President Abbas's 
Friday meeting in Abu Dhabi with the Special Envoy George Mitchell. 
Presidency spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeineh told Al Ayyam following 
the meeting, "Despite the continued American efforts ... there is no 
progress whatsoever regarding the cessation of all settlement 
activities by Israel." 
 
Attacks by Israeli right-wing extremists and settlers at private 
homes in Beit Safafa also receive front page coverage in all the 
dailies. The settlers arrived at the homes as family members were 
getting ready to go to Friday prayers and started attacking them 
with metal tools and weapons. A spokesperson for the Israeli police 
said, "Six Israeli right-wing activists arrived at the Salah 
family's houses and showed documents claiming their ownership over 
the houses, demanding the residents evacuate their homes. This led 
to clashes between the settlers and the local residents." Israeli 
police forces arrested the Israeli attackers, according to the 
reports. 
 
The three dailies also run front page coverage on scores of citizens 
and solidarity activists sustaining injuries as a result of tear gas 
fired by Israeli soldiers against participants in the weekly 
anti-wall protests at Ni'ilin and Bil'in. A child was also injured 
in the Al Ma'sara weekly anti-Wall protests. Palestinian protesters 
were joined by dozens of international solidarity and peace 
activists from Sweden, Spain, and Norway. 
 
Al Quds runs a front page story about Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barakat's 
plan to build a large forum for hosting events in East Jerusalem. 
According to the plan, the area would include a large "national 
park" that will accommodate 30,000-50,000 people. The report noted 
that this initiative is a part of Barkat's policy to strengthen 
culture in Jerusalem.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title "The 
Peace Process Reached a Dead End" (11/02): "The US proposal to 
resume negotiations without the cessation of settlement activities 
is very disappointing. It dealt a hard blow to peace efforts and 
shows the US bias to the illegal Israeli occupation. It also 
contradicts the earlier goals that President Obama announced 
regarding the peace process".
