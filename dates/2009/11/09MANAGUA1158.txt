GON officials with responsibilities for food safety have refused 
our repeated attempts to schedule a meeting with them to deliver 
reftel talking points.  Post has sent hard copies of the FDA 
Reportable Food Registry information to them.  We are attempting to 
inform industry about the registry through various chambers and 
professional associations.  Post will report any further 
substantive developments as they arise.
