SUBJECT: QAZI URGES COUNCIL TO CURB AVAILABILITY OF WEAPONS 
IN SOUTHERN SUDAN 
 
¶1.  Summary:  In his last briefing before the Security 
Council, SRSG Qazi labeled mistrust between the parties to 
the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) as the biggest 
challenge to its implementation. Qazi discussed the 
increasing tribal violence in the south and urged the 
Security Council to adopt a mechanism to curb availability of 
weapons.  Qazi also addressed protection of civilians and 
welcomed the new U.S. Sudan strategy.  Ambassador Rice 
introduced the strategy and emphasized, along with Council 
members,that elections and the referenda are vital CPA 
benchmarks that must be met.  She also expressed concern over 
increasing violence and the deteriorating humanitarian 
situation. Members discussed resolution of the Darfur 
conflict as essential to CPA implementation.  End Summary. 
 
Qazi: Increasing Violence and Weapons Flow 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  On October 28, the Special Representative of the 
Secretary General to the UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) Ashraf 
Qazi briefed the Council on the Secretary General's October 
21 report.  Qazi identified lack of trust between the parties 
as the greatest obstacle to CPA implementation.  He 
recognized U.S. efforts to reinvigorate international 
engagement with Sudan and spoke favorably of the U.S. Sudan 
strategy presented by the Secretary, Ambassador Rice and 
Special Envoy Gration on October 19. 
 
¶3.  Qazi discussed the surge in violence in the South, noting 
that women and children had been the primary victims, 
something that has not been seen before in tribal conflicts. 
Qazi said that easy access to weapons had fueled this 
violence, and he urged the international community to 
consider mechanisms that would curb the availability of 
weapons in the South. 
 
¶4.  Qazi also described the UN's three-pronged approach to 
protection of civilians: encouraging the Government of 
Southern Sudan (GOSS) to take the lead in protecting 
civilians in order to instill public confidence in the 
government; strengthening UNMIS' state-level presence; and 
using military patrols to complement civil staff presence in 
hot spots.  Qazi said that UNMIS had considered using as a 
model the joint protection teams established in the UN 
Mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) but 
concluded that this model would not be appropriate for UNMIS. 
 
 
Council: A Comprehensive Approach to Sudan 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶5.  Ambassador Rice briefed the Council on the three 
strategic objectives of U.S. Sudan policy: a definitive end 
to conflict in Darfur; effective implementation of the CPA 
leading to a peaceful post-2011 Sudan or an orderly path 
toward two separate and viable states; and ensuring that 
Sudan does not provide safe haven for terrorists.  Rice 
expressed concern over the ability of Sudanese to participate 
meaningfully in elections, increasing violence in the South, 
and deterioration of the humanitarian situation.  Ambassador 
Rice asked Qazi whether the Secretariat had information about 
the source for the influx of weapons in the South and 
requested clarification about why the MONUC joint protection 
team model was not applicable to UNMIS. 
 
¶6.  France and the UK urged the Secretariat to fill vacant 
leadership positions in UNMIS.  Russia observed that the 
situation in Darfur could negatively impact the CPA.  Turkey 
and Vietnam agreed that resolution of the conflict in Darfur 
and CPA implementation must be addressed together, and Turkey 
cautioned that rebels should see April 2010 as a deadline and 
participate in elections or risk losing legitimacy.  Uganda 
and Costa Rica urged the Council to examine the Lord's 
Resistance Army (LRA) threat from a regional perspective. 
China and Libya focused on positive developments in Sudan: 
the peaceful acceptance by both parties of the Abyei border 
decision, adoption of the national election law and 
establishment of the National Election Council. 
 
Qazi Responds 
------------- 
 
¶7.  Responding to Ambassador Rice's question about the source 
of weapons flows to the South, Qazi said that the Secretariat 
had no concrete evidence but was aware of deep suspicions 
held by GOSS officials that Khartoum was providing arms. 
Qazi said that UNMIS did not have a mandate to investigate 
weapons trafficking and could merely monitor, observe, and 
verify the presence of weapons.  Regarding the joint 
protection team model, Qazi said that the difference between 
UNMIS and MONUC was that MONUC is a Chapter 7 mission, 
 
USUN NEW Y 00000984  002 OF 002 
 
 
whereas UNMIS is a Chapter 6 mission with a limited mandate 
for protection of civilians.  He also noted that UNMIS has 
civilian presence throughout Sudan, unlike MONUC.
