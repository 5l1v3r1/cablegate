RWANDAN AGRICULTURE MEETING 
 
¶1. (SBU) During a November 24 meeting with USAID econoff, 
Chinese Embassy economic counselor Wang Qin said a delegation 
consisting of agriculture experts and Chinese Export-Import 
Bank representatives would attend the Comprehensive Africa 
Agriculture Development Program (CAADP) conference scheduled 
for December 7-8 in Kigali. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Wan said that part of the recent China-Africa summit 
in Egypt dealt with agriculture, but that the Chinese 
government does not have plans to support agriculture in 
Rwanda as much as it does in other countries because Rwanda's 
hilly terrain makes farming very difficult.  Chinese aid is 
accordingly modest, and includes rice demonstration plots and 
research, as well as assistance with bamboo handicraft 
production. 
 
¶3. (SBU) COMMENT: Although President Kagame has made it clear 
he seeks closer economic ties with China as part of Rwanda's 
overall development strategy, Chinese-Rwandan cooperation on 
agriculture remains quite limited.  END COMMENT.
