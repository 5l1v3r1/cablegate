¶1. (SBU) The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) announced November 12 that it 
had investigated and cleared Ratanakiri Provincial Court Judge Thor 
Saron of accusations of misconduct.  The unusual investigation into 
the judge's behavior came at the request of the King, who was 
responding to calls from civil society groups for Judge Thor's 
removal.  The Cambodian Center for Human Rights (CCHR) had accused 
Judge Thor of acquiring 100 hectares of land near the site of a long 
running dispute in exchange for dropping charges against 10 ethnic 
minority villagers involved in the dispute.  CCHR also alleged that 
the judge was illegally using a vehicle confiscated in 2008 as 
evidence in a robbery case. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Judge Thor has been involved in two high-profile land 
dispute cases in Ratanakiri Province, which has brought him under 
the scrutiny of local human rights NGOs.  He is the current 
investigating judge assigned to handle the Kong Yu case, in which a 
group of ethnic minority villagers have accused Keat Kolney, sister 
of the Minister of Economy and Finance, of illegally seizing land 
for a rubber plantation (Ref A).  He is also the presiding judge in 
the case of Cambodian developer the DM Group, which is engaged in a 
land dispute with two villages.  After summoning Cambodian Human 
Rights and Development Association (ADHOC) representative Pen Bonnar 
for questioning on incitement charges related to the DM Group 
dispute, Judge Thor publicly suggested that charges would not be 
brought against Pen if ADHOC removed him from Ratanakiri (Ref B). 
ADHOC removed Pen from the province, but the Court pressed charges 
anyway. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Thor raised NGO suspicions again in early September when he 
submitted a request to Lumphat District authorities requesting 100 
hectares of land for his livestock, located near the village of 10 
individuals whom he was prosecuting on criminal charges related to 
the DM Group dispute.  A commune official told NGOs and the press 
that local leaders had offered Judge Thor land in exchange for 
dropping the charges against the villagers, although the judge's 
request made no mention of the criminal case.  In a September 22 
press article, Judge Thor raised further questions from civil 
society by admitting that for over a year he had been using a 
vehicle confiscated by police during a robbery investigation. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On October 12, the MOJ launched an investigation into the 
judge's alleged misconduct, at the request of the King.  A team from 
the MOJ's General Inspection Department traveled to the province in 
late October to conduct interviews with Judge Thor, local officials, 
and village representatives.  Announcing their findings on November 
12, the MOJ investigators stated that Judge Thor's ownership of the 
land in question seemed to be legitimate, as no villagers had denied 
Judge Thor's ownership.  The investigators' report failed to address 
the allegations of misconduct.  Similarly, the investigators found 
that Judge Thor's use of a seized vehicle for over a year was 
permissible, because the vehicle was used for "public interests", 
such as transporting prisoners.  Civil society groups immediately 
criticized the MOJ's findings; ADHOC's President said that the 
investigation had "not provided justice", and noted that his 
organization would file a separate complaint against Judge Thor 
regarding his conduct in the Pen Bonnar case. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT:  Although Thor Saron seems to have escaped 
disciplinary action for now, his case is notable in that it is one 
of a number of recent human rights cases in which King Sihamoni has 
become involved, possibly signaling an effort by the monarchy to 
speak out more.  The case also highlights the continuing general 
lack of understanding about the Land Law.  Regardless of how the 
local community, provincial authorities, and the MOJ perceive 
ownership, per law the land in question could not be "given" to 
Judge Thor without being registered in the national cadastre.  And 
if it were communal property belonging to the ethnic minority groups 
in the area, the Land Law states that they would need to agree as a 
community to sell or give a piece of the land to an individual.
