SUBJECT: DIRECTOR'S MEETING WITH KAOHSIUNG MAYOR CHEN CHU 
 
SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED, PLEASE PROTECT ACCORDINGLY 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  In her November 18 meeting with Director 
Stanton, Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu reiterated familiar DPP themes, 
maintaining that the KMT was rolling back Taiwan's democracy and 
using the judiciary to persecute the DPP.  Mayor Chen chided 
President Ma for tilting too far toward China and called on the U.S. 
to help support Taiwan's democracy.  She highlighted Kaohsiung 
City's low-key approach to U.S. beef, stating that the DPP's main 
concern was the Ma administration's lack of transparency.  Facing a 
tough 2010 reelection challenge, Mayor Chen has been working to win 
over wavering deep-Green voters in the city.  With the Mayor's 
prominence increasing among DPP supporters island-wide, a reelection 
win could pave the way for a Presidential run in 2012.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) During his November 18 visit to Kaohsiung, Director 
Stanton co-hosted the Megaports commissioning ceremony at Kaohsiung 
Port, officially opened the American Corner at Kaohsiung's Baochu 
Public Library and paid a courtesy call on Kaohsiung Mayor Chen Chu. 
 DPP Mayor Chen had just returned to Kaohsiung from a round of 
campaigning for DPP candidates throughout Taiwan in the run up to 
December's local elections.  Riding a wave of positive reviews among 
DPP supporters for her handling of the 2009 World Games in 
Kaohsiung, her open embrace of the Dalai Lama's September visit to 
southern Taiwan, and her insistence on screening a Rebiya Kadeer 
documentary in the city, Mayor Chen has been increasingly in demand 
island-wide to stump for the party. 
 
DPP: KMT Degrading Taiwan's Democracy 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In a pre-meeting photo spray with some 20 local reporters, 
Mayor Chen offered brief opening remarks, stating to the Director 
that Taiwan and the U.S. shared similar values.  She recounted the 
DPP's long struggle to promote human rights in Taiwan and voiced her 
hope that Taiwan would never return to the days of martial law when 
basic rights were constantly at risk.  Alluding to her view that the 
KMT government was rolling back Taiwan's democracy, she stressed 
that Taiwan should be able to enjoy living in a democratic society 
which fully respected human rights.  She thanked the Director for 
the U.S.'s longstanding support for Taiwan and expressed her 
determination to ensure the safety and well-being of all Americans 
in Kaohsiung. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) After the press departed, Mayor Chen pressed her point 
that the KMT was degrading Taiwan's democracy.  She said that the 
DPP wanted to keep close relations with the U.S. because it believed 
the U.S. would help Taiwan protect its freedom and democracy.  She 
acknowledged that the DPP's 2008 Presidential election defeat was 
the "people's choice" and that Chen Shui-bian and his family's 
corruption had contributed to the loss.  She maintained, however, 
that the KMT had been using the judiciary to suppress the DPP and 
expressed doubt that former President Chen would receive a fair 
hearing. 
 
Mayor Chen: Ma Too Tilted Towards China 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Criticizing President Ma's cross-Strait policy as tilting 
too far toward China, Mayor Chen maintained that the DPP wanted to 
pursue a positive dialogue with China but would not allow China to 
"destroy Taiwan."  She criticized China's boycott of Kaohsiung over 
the Rebiya Kadeer film showing, stating that China was treating 
Taiwan like a "little brother" and undermining its freedom of 
expression.  China favored President Ma and the KMT, she continued, 
but President Ma still had an obligation to uphold Taiwan's values 
and dignity.  If Taiwan signed an Economic Cooperation Framework 
Agreement(ECFA) with China, she worried, Taiwan's sovereignty would 
suffer. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Mayor Chen noted that Taiwan's KMT martial law-era 
government had imprisoned her for more than two years for taking 
part in pro-democracy demonstrations during the December 1979 
Formosa Incident in Kaohsiung.  December 2009 marked the Formosa 
Incident's 30th anniversary, Chen related, and Kaohsiung planned to 
 
TAIPEI 00001397  002 OF 002 
 
 
mark the occasion with a large-scale event involving some 20,000 
participants.  Chen said she hoped the event would remind Taiwan's 
citizens of the sacrifices made to promote Taiwan's democracy and 
warn them of the dangers of relying too much on China.  She called 
on the U.S. to continue to abide by its commitments under the Taiwan 
Relations Act and implored the U.S. not to "give up" a democratic 
Taiwan. 
 
Kaohsiung City Government: U.S. Beef OK 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Responding to the Director's defense of U.S. beef, Mayor 
Chen mentioned that she had taken a low-key approach in Kaohsiung, 
requesting only that local supermarkets clearly mark the country of 
origin of beef on sale.  Unlike Taipei City, she pointed out, 
Kaohsiung had no problem with U.S. beef as long as it met Taiwan's 
quality standards.  Reiterating her personal opinion that U.S. beef 
was "reliable," Chen insisted that the DPP did not want to undermine 
U.S.-Taiwan relations over beef.  The DPP's main concern, she 
explained, was the Executive Yuan's non-transparent handling of the 
issue and its unclear explanations to the public, which caused fear 
among Taiwan's people. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Mayor Chen's remarks on Taiwan's democracy and President 
Ma's cross-Strait policies are a familiar refrain in DPP circles. 
In the run up to Kaohsiung's key 2010 Mayoral election, she will 
likely tack to shore up and energize her support among the city's 
deep-Green DPP faithful, who have expressed doubts about her 
commitment to their cause.  Mayor Chen's ability to consolidate her 
base in the city is essential, as she now faces a tough primary 
challenge from popular DPP Kaohsiung County Magistrate Yang 
Chiu-hsing, who announced his candidacy for Mayor earlier this 
month.  While the two candidates have been cordial on the surface, 
the mudslinging has already begun, with Yang denying a slew of 
rumors allegedly floated by Chen's camp and DPP heavyweights, 
including former DPP Presidential candidate Frank Hsieh, imploring 
the two to lead "dignified" campaigns. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Meanwhile, Mayor Chen's appeal as a DPP campaigner 
throughout the island in this year's local elections has led many of 
our DPP contacts to speculate that if Chen secures her reelection in 
2010, she will run for President in 2012.  One of Mayor Chen's 
closest advisors suggested as much, telling the Director after the 
meeting that Mayor Chen was interested in playing a "national role" 
in Taiwan in the future.
