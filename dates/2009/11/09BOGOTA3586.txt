SUBJECT: Colombia Shares Lessons from Demobilizing over 51,000 
 
Summary 
 
------- 
 
 
 
¶1.  President Uribe and Frank Pearl, High Presidential Commissioner 
for Reintegration and High Commissioner for Peace, launched a 
document based on Colombia's experience in disarmament, 
demobilization and reintegration (DDR) on November 3.  The GOC 
initiative seeks to share with other nations in conflict lessons 
learned from Colombia's seven years and 51,000 participants in DDR. 
The GOC has already engaged Haiti, Brazil and the Philippines.  The 
document was based on the First International Congress on 
Disarmament, Demobilization and Reintegration (CIDDR) held in 
Cartagena May 4-6.  End Summary. 
 
 
 
Congress on Disarmament, 
 
Demobilization & Reintegration 
 
------------------------------ 
 
 
 
¶2.  On November 3, President Uribe and Commissioner Frank Pearl 
presented a document produced from the CIDDR that was held in 
Cartagena on May 4-6 and attended by 1,400 delegates from 40 
countries.  CIDDR Director Nat Colletta, founding manager of the 
World Bank's post-conflict unit, said that the CIDDR was not 
prompted by the international community but inspired by 
Commissioner Pearl and the GOC.  Pearl recognized that Colombia had 
significant experiences and knowledge to share with nations in 
post-conflict after Colombia's seven years and over 51,000 
participants in the DDR process.  The Swedish Ambassador told the 
audience that Colombia, through CIDDR, is demonstrating how it has 
become a partner in the international community.  The document 
entitled "The Cartagena Contribution to DDR" is available at 
cartagenaddr.org. 
 
 
 
Colombia Proposes Solutions and Not Problems 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶3.  Commissioner Pearl said that Colombia was proud to present its 
contribution to the world and added, "for the first time, Colombia 
proposes solutions and not problems."  He said that reintegration 
was the key to DDR and to sustainable peace, and is changing the 
"essence and face" of Colombia.  Pearl emphasized that there is no 
magic formula, but working with victims and communities is 
essential along with interagency cooperation and committed 
investment.  Colombia does not pretend to have all the answers and 
still has a lot to learn, but the GOC felt strongly that other 
countries struggling with armed conflict should benefit from the 
lessons of both Colombia's successes and its failures. 
 
 
 
GOC Sharing, More Than Just Words 
 
--------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶4.  The GOC recently provided reintegration training to Haiti as 
part of the UN Peacekeeping team and sponsored two "study tours" 
for international DDR practitioners who came to Colombia for 
two-week field-based workshops visiting reintegration centers and 
productive, education and counseling activities with the 
demobilized and GOC staff around the country.  Commissioner Pearl 
went to Brazil on November 9 to discuss technical cooperation 
--most likely bilateral exchange visits.  Later this month, he will 
lead a team to the Philippines (at their request) to share 
experiences and provide training. 
 
 
 
Uribe: 'Democratic Security' Much More than Security 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
 
 
¶5.  President Uribe said that reintegration was a key component of 
his Democratic Security policy.  Uribe stressed that physical 
security for citizens was only the first step in the policy which 
includes advancing political and individual liberties, human 
rights, reconciliation, reparations for victims, and economic 
prosperity.  Uribe remarked earlier this year at the CIDDR, "for us 
the end goal of the Reintegration Policy is not a cemetery or a 
prison...  it is peace." 
 
 
 
Three Broad Lessons 
 
------------------- 
 
 
 
¶6.  Colletta said the CIDDR involved DDR implementers, 
beneficiaries and practitioners who had first-hand experience. 
Colletta identified three broad lessons.  First, context matters 
and DDR programs are not universally applicable.  Contextual 
factors include the economy, the local community and the state's 
capacity and legitimacy.  Second, DDR is a long-term transformative 
process that requires long-term investment and commitment.  Third, 
reintegration requires a holistic approach where labels of victim 
and victimizer should be avoided. 
 
 
 
Colombian DDR in Numbers 
 
------------------------ 
 
 
 
¶7.  According to GOC statistics, between August 2002 and April 
2009, over 51,000 individuals demobilized.  This includes over 
35,353 paramilitary, 12,075 Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia 
(FARC), and 2,551 National Liberation Army (ELN) members.  The GOC 
estimates there are currently ten individual demobilizations per 
day where a member of an illegal armed group escapes and presents 
him/herself before a civil or military authority.  The current rate 
of return to criminal activity is 7%.
