¶1. (U) This is an action request for Embassy Berlin. 
 
¶2. (SBU) State thanks post for delivering reftel B points to 
German MFA desk officer Dr. Bernd Rinnert. In response to his 
inquiries (reftel A), State requests that Post offer the 
following explanation about how the Global Initiative to 
Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) fits into the G-20: 
 
-- The GICNT is a capacity-building and information-sharing 
initiative that holds no official or unofficial role in the 
G-8 or in the G-20. GICNT goals include: 
 
        - Bringing together experience and expertise from the 
nonproliferation, counterproliferation, and counter-terrorism 
disciplines. 
        - Integrating collective capabilities and resources 
to strengthen the overall global architecture to combat 
nuclear terrorism. 
        - Providing the opportunity for nations to share 
information and expertise in a legally non-binding 
environment. 
 
-- The non-proliferation and counter-terrorism work done in 
other organizations and initiatives such as the G-8 Global 
Partnership, the G-9 Lyon Roma Group, and the G-8 
Counterterrorism Action Group (CTAG) reinforces the goals of 
the GICNT but does not undermine GICNT's capacity-building 
activities. The fact that G-20 member states have designated 
the G-20 as their premier forum for international economic 
cooperation should have no effect upon GICNT activities. 
Instead, increased awareness of non-proliferation and 
counter-terrorism activities by G-20 countries who are not 
partners to the GICNT (Argentina, Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, 
and South Africa) may lead heightened interest and more 
participation by such countries.
