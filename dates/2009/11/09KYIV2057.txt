¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  After weeks of dithering, Ukraine's 
parliamentary budget committee approved hundreds of proposed 
amendments, only to see the draft 2010 budget get voted down in the 
Rada (Ukraine's parliament) on a floor vote.  This orchestrated 
maneuver, designed to further delay the review process, may ensure 
that the 2010 budget is not passed before the presidential election. 
 The Ministry of Finance has agreed to rewrite the draft budget, but 
it will not comply with a Rada resolution to tabulate increases for 
social spending.  The Party of Regions will try to prevent Prime 
Minister Tymoshenko from gaining extraordinary discretionary 
spending authority, over and above what her government would already 
possess in a continuing resolution-type scenario.  End summary. 
 
BUDGET COMMITTEE APPROVES AMENDMENTS, BUT... 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Against the expectations of senior committee members (Ref 
A), the Rada budget committee voted on November 19 to present an 
amended 2010 draft budget to the full parliament for a floor vote. 
In any typical year, this committee vote would have been a mere 
formality, necessary prior to a first reading in the parliament and 
adoption of the committee's recommendations. 
 
...THE RADA VOTES AGAINST THEIR ADOPTION 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On November 20, however, the Rada voted against the budget 
committee's proposals.  Embassy sources indicated that the procedure 
had been entirely orchestrated within the committee and on the Rada 
floor by leading factions, united (for conflicting reasons) in their 
desire to see the current draft 2010 budget fail (Ref A). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Although Tymoshenko's government drafted the budget, her 
BYuT faction is now against it for two reasons: 1) the IMF has said 
the draft budget contains an unsustainable 8% deficit, and 2) the 
lack of a budget would give Tymoshenko more control over directing 
2010 expenditures prior to the presidential election.  The 
opposition Party of Regions does not support the draft budget 
because it lacks credible macroeconomic indicators, and because it 
is a sop to Tymoshenko-backed interests. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) As a result of the Rada rejecting the draft budget, one of 
its key amendments -- a provision to bring the 2010 budget in line 
with the recently approved social standards law -- was voted down. 
Observers said this was only a "technical 'no' vote", since the 
Party of Regions continues to support implementation of the social 
standards law (Ref B), which established a revised subsistence 
minimum and will likely lead to an increase in pension allocations 
(with concomitant wage increases anticipated in 2010). 
 
BUDGET BACK TO CABINET OF MINISTERS 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The Rada also issued a resolution to send the draft 2010 
budget back to the Cabinet of Ministers for revision.  The Ministry 
of Finance now has two weeks to prepare a new draft budget.  The 
Rada resolution instructs the Cabinet of Ministers to bring the 
budget in line with the Budget Code and the law on social standards. 
  It passed with support from the Party of Regions (171 votes), Our 
Ukraine (23), Communist Party (27), and the Lytvyn Bloc (19). 
Tymoshenko's BYuT faction did not vote. 
 
CYNICAL FINANCE MINISTRY 
------------------------ 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Acting Minister of Finance Umanskiy responded by saying 
that his experts on fiscal policy would revise the budget.  The 
Ministry would comply with the Rada instruction to finalize a new 
draft within two weeks, with the caveat that the Ministry could not 
abide by the Rada resolution to bring the 2010 budget in line with 
the social spending law, which Tymoshenko and her BYuT faction have 
opposed.  Umanskiy reasoned that the Rada floor vote, striking down 
the budget committee's amendments (one of which had required 
implementation of the social standards law in the 2010 budget), had 
more legal force than the Rada resolution. 
 
2010 SPENDING: AT WHAT LEVEL? 
----------------------------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) While most analysts expect that the Tymoshenko government 
will enter 2010 without a Rada-approved budget, triggering a 
continuing resolution-type scenario, there are no clear guidelines 
for how additional or extraordinary spending allocations would be

made.  According to the Budget Code, if the 2010 budget is not 
approved, GOU expenditures should be disbursed at 2009 levels. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Tymoshenko has sought to get around restrictions on 
additional expenditures, such as for the presidential election or 
other discretionary items, through an October 29 Cabinet of 
Ministers resolution (#1181).  The resolution, which will enter into 
force if the 2010 budget is not passed, would allow the state 
treasury to fund articles not envisioned in 2009, despite the fact 
that budget watchers believe such a provision would violate the 
Budget Code. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Both the Party of Regions and President Yushchenko have 
stated that they oppose resolution 1181.  On November 18, Party of 
Regions MPs challenged the resolution in the Constitutional Court, a 
move that the IMF had told us was inevitable.  If the 2010 budget is 
not adopted, and if the October 29 resolution is struck down by the 
Constitutional Court, the GOU would need to find a new mechanism to 
finance the presidential election.  A separate law likely would be 
required to cover the projected UAH 969 million ($120 million) 
needed for election-related expenditures. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶11.  (SBU) More fiscal theatrics have not changed the bottom line: 
the Rada is unlikely to pass a 2010 budget before the presidential 
election.  After the Cabinet of Ministers makes its revisions, the 
draft budget will go again to the budget committee for new 
amendments, and finally to the full Rada for a repeat first reading. 
 The absence of a 2010 budget is seen as beneficial by all the major 
political forces, despite the possible need to pass separate 
legislation to finance the 2010 election. 
 
¶12.  (SBU) Tymoshenko's attempt to secure further control over 2010 
expenditures (beyond what she would have with a continuing 
resolution-type scenario) and boost her power to make discretionary 
payments is bold.  But, it was predictable that she would encounter 
a challenge from the Party of Regions and President Yushchenko over 
her Cabinet resolution.  The outcome of a legal ruling on Resolution 
1181 is still unclear, however.
