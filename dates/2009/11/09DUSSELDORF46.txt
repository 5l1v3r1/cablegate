MILESTONE FOR INTEGRATION 
 
REF: 07 DUSSELDORF 22 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  On November 7, the cornerstone for the 
Turkish Islamic Union's (DITIB) Cologne mosque and cultural 
center was laid in the presence of 2,000 guests, including 
senior representatives from the German and Turkish governments, 
and representatives of major religious communities   After three 
years in planning, German and Turkish representatives hailed the 
event as a victory for Cologne's citizens, especially its large 
Muslim population, mostly of Turkish origin.  The cornerstone 
laying ceremony celebrated the persistent determination of 
Cologne's city hall -- under the formidable leadership of former 
Cologne Lord Mayor Fritz Schramma --  and North-Rhine 
Westphalia's (NRW) government to work together with DITIB -- 
directly tied to Turkey's Religious Affairs Directorate 
(Diyanet) -- closely to counter  right wing extremist opposition 
to the project and promote further Muslim integration in German 
society. End summary. 
 
 
 
¶2. (U) On the German side, MFA Minister of State Werner Hoyer, 
who has his constituency in Cologne, represented the federal 
government.  Chancellor Merkel -- although not present at the 
ceremony -- embraced the mosque's planned construction as 
evidence that integration was an important value in Germany.  In 
a written statement read aloud by the organizers, Merkel said 
that the construction of Germany's largest mosque was evidence 
that people had found a home in Germany and were here to stay. 
Thomas Kufen, NRW Commissioner for Integration, said the road to 
the event had often been rocky, but all involved had jointly 
shouldered the responsibility and seen it through to the end. 
Cologne was an open, tolerant city, and the cultural center 
would be a place for dialogue and togetherness. 
 
 
 
¶3. (U) Former Cologne Lord Mayor Fritz Schramma, a supporter of 
the Turkish-Muslim community throughout the process, spoke of 
the wish, from the outset, to create a mosque and cultural 
center that was transparent, open and welcoming.  It would be, 
he declared, a house for the future of Cologne and a place for 
integration.  He echoed the words of renowned Cologne architect 
Paul Boehm, the mosque/cultural center's designer, who described 
the mosque and cultural center as a place for people who are at 
home in two worlds and two cultures.  Representatives of the 
Evangelical and Protestant churches also stressed the right of 
every religion to have a place of worship and referred to the 
"Cologne Compact for Freedom," in which all religious groups in 
Cologne have pledged to work together against hate and prejudice. 
 
 
 
¶4. (U) On behalf of the Turkish government, GOT Diyanet 
President Ali Bardakoglu described the mosque and cultural 
center not only as a success for Cologne's Muslim population, 
but for all of Cologne's citizens and all Germans.   Bardakoglou 
further noted that the mosque would help lay the foundation for 
mutual respect and set an example of religious freedom for the 
world.  He indicated that the GOT would make good on its pledge 
to return St. Paul's Church in Tarsus, Turkey to use as a church 
and a center for Christian study.   The only discordant note 
came from Turkish Minister of State Faruk Celik, who delivered a 
speech more befitting a campaign rally.  On the other hand, 
DITIB President Sadi Arslan thanked all layers of the German 
government and the public, describing the result as a clear 
"yes" to co-existence and diversity, and a clear "no" to 
segregation.  The mosque, he pledged, would be a bridge between 
yesterday and tomorrow.
