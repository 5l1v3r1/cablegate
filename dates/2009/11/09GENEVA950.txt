1.(SBU) Charge had a conversation this morning with PA Ambassador 
Khraishi on the PA's bid for observer status in the WTO.  Charge 
emphasized that the United States continues to have questions 
regarding the PA's request for observer status in the WTO General 
Council (GC) but that we are willing to sit down with them and 
discuss this issue and the criteria for WTO membership, including 
possible technical assistance, in detail.  He also reiterated that 
the United States would support observer status for the PA at the 
upcoming WTO Ministerial Conference and reminded Khraishi that for 
this to be possible the PA would have to submit a formal request for 
it by Thursday.  Finally, Charge emphasized that the PA needed to 
engage directly with Israel on these issues. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Khraishi said that his authorities have decided to request 
observer status at the MC.  However, unlike the last time, they 
don't want this to be ad hoc observer status which provides no 
security as to future MCs.  They see this as a second class status. 
With respect to the November GC, he said that the PA would like to 
have the issue on the agenda for a non-confrontational discussion 
with no expectation of a decision.  He thought that he could 
convince his allies to follow this low key path. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Charge noted that the PA's desire for their observer status 
at the MC not to be ad hoc was a new element and that he would have 
to consult with his authorities.  On the November GC, he expressed 
concern that insisting that GC observership be placed on the agenda 
would stand in the way of gaining the necessary consensus on MC 
observer status.  Khraishi seemed to take the point but said that he 
would have to consult with others. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment - Accepting the PA's request for MC observer status 
at the MC on a non-"ad hoc" basis would be different from what we 
did at the last MC, but it would not actually make observer status 
at the next MC automatic.  The standard practice for non-ad hoc 
observers is to grant them observer status at future MCs but that 
still have to be confirmed by the GC before each MC, as we just did 
in October.
