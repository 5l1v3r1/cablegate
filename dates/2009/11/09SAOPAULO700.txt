Moving the Line in Honduras 
 
Article in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (11-28) by columnist Clovis 
Rossi notes: "....So far, we have stood by, lets' say, the 'good 
people' [on the Honduran issue].  It is correct to repudiate a 
coup, it is correct to insist that the ousted President return to 
power, and it is correct to say that elections, in order to have 
legitimacy, cannot be undertaken with an illegitimate government. 
I'm the biggest fan of principles.....But to insist on them - and 
only on them - when the reality goes in another direction is merely 
to mark a stance of what is worth in the academic world, but not 
for governments......Insisting in denying the reality 
contradicts.....a series of acts and words of President Lula....The 
entire truth is that elections were not summoned by the coup 
makers; they have always been in place.  Neither were the 
candidates imposed by the coup makers.  They were already in 
place....It is time to recognize that the reality is the only 
truth."
