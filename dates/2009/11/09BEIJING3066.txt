  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. IRAQI OIL CONTRACT 
 
"The West attacks China for 'reaping without sowing'" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/06)(pg 1): "The sentiment of jealousy over 
the big order signed between Petro China Company Limited and BP 
(British Petroleum) to develop the biggest Iraqi oil field is 
spreading in the West.  The West's criticism shows they are still 
not accustomed to China's share of the world's resources.  Chinese 
experts believe that Western media's promotion of Western 
nationalism will lead to hostility towards China, which is very 
worrisome for China.  Zhao Gancheng, an expert at the Shanghai 
Research Institute of International Issues, said that in some 
Westerner's opinion, the ideal world is a dark world, except for 
Europe and the U.S.  Europe and the United States always treat 
themselves as the hosts of the world.  Chinese expert Jin Canrong 
also believes that the U.S. government hopes that China will 
participate in Afghanistan and Iraq's reconstruction.  Based on the 
West's rules, China is being a responsible country.  Those who still 
believe that the West is the center of the world should be aware of 
newly-emerging countries' increasing strength." 
 
¶2. AFRICA 
 
China helps build Africa while the West empties Africa 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(11/06)(pg 2): "The West is a little confused by 
the unprecedented economic interactions between China and Africa. 
The U.S. is mainly importing raw oil and natural gas from Africa, 
which barely help develop the infrastructure and industrial 
facilities in Africa.  However, raw oil and natural gas accounts for 
less than 20% in China-Africa trade.  The exploration of resources 
in Africa and a number of China's construction sites have helped to 
develop the local infrastructure and facilities like power plants, 
traffic controls and housing.  China's economic cooperation with 
Africa has brought Africa's rapid development.  The forthcoming 
ministerial meeting of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation on Nov. 
8th and 9th will further cooperation between China and Africa. 
Whether or not the West can understand it, and regardless of how 
hard they try, the deepening of the China-Africa relationship is 
unstoppable." 
 
¶3. AFGHANISTAN 
 
"Is the Taliban infiltrating the Afghan military police?" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(11/06)(pg 14): "The frequent revolts of the 
Afghan military police have caused the coalition troops in 
Afghanistan to doubt how many Taliban are undercover within the 
troop.  Frequent attacks have brought doubts about the decision of 
the coalition troops to withdraw from Afghanistan - which will 
enable the Afghan military police to take over Afghanistan's 
security affairs.  In many coalition soldiers' eyes, the Afghan 
military police are corrupt, take opium and are distrustful.  The 
West also suspects that, for the sake of supporting rebellions, the 
Afghan military police have given arms to the Taliban.  Meanwhile, 
the coalition troops have also had frictions with the Afghan 
security troops.  They don't trust each other.  In fact, in this 
U.S.-led war, the Afghan military police are enduring the largest 
casualties.  Their $120 a month salary is much less than the 
Taliban's bonus.  Experts say that only those who are desperate will 
submit themselves to the Afghan troops."
