SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: BRAZIL-U.S. RELATIONS 
 
Brazil, U.S. and Perceptions 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (11-26) by columnist Clovis 
Rossi: "Marco Aurelio Garcia's interview, in which he talks about 
the disappointment with Barack Obama's administration is strong, 
but is far from representing a conflict, contrary to what parts of 
the media have indicated.  It seems much more like a call for 
attention....with a [legitimate] argument, [of] Obama's negligence 
with Latin America....The request worked: Obama's National Security 
Advisor General James Jones called Marco Aurelio Garcia and 
everything became clear.....There are only differing perceptions on 
some issues.....Latin America is not a priority [for Obama] because 
it is not a problem..... But if the issue is not well managed, it 
may create a disturbance with Brazil and with a large part of Latin 
America." 
 
 
 
"Not Doing Well" 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (11-26) by columnist Eliane 
Catanhede notes: "Brazil's relations with Iran are doing pretty 
well, but we cannot say the same about Brazil's relations with the 
U.S.....The letter Obama sent to Lula seems like an inventory of 
the points of disagreement.....and things are going bad early. 
Obama has just taken over, has major domestic difficulties, has not 
obtained approval of all his nominees in Congress - not even 
ambassador to Brazil - and cannot make advances in the Middle East, 
in Afghanistan, and in the rapprochement with Latin America.  And 
the most curious thing is the imbalance of bilateral trade: US$4 
billion surplus on the part of the U.S., a 284% 
increase....wouldn't it be better if Brazilian exporters were the 
ones doing well?  The next round will be Copenhagen, with U.S. and 
China on one side; and Brazil and France on the other." 
 
 
 
A Desirable Peace 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (11-26) by President Lula's 
international affairs advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia states: "Over 
recent weeks the GOB has welcomed the leaders of Israel, the 
Palestinian National Authority and Iran.....the three leaders 
saw....in Brazilian diplomacy, especially in Lula, a possibility 
to, through dialogue, advance towards a negotiated solution for a 
conflict that transcends a regional dimension. [The conflict] 
threatens world peace....Foreign policy themes...cannot be the 
target of electoral opportunism...the dialogue that the GOB held 
with Arab and Israeli communities in our country and in Latin 
America is transparent and does not leave room for doubt about our 
stance....this crystalline transparency differs from the murky 
waters in which fishermen launch their bait, more to attract 
incautious voters than to offer alternatives."
