SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050184480 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-shipment check on license 050184480 for the export of 
three (3) International Traffic in Arms (ITAR)-controlled 
optical payloads.  Post is requested to complete this Blue 
Lantern inquiry within 45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern inquiry will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: End-Use Statement provided by foreign 
consignee/foreign end-user, Israel Aerospace Industries 
(IAI), is vague. End-use of the optical payload is described 
as "demonstrations to potential customers in Israel," 
however, no specific customers are identified.  Furthermore, 
the license application states that "the optical payload will 
be used on the (Boeing) 737 platform for military 
reconnaissance," but no military customers are identified. 
As a condition for the approval of the license, the US 
applicant was instructed to notify IAI that further 
authorization from DDTC is required for any retransfer of the 
optical payload. 
 
¶4. ACTION: Department requests that Post make inquiries with 
IAI representatives to: (1) confirm receipt of the optical 
payloads, (2) clarify how the items will be used, and (3) 
confirm whether or not IAI intends to retransfer the items to 
a different end-user. 
 
END ACTION.
