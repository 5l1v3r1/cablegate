SUBJECT: COUNCIL OF EUROPE PARLIAMENTARY ASSEMBLY DECLINES TO OBSERVE 
IRAQI NATIONAL ELECTIONS 
 
REF: STATE 114183 
 
(SBU) Mateo Sorinas, Secretary General of the Council of 
Europe's Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) informed us November 24 
that the PACE has declined the invitation to observe the Iraqi 
national elections.  Sorinas explained that the PACE observes 
elections only within Europe, with the one exception being the 
Palestinian Territories, because of PACE's "special 
relationship" with the Palestinian Authority.  We note that 
earlier one of Sorinas' assistants had advised us that PACE 
insurance does not cover travel to and inside Iraq.
