WORKING GROUP - NOVEMBER 3 UPDATE 
 
 ¶1.  (SBU) Summary: The Government of Iraq continues to 
recover from the October 25 bombing. The Ministry of Justice 
(MOJ) is preparing to move into its new quarters on November 
8 and will receive some equipment from INL. The Minister of 
Justice has appointed the DG for Administration and Finance 
to coordinate recovery efforts at the MOJ. The Higher 
Judicial Council (HJC) has resumed operations at its 
temporary site in the Al Karkh courthouse. ITAO and the U.S. 
Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) are planning a structural 
assessment of the Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works 
(MMPW), which is temporarily using its former office space. 
USACE will also do an assessment of the MOJ/HJC building next 
week. The Provincial Council (PC) and Baghdad Governorate 
have resumed partial operations in their building, with the 
PC being able to hold its general council meeting on site 
today. End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On November 2, INL in Washington approved 50 
workstation packages (valued at approximately $177,000) and 
six vehicles for the MOJ, should begin delivery on November 
¶10. This is in addition to assistance already provided to the 
HJC reported septels.The HJC has established a continuity 
cell and resumed most operations at its temporary site in the 
Al Karkh courthouse.  All items (except the vehicles) will be 
initially conveyed under a loan agreement and converted into 
a grant after completion of delivery.  Deputy Minister of 
Justice Posho expressed his appreciation of this assistance. 
The MOJ has signed for occupancy at the new location for its 
headquarters--the former Iraqi National Council Building 
(INCB)--and hopes to move in on November 8. The Minister of 
Justice has appointed the Deputy Minister of Justice and DG 
for Administration and Finance to coordinate recovery efforts 
at the MOJ. Over 100 MOJ staff are picking up the pieces this 
week to salvage files and equipment. MOJ has also hired a 
contractor to clean and repair the INCB, which was damaged 
during the August 19 bombing due to its proximity to the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. MOJ has relayed a need for metal 
detectors, x-ray machines, and a closed circuit camera system 
for the INCB. USACE will conduct an assessment of the MOJ/HJC 
building next week. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Some staff in the MMPW have reported back to work 
in the old Mansour compound building, but the MMPW still 
needs furniture and equipment. ITAO and the USACE are 
planning a structural assessment of the MMPW. MMPW provided 
us with a list of priority items needed for basic operations. 
 USAID is currently conducting an inventory of available 
excess property including furniture, IT equipment, computers 
and vehicles; we are also considering use of QRF funds to 
respond to this request. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) None of the PC and Governorate leadership were 
significantly injured. PC and Governorate staff have 
reoccupied most of the building following an initial 
assessment by the USACE that there was no critical structural 
damage. The PC Chairman told us he resumed operations in the 
building on November 1. We have not received any formal 
request for assistance, but PC officials have informally 
indicated that vehicles would be needed. PC members had 
temporarily relocated to various local councils and held its 
first general council meeting on October 27 in a rented hall 
in Zawra Park.  It was able to hold its second meeting on 
November 3 in the PC Building. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Post will continue to report as information becomes 
available on assistance requests for immediate needs from the 
GOI and coordinate our interagency responses, along with 
QGOI and coordinate our interagency responses, along with 
those of the international community.  We will also continue 
long-term capacity building programs and engagements with the 
entities affected.
