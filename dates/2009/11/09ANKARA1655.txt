¶1. (SBU) Yonca Ozceri, head of the Human Rights Department at 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told us November 17 that 
Turkey would "act in the way it acted in previous years" on 
the UNGA Third Committee resolution on Iran.  (Note: It chose 
to be absent during the 2008 vote. End Note).  He said that 
Turkey is a co-sponsor of the Burma and DPRK resolutions, and 
will thus provide support for them.  Ozceri indicated that 
Turkey's position had not changed since receiving the 
information in REF B.
