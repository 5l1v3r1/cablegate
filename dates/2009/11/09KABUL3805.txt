SUBJECT: AFGHAN ATTORNEY GENERAL WANTS TO MOVE AGAINST 
         CORRUPTION; SEEKS USG SUPPORT 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: Afghan Attorney General Aloko expressed his 
desire to fight corruption and thanked the U.S. for its support for 
Afghan law enforcement efforts in a November 28 meeting.  He asked 
for U.S. "political support" if he indicts an Afghan minister. 
Coordinating Director Wayne assured Aloko that the USG would 
continue to support the AG's efforts to enforce Afghan laws and 
fight corruption which are top US priorities.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On November 28, Justice Attach and Coordinating Director 
for Development and Economic Affairs Wayne met with Afghan Attorney 
General Aloko to discuss ongoing and future anti-corruption 
investigations in light of President Karzai's Inaugural commitment 
to end a "climate of impunity."  Aloko described ongoing efforts to 
demonstrate the seriousness of work done by his office.  He praised 
the recent conviction resulting in a 20-year sentence in the Shaheen 
case, a narcotics case tried at the Counter Narcotics Justice 
Center.  He also praised DOJ and DEA support for Afghan 
investigation and prosecution efforts that made this and other 
convictions possible.  He described other investigations underway to 
explain the scope of crimes under investigation and the complicated 
nature of gathering appropriate evidence.  He noted he is sending 
teams of investigators to various provinces (Uruzgan, Helmand, 
Bahglan and Jalalabad) to investigate reports of corruption. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Attorney General Aloko expressed appreciation for U.S. 
support for the development of the Major Crimes Task Force, which is 
led by the Ministry of Interior (MOI) and the National Directorate 
of Security (NDS).  He noted U.S. support provides valuable 
assistance to his prosecutors.  He also expressed appreciation for 
DOJ mentoring of his Anti-Corruption Unit (ACU).  Ambassador Wayne 
said the Department of State was providing additional funds for DOJ 
attorneys to use in mentoring the unit and that additional DOJ 
prosecutors would be arriving in the months ahead to support the 
ACU.  Aloko recounted a conversation he had with the Supreme Court 
Chief Justice Abdul Salam Azimi.  Chief Justice Azimi said he would 
pay special attention to anti-corruption cases and the judges he 
designated to preside over them.  He had urged Aloko to notify the 
Supreme Court Chief Justice if he believes the judges are 
inappropriately handling cases.  Chief Justice Azimi said such 
judges would be dismissed, according to the AG. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Aloko said that following the inauguration, he and several 
of his prosecutors met with the two Vice Presidents to convey 
congratulations.  He told them he was making anti-corruption a 
priority for his office.  He asked them to support the AGs office. 
According to Aloko, Second Vice President Halili pledged his 
support. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The AG said his prosecutors face major hurdles in getting 
to provinces to investigate cases of corruption.  He asked the U.S. 
to help by providing helicopter transportation for the AGs office. 
He asked the U.S. to continue to work with him and others who want 
change for the good.  The U.S., he said, has offered more help than 
other donors to strengthen the rule of law. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Justice Attach said DOJ mentors were willing to meet with 
the AG's attorneys to review evidence packages developed for 
sensitive corruption cases to ensure they were well-developed before 
going to court.  The AG expressed appreciation, and said his major 
challenge is what to do if evidence points to a minister.  He will 
be under intense pressure if he indicts a minister, and therefore 
will need "political support" of the U.S. Embassy.  Ambassador Wayne 
assured the AG that the U.S. will provide political support to 
enforce Afghan law and fight corruption.  He cited President Obama, 
Secretary Clinton and other senior officials who have made clear 
that fighting corruption is a top U.S. priority in Afghanistan. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) COMMENT: The AG's readiness to pursue investigations and 
prosecutions of corrupt officials, including ministers is welcome. 
However, he is likely to face intense pressure and political 
interference if he does so.  Moreover, it is not clear whether Aloko 
will be reappointed AG in the new cabinet.  We will continue to 
support the law enforcement efforts of AG Aloko, or his replacement 
and other key Afghan officials, by providing political cover, 
technical assistance, mentoring, and financial support.
