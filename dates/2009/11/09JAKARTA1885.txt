Background and Fact Finding 
--------------------------- 
 
¶2.  On the morning of Wednesday 04 November 2009, Econoff visited 
the offices of Pt. Iroda Mitra (Iroda) located on the 11th floor of 
the Menara Sudirman building in central Jakarta.  Iroda was located 
in a large modern office building and their presence there was 
clearly marked.  In setting up the appointment, Econoff was easily 
able to contact Iroda and 
speak with an individual who clealy identified herself as a 
representative of the company.  Setting up a meeting date at the 
Iroda office was transparent and easy. 
 
¶3.  Econoff spoke for approximately 60 minutes with Iroda President 
Commisioner, Hans Maramis.  Mr. Maramis was friendly, engaging and 
thorough in discussing varying aspects of the Iroda business 
functions.  Econoff learned that Iroda currently provides services 
related to the launching of telecommunications satellites in 
Indonesia.  To date, Iroda has provided essential equipment to five 
separate launchings in Indonesia.  Iroda currently only represents 
one US company, Loral.  Mr. Maramis believes that Loral offers the 
best satellite space system product on the market and is attempting 
to get their total electronic systems into subsequent Indonesian 
satellites.  Mr. Maramis noted that Loral's prices were considerably 
higher than his Russian and Chinese competition.  Additionally, due 
to increasing reliance on the "e-auction" method to solicit prices 
from competing entities, Loral had recently pulled out of the 
bidding process in Indonesia.  As a rule, Loral does not participate 
in online "e-auction" bidding competitions. 
 
¶4.  Iroda was established circa 1994 and currently has approximately 
300 employees.  In addition to Iroda, Mr. Maramis also acts as 
director for Mortar Utama and Primacon, both related to the 
construction industry in Indonesia. 
 
¶5.  Econoff is unaware of any derogatory background information on 
Iroda.  Econoff highlighted to Mr. Maramis the important position 
that he occupies as a named and authorized representative of USML 
products and urged him to always comply with regulations which 
regulated businesses such as his, and primarily with regards to end 
user information.  Mr. Maramis stated that he understood the 
importance of this issue and that he was never to re-transfer or 
re-export and piece of equipment not strictly authorized for this 
purpose.
