On November 3, PolOffs presented reftel demarche to MFA 
Director General for Foreign Policy, Joaquin Maza.  Maza said 
 
he believes "sanctions against Israel don't help the 
situation," but told us he had to review the resolution's 
text and consult with FM Hugo Martinez before stating an 
official GOES position.  Martinez is currently in Jamaica 
attending a Rio Group conference.  Maza also mentioned that 
he discussed the same issue with Israeli Ambassador Mattanya 
Cohen just prior to our meeting.  We will report any further 
information on the GOES position septel.
