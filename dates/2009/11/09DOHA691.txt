(C) KEY POINTS 
-------------- 
 
-- Ambassador met November 24 with Qatar Investment Authority 
(QIA) Executive Board Member Dr. Hussain Al-Abdulla to 
discuss QIA's future investment strategy. 
 
-- Dr. Al-Abdulla said that the QIA has developed a 2010 
investment strategy that will focus on three areas:  acquire 
distressed businesses that have cash flow problems but are 
otherwise healthy; invest in a broad range of commodities; 
and purchase, in the second half of CY 2010, commercial real 
estate in prime locations, principally in the United States 
and Europe. 
 
-- He said that the QIA was also investing in joint ventures 
with agricultural companies in Argentina and Brazil. 
 
-- QIA will not invest with hedge funds or private equity 
companies in 2010, Al-Abdulla said, though this policy will 
be reviewed in 2011. 
 
End Key Points. 
 
¶1. (C) At a November 24 meeting with Ambassador, Qatar 
Investment Authority (QIA) Executive Board Member Dr. Hussain 
Al-Abdulla outlined Qatar's investment strategy for 2010. 
Also present at the meeting were FCS Chief Le and Poloff 
Caudill.  In response to Ambassador Dr. Al-Abdulla said that 
for the first half of 2009, the QIA strategy was "to do 
nothing", but after analyzing current global economic 
conditions, it has developed a plan for the coming year.  The 
strategy will focus on three sectors. 
 
¶2. (C) The first area of the QIA's investment efforts will be 
the commodities sector.  Ambassador asked Al-Abdulla if he 
could be more specific, to which he replied that the QIA is 
interested in all types of commodities - oil, gas, gold, 
silver, and agricultural products.  He shared his view that a 
structural change is underway in the commodities sector, 
strongly suggesting long-term price increases.  The growth in 
the middle class of emerging countries such as China and 
India, for example, suggests higher food prices over the long 
term. 
 
¶3. (C) Dr. Al-Abdulla also pointed to the weakness of the 
dollar as a factor guiding its investment strategy.  The QIA 
predicts that the dollar will continue weakening.  Even if 
there is near-term economic growth in the U.S., he said, it 
would raise the specter of inflation, weakening the dollar 
further.  All this strongly suggested investments in 
commodities, including precious metals. 
 
¶4. (C) In 2010 the QIA will also focus on business 
acquisition.  It will seek to acquire businesses with good 
management and good products, but which have cash flow 
problems.  "We are not interested in distressed assets or 
distressed debt.  We are interested in distressed sellers", 
Al-Abdulla said. 
 
¶5. (C) The third part of the QIA's investment strategy will 
be in the real estate sector.  Al-Abdulla said that the QIA 
has not yet begun investing heavily in real estate assets, 
because it believes that prices will go lower through the 
first half of 2010. 
 
¶6. (C) Ambassador asked Dr. Al-Abdulla to go into more detail 
concerning the types of real estate assets the QIA was 
looking to acquire, and in what areas of the world. 
Al-Abdulla explained that the QIA was looking for prime 
commercial real estate, and expects QIA's best opportunities 
to be in the U.S. and Europe.  He observed that East Asia 
real estate has become too expensive; there are no bargains 
there.  He noted, however, that the QIA was in search of 
value, and that price alone would not be the determining 
factor in its investment decisions. 
 
¶7. (C) In discussing Asian economic growth, he noted with 
approval China's ability to quickly make major spending 
decisions, particularly related to large scale 
infrastructure, contrasting it to the slowness he saw in the 
USG's release of stimulus monies.  He predicted long term 
economic problems for the U.S. and Europe, which he believes 
are spending too much capital supporting big banks and big 
businesses and not enough to help save all the small

businesses in deep trouble. 
 
¶8. (C) Ambassador asked whether the QIA intended to invest in 
real estate in other regions outside the U.S. and Europe. 
Dr. Al-Abdulla replied that it was starting to invest in 
Brazil and Argentina, particularly in the agriculture sector. 
 He said that QIA was also working with some agribusinesses 
in the U.S. 
 
¶9. (C) Ambassador observed that Qatar has a number of 
agencies making investments both domestically and abroad, and 
asked Dr. Al-Abdulla to clarify their respective roles. 
Al-Abdulla gave the example of Qatari Diar, which he said is 
completely owned by QIA.  While QIA itself focuses on 
investment in established enterprises, Diar focuses on 
development projects.  He also pointed to groups such as 
Barwa and the National Hotel Corporation, which are now also 
owned by QIA but which will eventually be privatized. 
 
¶10. (C) When asked by the Ambassador whether hedge funds and 
private equity groups would continue to have a role in the 
QIA investment plan, Al-Abdulla replied that the QIA would 
not invest in them at all during 2010.  He said, however, 
that QIA would reconsider this position in 2011.  He added 
that QIA considers the leverage buyout an obsolete business 
model.
