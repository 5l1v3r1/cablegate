Italian, became President of the Pontifical Council on Social 
Communications in 2007.  The Council provides guidance on

entertainment.  Previously, Archbishop Celli was the Vatican's 
Under-secretary for Relations with States (deputy foreign

between the Holy See and Israel.  Since 1995 he has been 
involved in diplomatic efforts to improve the situation of the 
Church in Vietnam.  Celli has also traveled to China for

appointed to the Council for Social Communications, Celli headed 
the Vatican office that manages the financial assets of the Holy 
See.
