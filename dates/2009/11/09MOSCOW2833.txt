PETERSBURG, RUSSIA, LICENSE NO. D421291 
 
REFTEL: REQUEST #6110040; DATED 24/09/2009 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a pre-license check to determine the legitimacy 
and reliability of the end-user, Laser Systems Ltd., Saint 
Petersburg, Russia.  The organization is listed on BIS license 
application D421291 as the ultimate consignee of one ADS6144 14-BIT 
analog/digital converter with a sampling frequency of 105MSPS. This 
item is controlled for national security, missile technology, 
nuclear nonproliferation and anti-terrorism reasons under ECCN 
3A001.  The licensee is Texas Instruments, 7800 Banner Drive, M/S 
3935, Dallas, TX 75251. 
 
¶3. On November 16, 2009, Commercial Attach Katja Kravetsky and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested pre-license check at the 
offices of Laser Systems Ltd., 1, 1-ya Krasnoarmeyskaya Street, 
Saint Petersburg, Russia. The export control team met with Alexey 
Boreysho, General Director, Dmitry Vasilyev, Technical Director and 
Oleg Smirnov, Head of Electronic Systems Department. 
 
¶4. Laser Systems, Ltd. was founded in 1990 as a manufacturer of 
equipment using laser technologies.  It is a privately held limited 
liability company and has a staff of 120 employees, the majority 
engineers.  Laser Systems is currently working on a prototype for 
the QAlcolaser,Q which it developed to detect alcohol vapors inside 
a moving car.  The analog/digital converter is a component of the 
Alcolaser.  According to the company officials, the current 
prototype, which the export control team viewed, already includes a 
converter not subject to export control regulations, but it does not 
deliver sufficiently precise results. Laser Systems intends 
initially to purchase 10 converters at a unit price of approximately 
USD 50.  The export control team found that Laser Systems, Ltd. has 
a legitimate need and a legitimate end use for the reftel commodity. 
 
¶5. Recommendations: Post recommends Laser Systems Ltd., Saint 
Petersburg, Russia, as a reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. origin 
commodities.
