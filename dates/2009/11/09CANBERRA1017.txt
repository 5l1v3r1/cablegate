SUBJECT: AND THE LIST GOES ON, U.S. SECURITY DIALOGUES WITH 
AUSTRALIA 
 
REF: SECSTATE 112900 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: The United States has a wide range of 
ongoing security dialogues with Australia that date back 
decades.  There are several large, formalized dialogues that 
take place throughout the year and a virtually endless number 
of smaller working groups and direct military to military 
talks.  The main dialogues are the annual AUSMIN meetings and 
the Trilateral Security Dialogue with Australia and Japan. 
END SUMMARY 
 
AUSMIN 
------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Australia-United States Ministerial Consultations 
(AUSMIN) is the largest of security dialogue between 
Australia and the United States.  It is formalized under the 
1951 ANZUS treaty and takes place annually except for 
occasional election years when the talks are delayed.  AUSMIN 
is held at the cabinet level and is often attended by the 
Secretary of State, Defense, or both.  Feeding into AUSMIN 
are three sub-meetings chaired at the undersecretary level. 
These include MilReps military to military talks, the AUSMIN 
Defense Acquisition Committee, and informally the bilateral 
Pol-Mil Talks, each of which takes place more or less 
annually.  The next AUSMIN meeting will take place in Sydney 
in mid-January. 
 
Trilateral Security Dialogue 
---------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The United States also regularly engages in a 
series of trilateral talks with Australia and Japan which are 
collectively called the Trilateral Security Dialogue (TSD). 
The TSD is composed of 7 sub meetings that cover a specific 
topic.  Pacific Issues, South East Asian Issues, Missile 
Defense and Humanitarian Assistance are all covered during 
one of the annual sub-meetings.  There is also an annual 
meeting of senior officials from the three countries and last 
April the parties agreed in principal to an annual leaders' 
meeting, although this has yet to be scheduled.   The annual 
Security and Defense Cooperation Forum (SDCF)  grew out of 
the TSD, but has now been meeting separately from it.  The 
TSD was initially more ad hoc in nature, but last April the 
three parties agreed to terms of reference to formalize the 
talks.  TSD talks take place with some regularity throughout 
the year. 
 
A Broad Range of Other Meetings 
------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The Australian and U.S. military work very closely 
together and have a broad range of security dialogues that 
stretch from the strategic to the operational level.  The 
highest level talks are the MilReps, which as mentioned above 
feed into AUSMIN and are held between the Australian Chief of 
Defence Forces and the Commander of PACOM.  In addition to 
the military talks that take place under AUSMIN and the TSD, 
there are also annual talks between the Deputy Service Chiefs 
of Service of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines and their 
Australian counterparts.  Other dialogues focus exclusively 
on strategy, Pacific defense issues, and a variety of other 
regions and topics.  The U.S. and Australia are also both 
party to a number of multilateral defense talks. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) In addition to the military meetings, there are 
also a variety of civilian dialogues on security related 
issues.  The Policy Planning Staff for the State Department 
and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade 
also meet on an annual basis.  There are also informal 
meetings and talks between many U.S. agencies and their 
Australian counterparts, although most of these talks are not 
codified under any agreement. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) COMMENT: The alliance between Australia and the 
United States has been extremely productive and the robust 
QUnited States has been extremely productive and the robust 
exchange of ideas and information is one of its defining 
features.   Australian forces in Afghanistan have been 
praised for their interoperability with the United States and 
this would be impossible without the exchange of ideas 
fostered by these security dialogues.   The exchanges in most 
of the meetings mentioned above are meaningful and neither 
side is afraid of a frank discussion of tough issues.  END 
COMMENT.
