REF: RIO DE JANEIRO 346

FARC ARMS TRAFFICKING PIPELINE TO RIO DE JANEIRO? 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) On October 22, Federal Highway Police Officers in Mato 
Grosso seized seven weapons, including five high caliber rifles 
(7.62mm), the same type police suspect brought down a military 
police helicopter in Rio de Janeiro on October 17 (reftel).  Press 
reports allege the weapons originated from the Revolutionary Armed 
Forces of Colombia (FARC) and were destined for Rio de Janeiro, 
stating the weapons seized are widely used among FARC guerrillas 
and citing connections between imprisoned Rio de Janeiro drug 
kingpin Fernandinho Beira-Mar and the FARC.  Rubem Cesar Fernandes, 
the executive director of an NGO (Viva Rio) that implements small 
arms control programs in Rio de Janeiro told us on October 26 he 
doubted an arms trafficking connection between the FARC and 
Rio-based drug gangs, however.  "The FARC is more interested in 
selling drugs to Rio," he said. 
 
 
 
HIGH LEVEL NONPROLIFERATION EVENTS IN RIO DE JANEIRO 
 
 
 
¶3. (U) On October 29 and 30, the Brazilian Center for International 
Relations (CEBRI) and the NPSGlobal Foundation co-hosted an 
international seminar in Rio de Janeiro on "Non-Proliferation and 
Nuclear Disarmament:  The Future of the NPT."  During the forum, 
diplomats, NGO representatives, academics, and officials from the 
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) discussed ways to 
strengthen the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), ahead of the May 
2010 NPT Review meeting in New York.  The U.S. Embassy, with 
Consulate Rio support, helped sponsor the event.   Ambassador Susan 
Burk, President Obama's Special Representative for Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation, provided the closing keynote address. 
 
 
 
¶4. (U) The Missile Technology Control Regime's (MTCR) Plenary will

VALE CONTINUES EFFORTS TO OBTAIN EX-IM FINANCING FOR I.T. 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) On October 26, U.S. Export Import Bank (Ex-Im) officials 
and Rio FCS Officer met with Vale's CFO Gulherme Cavalcante and CIO 
Marco Antonio Franca, as part of ongoing efforts between Vale and 
Ex-Im Bank to conclude a substantial long-term line of credit. 
Vale is specifically interested in obtaining 2 billion USD in Ex-Im 
financing for Information Technology (IT) service contracts, which 
could allow Vale to avoid MARAD obligations requiring foreign 
purchasers to use U.S. cargo carriers to ship exports exceeding 20 
million USD.  Following a meeting with Ex-Im project and finance 
officials in Washington on October 20, Vale developed a proposal to 
contract 1 billion USD in services from HP and 1 billion USD from 
another service provider to be determined this week. (Note: out of 
 
RIO DE JAN 00000364  002 OF 002 
 
 
three bidders, two are reportedly American companies.)  Ex-Im 
officials noted the bank traditionally funds capital goods, rather 
than services, and would have to evaluate Vale's proposal further. 
Ex-Im Bank also expressed concerns whether it could legally finance 
the monthly payment scheme Vale is proposing for its IT service 
contracts.  Vale agreed to adjust its request for financing and 
follow up with Ex-Im IT Managers in Washington.
