REPORT 
 
REF: STATE 112828 
 
¶1.  (SBU) In response to our November 3 demarche, MFA Human Rights 
Directorate First Secretary Vladan Lazovic informed Poloff on 
November 4 that Serbia likely will support an emerging Egypt-led 
draft resolution on the Goldstone Report in the UN General Assembly 
(reftel) . 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Expressing hope that this resolution, which he believed 
to be the result of discussions between Egypt and the European 
Union, would "be more balanced" than the UN Human Rights Council 
resolution passed in October, Lazovic emphasized that the EU had 
passed the Egyptian resolution directly to the Serbian delegation. 
 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Lazovic indicated that Serbia, which intends to ensure 
that its voting pattern "overlaps" to a greater degree with the EU 
as it moves toward eventual candidacy, was therefore inclined to 
support the resolution, although its delegation will make a final 
decision based on the November 4 discussions in New York.
