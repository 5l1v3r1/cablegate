Â¶1. (U) Poloff delivered reftel demarche on 3 November to 
Vesna Vukovic, head of the MFA's UN office. She expressed her 
appreciation for receiving the material and indicated that 
Croatia would coordinate its position with the US via its 
mission in New York.  She noted that Croatia shares the US 
position that the Goldstone Report is best handled outside of 
the Security Council.  Additionally, she noted that Croatia 
was also concerned that some unhelpful elements would be 
included in a General Assembly resolution.  Poloff underlined 
US concern that any action taken in the UN not jepordize 
efforts to re-launch the peace process.  Vukovic understood 
the US position and indicated she would pass along our points 
and concerns to the Croatian mission in New York.  Post will 
convey any further substantive response septel.
