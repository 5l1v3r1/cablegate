SUBJECT: MERIDA INITIATIVE - CENTRAL AMERICA - ARRIVAL OF 
ATF REGIONAL FIREARMS ADVISOR IN SAN SALVADOR 
 
¶1. This cable announces the arrival of the Merida Initiative 
- Central America funded Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms 
and Explosives (ATF) Regional Firearms Advisor (RFA), 
Supervisory Special Agent Mark Jones, in San Salvador, El 
Salvador. 
 
¶2. SCOPE OF RESPONSIBILITIES: Under the Merida Initiative, 
the RFA will support the U.S. Government's efforts to enhance 
the capacity of the seven governments of the Central American 
region to combat arms trafficking and encourage the marking 
and tracing of all firearms manufactured, imported, 
confiscated or seized in the region. The RFA will also 
support USG anti-trafficking programs in the region; promote 
U.S. programs that seek to focus Central American states in 
their efforts on identifying and curbing the sources and 
methods of the illicit trade through the tracing of firearms 
used in crimes; enhance national and regional law enforcement 
cooperation; manage assistance to police and other justice 
sector entities involved in reducing firearms crime and 
violence; and, in coordination with other international and 
USG agencies, support the expeditious destruction of excess 
stocks and safeguard legitimate stocks from theft or illegal 
transfer. 
 
Specific tasks that will be carried out by the RFA include: 
 
¶A. The RFA, supplemented by TDY ATF staff, will conduct 
firearms assessments in each host nation to determine the 
firearms trafficking threat in Central America; will assess 
the effectiveness of existing host nation laws regarding the 
marking and tracing of firearms, as well as laws aimed to 
reducing the threat of the trafficking of firearms to, 
through or within each nation. The RFA will also assess host 
nation law enforcement firearms forensic capabilities. 
 
¶B. Providing training and technical assistance based upon the 
findings of the national assessments, on an individual 
country and regional basis. The regional advisor will also 
train customs, police and court officials in firearms 
investigative, tracing and forensic techniques based upon the 
results of the national firearms legislative and capacity 
assessments. 
 
¶C. Providing technical assistance to appropriate ranking law 
enforcement and other justice sector officials to develop a 
long-term strategy to strengthen anti-trafficking activities. 
 
¶D. In conjunction with host country and other USG 
organizations, will evaluate the most effective way to 
increase the availability of information on illicit 
trafficking and traffickers. This will include tools such as 
the use of eTrace and ballistic identification technologies, 
as well as the analysis of recovered firearms and ammunition. 
The goal will be to increase regional and U.S. access to 
accurate information. 
 
¶E. Will Provide advice and assistance in the preparation of 
documentation for the 
procurement of technical services, training and commodities 
and the monitoring of procurement actions, including drafting 
source-origin waivers, bid solicitations, scopes of work, and 
delivery and acceptance of items procured. This includes 
equipment, including hardware and software, needed to 
facilitate information sharing, such as eTrace access. 
 
¶F. Implement anti-trafficking prevention activities, ensuring 
that law enforcement and prevention activities are part of an 
integral program.

¶4. HOW TO UTILIZE THE RFA - REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE: We 
encourage Posts to contact the RFA directly to identify areas 
in which the RFA can add value to Post and host nation law 
enforcement efforts to reduce firearms trafficking to, 
through and within your country, as well as the strengthening 
of host nation firearms legislation and the enhancement of 
national firearms investigative, forensics and tracking 
capabilities. The RFA will prioritize requests for 
assistance, and will coordinate with the other agencies (e.g. 
FBI, DEA, U.S. ICE), including the Department, for requests 
for assistance that require the involvement of other agencies 
to fulfill a Post/host nation request. The expenses for the 
RFA are centrally funded from Washington, and travel and per 
diem costs incurred by the RFA in support of regional 
firearms interdiction training and technical assistance to 
host nation law enforcement personnel will not be charged to 
Posts. 
 
¶5. RFA OVERSIGHT AND MANAGEMENT: The RFA reports to ATF's 
Office of International Affairs. Department of State program 
management of the ATF Advisor falls under the Bureau of 
International Security and Non-Proliferation - EXBS (POC: 
Nils Johanson - FY 2008 Supplemental NADR funds) and the 
Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs 
(POC: Matt Steinhelfer - FY 2009 Omnibus INCLE funds). The 
RFA is required to seek Country Clearance for all travel to 
CEN countries, and will inform Posts in advance of projected 
in-country activities in support of Merida Initiative 
firearms trafficking and interdiction assistance activities. 
 
¶6. WHA asks that Posts support the RFA in any way that they 
can, including providing Public Affairs and logistics 
support, and that upon the RFA's first visit to a CEN Post, 
that the RFA be provided the opportunity to brief the entire 
Country Team and Law Enforcement/Merida Working Group on the 
assistance that he can bring to bear in each CEN country.
