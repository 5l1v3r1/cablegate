REF: SECSTATE 99610 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: We visited Pegasus Defense Company on 
October 21 to meet with its managing director, Ismail Turgut, 
and a number of the company,s principal officers.  Based on 
the site visit, the information provided by the company and a 
name check conducted by Post RSO, we believe Pegasus is a 
legitimate company appropriately licensed by the Government 
of Turkey to engage in defense services.  Company 
representatives were fully cooperative and have expressed 
willingness to respond to any additional questions from the 
USG.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to the information provided by company 
representatives, Pegasus was established in 2003.  Its 
principal officers include: Ismail Turgut (Managing 
Director), retired Air Force Brigadier General Bulent Tuzcu 
(consultant), and Unal Kahveci (Project Manager). 
 
¶3. (SBU) The company has been accredited by the Turkish 
Ministry of National Defense to store defense 
items within their facilities.  Turgut showed us the Facility 
Security Clearance Certificates for each of the sites signed 
by the Ministry of Foreign Affair's NATO and Euro-Atlantic 
Infrastructure and Logistics Department.  Regular annual 
inspections made by NATO-certified teams from the Ministry of 
National Defense ensure that its main office in Ankara, the 
Ostum Repair Center near Ankara, and the Aegean Free Zone in 
Izmir (Note: We did not visit the latter two sites.  End 
Note) all met NATO security standards.  The company has one 
additional storage facility located in the United Kingdom. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Company representatives told us that they handle and 
store items on the USML only for the Turkish Armed Forces, 
their main client.  The company does business with entities 
from all the branches of the military, and its primary 
business is importing materials for and providing repair 
services to the Turkish military.  Turgut provided assurances 
that the company did not do business with countries outside 
of NATO. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Based on the site visit, the information provided by 
company representatives and a name check conducted by Post,s 
RSO, we believe the company is a bona fide company authorized 
by the GoT to conduct business in defense services.
