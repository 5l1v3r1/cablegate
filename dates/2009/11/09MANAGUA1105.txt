REF: STATE 114913; MANAGUA 889 
 
SUMMARY 
 
¶1. (SBU)  On November 19, Econoffs met with Emilio Rappaccioli, 
Nicaragua's Minister of Energy and Mines (MEM), and delivered an 
invitation to attend the Energy and Climate Ministerial of the 
Americas, April 15-16, 2010, in Washington, D.C. (Ref A).  The 
Minister expressed interest in attending; however, he shared an 
invitation for a conflicting engagement on energy issues to be held 
in Germany for the same dates.  [Action Request:  Post requests 
clarification from DOE and DOS about how to address this timing 
conflict.]  Rappaccioli said that approximately 35% of Nicaraguans 
lack access to electricity, and he described critical energy 
infrastructure projects involving hydroelectric, geothermal, and 
wind energy.  Minister Rappaccioli's interest in participating in 
the Ministerial is a departure from MEM's recent lukewarm response 
to our previous efforts to engage on energy and climate change 
issues (Ref B).  Unfortunately, the conflict between the U.S. forum 
and the simultaneous meeting in Germany means that he is unlikely 
to attend our event. 
 
GON COMMITTED TO ATTENDING LAC-EU ENERGY FORUM APRIL 15-16, 2010 

¶2. (U) On November 19, Econoffs met with Emilio Rappaccioli, Nicaragua's Minister of Energy and Mines, and delivered an invitation to attend the Energy and Climate Ministerial of the Americas, April 15-16, 2010, in Washington, D.C. (Ref A). The Minister said that he would like to attend; however, he shared an invitation for a conflicting engagement on energy issues to be held in Germany for the same dates (entitled "European Union and Latin America and the Caribbean Forum on Technical Cooperation, Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency"). Post has transmitted a scanned copy of this invitation via e-mail to the Department. Rappaccioli expressed interest in resolving the scheduling conflict so that he could attend both events.
 
¶3. (U)  Rappaccioli explained that in the absence of a change in 
dates, he would be inclined to attend the meeting in Europe since 
he received that invitation first.  First Lady Rosario Murillo 
instructed him on November 19 to follow-up with the Europeans 
regarding his personal attendance. 
 
NICARAGUAN ENERGY PRIORITIES 
 
¶4. (U)  Approximately 35% of Nicaraguans lack access to 
electricity, according to Rappaccioli.  He emphasized the 
importance of small renewable energy projects, involving 
hydroelectric and wind energy, to help reach rural communities that 
are without electricity.  MEM is emphasizing the importance of 
energy efficiency and renewable energy by working in conjunction 
with the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Trade, Industry, 
and Development to introduce a relevant curriculum to fourth, 
fifth, and sixth graders throughout the country. 
 
¶5. (U)  Rappaccioli outlined a five-year plan focusing on improving 
energy efficiency and described projects ranging from private 
sector energy audits, funded by the Inter-American Development 
Bank, to the GON's own efforts to replace inefficient equipment 
throughout their offices.  As testament to this effort, a South 
Korean funded solar panel project is almost completed at the MEM 
offices in Managua.   Rappaccioli described critical energy 
infrastructure projects involving hydroelectric, geothermal, and 
wind energy.  He said that from November 23-25, he would visit 
Washington, D.C., to meet with representatives from the World Bank, 
the Inter-American Development Bank, and Canadian company Polaris 
regarding a geothermal energy project in San Jacinto Tizate. 
Rappaccioli placed special emphasis on Tumarin, a Brazilian-funded 
200 megawatt hydroelectric project planned for construction on the 
Rio Grande de Matagalpa. 
 
COMMENT 
 
¶6. (SBU)  Minister Rappaccioli's interest in participating in the 
Ministerial is a departure from MEM's recent lukewarm response to 
our previous efforts to engage on energy and climate change issues 
(Ref B).   Unfortunately, the conflict between the U.S. forum and 
the simultaneous meeting in Germany means that he is unlikely to 
attend our event.  [Action Request:  Post requests clarification 
from DOE and DOS about how to address this timing conflict.]
