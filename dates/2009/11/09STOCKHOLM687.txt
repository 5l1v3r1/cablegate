¶1. (U) Poloff shared reftel points with Fredrik Folkunger, 
Desk Officer, Department of West Africa and the Horn of 
Africa on November 3.  Folkunger expressed enthusiasm for the 
new U.S. Sudan strategy and emphasized that the Swedes "see 
no real divergent opinions" in the text.  Sweden supports 
cooperation both on Darfur and CPA implementation and calls 
for strengthening of the justice system, but they recognize 
that the particular mechanism for justice should be in the 
hands of the Sudanese.  According to Folkunger, health and 
education are main Swedish development priorities.  Ahead of 
elections next year, there is also interest in supporting a 
safe electoral process.  Current Swedish development 
cooperation amounts to about $28 million and humanitarian 
assistance is set at $38 million.  This work is carried out 
primarily in the South. 
 
¶2. (U) Folkunger reiterated the continued interest, not only 
by the Swedes but also by the EU, in hosting Special Envoy 
Scott Gration at a Political and Security Council (PSC) 
meeting in Brussels.  Folkunger said that the Swedes will 
reach out through their Embassy in Washington about arranging 
such a visit.
