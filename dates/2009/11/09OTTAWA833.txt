Â¶1. (U) The Secretary's letter and proposal were delivered to 
Foreign Minister Cannon.  The proposal was also shared with the 
Ministry of Agriculture and Agrifood Canada (AAFC) and the Canadian 
International Development Agency (CIDA).   Jennifer MacKay, 
Development Policy Officer, Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
Canada, said that this it is likely that Minister Cannon will 
continue to have the lead on this issue with input from AAFC and 
CIDA and noted in general that they shared our views.  The proposal 
was also forwarded to Canada's team in Rome responsible for 
negotiating at the World Food Security Summit.  The primary POC in 
Rome is Adair Heuchan.  If additional information is made available 
it will be forwarded.
