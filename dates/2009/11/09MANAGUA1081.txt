REF: STATE 116264 
 
(U) Post delivered the points as instructed per REFTEL.  Our 
Foreign Ministry counterparts told us that Canada had already 
lobbied them for support on its substantive resolution against 
Iran, and that Nicaragua may abstain from voting on "no action" 
motions; however, it is more likely that Nicaragua will vote 
against U.S. positions.
