¶2. (SBU) On November 3, PolOff met with Assel Utegenova, head of 
MFA's Cultural and Humanitarian Cooperation Division, to deliver 
reftel points on the upcoming General Assembly debate on the Report 
of the UN Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict (the Goldstone 
Report).  Utegenova conveyed her familiarity with the report but 
lack of knowledge regarding its recommendations.  She thanked PolOff 
for providing the details.  She said the MFA was still formulating 
its position on the report, but promised the government will take 
the U.S. position under advisement.
