SUBJECT: RWANDA APPROVES BIOFUELS PROJECT 
 
¶1. (U) The Government of Rwanda (GOR) on October 28 approved 
a U.S.private sector-sponsored $40 million biofuels project 
in eastern Rwanda.  American-owned Eco-Fuel Global and 
British-owned Eco-Fuel Positive will jointly develop 10,000 
hectares of marginal land for production of jatropha and 
build vegetable oil extraction facilities to process jatropha 
oil and jatropha seed cake (used as fertilizer).  Eco-Fuel 
Global estimates the project will produce between 4-5 million 
gallons of bio-fuel annually (after eight years, when the 
jatropha trees reach full maturity), about 10 percent of 
Rwanda's current diesel consumption. 
 
¶2. (U) Minister of State for Energy Albert Butare told the 
press October 30, the "project is in line with the country's 
plan to move towards a greener economy and reduce carbon 
emissions."  The land allocated to the project, while poor 
farmland, is suitable for jatropha production, he added.  The 
proposed jatropha cultivation is labor intensive and, 
according to the developers, will provide sustained 
employment for 6,500 laborers over the 30-year life of the 
project. 
 
¶3. (U) The project business plan proposes $35-$50 million in 
foreign direct investment during the first five years of the 
project and up to $250 million of capital and operational 
investment over the life of the project.  According to 
Eco-Fuel Global's website, jatropha is drought resistant and 
has an oil content of 30-40 percent.  The website notes that 
in 2008, jatropha was used in a 50/50 blend with standard jet 
fuel to power a two-hour flight in New Zealand.  A by-product 
of jatropha, jatropha cake, is used as fertilizer.
