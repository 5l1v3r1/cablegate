Dear Ambassador Scobey, 
 
I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks and appreciation 
to you and your entire team at Embassy Cairo for facilitating 
Secretary Clinton,s recent visit to Cairo.  Please share my 
appreciation with all involved for their superb efforts in 
making the visit a success. 
 
Undoubtedly, this unplanned visit, like other high-level 
visits Embassy Cairo coordinates on a regular basis, took a 
toll on Post,s resources.  It demanded seamless coordination 
and adaptability from the entire Embassy staff. 
 
Embassy Cairo,s success in orchestrating this visit under 
these circumstances contributed significantly to the 
U.S.-Egypt bilateral relationship as well as to our efforts 
to promote a comprehensive peace in the Middle East.  Again, 
we greatly appreciate all you and your team did to make this 
visit such a success. 
 
Best, 
 
 
 
Jeffrey Feltman 
Assisant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs 
CLINTON
