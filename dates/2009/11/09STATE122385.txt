SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK 
ON THE EXPORT OF U.S. DEFENSE ARTICLES CITING THE CANADIAN 
EXEMPTION 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Embassy's assistance in 
conducting a post-shipment check on a transaction citing the 
Canadian exemption for the export of displacement gyroscopes 
to Canada.  Embassy is requested to complete this Blue 
Lantern check within 45 days.  Lack of response to a Blue 
Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: Under ITAR 126.5 (Canadian Exemption), 
certain United States Munitions List (USML) items may be 
exported to Canada without a license.  Some items on USML 
Category VIII - which includes displacement gyroscopes - may 
be subject to Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) 
restrictions and may require a license depending on commodity 
specification and type.  DDTC requests this check based on 
vague description of commodity and end-use in export filing. 
 
¶4. ACTION OTTAWA: Mission Canada is requested to make 
inquiries with appropriate MHD International Aviation Parts 
(MHD) officials to obtain all relevant details regarding the 
export of displacement gyroscopes to Canada citing the 
Canadian exemption, including exact commodity description and 
technical parameters for performance and capability, number, 
type, dollar value, and serial number of items.  (See 
paragraph 5 for details of export, including filer 
identification and shipping reference numbers). 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--What were the exact United States Munitions List (USML) 
articles exported to you on February 21st 2007?  (Automated 
Export System (AES) filing data provides the following 
information, "displacement gyroscope".)  Please provide 
detail on model, type and technical specifications. 
 
--What is the exact end-use for these USML items?  Will MHD 
be the sole end-user and retain positive control over the 
displacement gyroscopes at all times?  Will they be 
transferred to other end-users in Canada or re-exported? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on USML items, 
especially the prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer 
and re-export? 
 
END ACTION.
