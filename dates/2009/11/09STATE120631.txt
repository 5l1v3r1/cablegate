REF: STATE 111350 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY: November 9-11, officials from ARF's 27 nations 
gathered in New Delhi to discuss the coming year's ARF cooperation 
agenda and to provide updates on ARF's efforts in transnational 
security and preventive diplomacy.  Vietnam briefed its plans for the 
ARF Vision Statement implementation plan.  Additionally, they 
discussed various regional security issues such as North Korea, 
Burma, and Afghanistan/Pakistan.  The U.S. objectives for the next 
year will be to develop solid, concrete initiatives, a strong Vision 
Statement Implementation Plan, and to enhance ARF's role as a key 
regional security forum.  END SUMMARY 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
DISCUSSION ON REGIONAL/INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶2.  (U) ISG (Inter-sessional Support Group) delegates delivered 
prepared remarks on a number of regional, international, and 
non-traditional security issues.  These included: 
 
¶3.  (SBU) NORTH KOREA: A number of delegations (including USDEL) from 
Northeast Asia delivered pointed remarks regarding the need for North 
Korea to return to the Six-Party Talks and regional implementation of 
UNSCR 1874 and other relevant UNSCRs.  ROK and Japan largely welcomed 
the planned U.S. bilateral engagement of North Korea, but urged that 
it occur within the Six-Party framework.  China's comments took a 
middle road, calling for restraint and the restarting of the 
Six-Party Talks in its short briefing on PM Wen Jiabao's visit to 
Pyongyang. 
 
¶4. (SBU) BURMA:  Like-minded delegations, including strong remarks 
from Indonesia, consistently raised Burma in their interventions. 
They called for free and fair 2010 elections, the release of 
political prisoners like Aung San Suu Kyi, and an inclusive, 
democratic political process.  Many specifically welcomed the 
outcomes of the U.S. policy review and our engagement with the 
regime.  USDEL delivered similar remarks and briefed ARF on the main 
aspects of EAP A/S Campbell and DAS Marciel's recent trip to Burma. 
Burma also gave a briefing regarding recent U.S. visits by A/S 
Campbell and Senator Webb, highlighting what they characterized as 
the regime's willingness to grant access to senior Burmese officials 
and to Aung San Suu Kyi. 
 
¶5. (SBU) AFGHANISTAN/PAKISTAN:   In a change from previous ARF 
meetings, a large number of delegations also shared their concerns 
regarding developments in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Many called for 
greater international assistance to both countries.  Following PM 
Hatoyama's announcement the day before, Japan noted its commitment of 
$5 billion to Afghanistan despite the end of its Indian Ocean 
refueling mission.  India delivered pointed remarks regarding the 
terrorist threat from groups in Pakistan.  The Pakistan delegation 
did not take the floor during this session.  Pakistan instead 
distributed a short non-paper objecting to the U.S. and others' 
linking Pakistan with Afghanistan in an "Af-Pak" theater.  Pakistan 
countered that its issues are distinct and that it should not be tied 
to Afghanistan.   The non-paper also outlined Pakistan's opposition 
to terrorism and its efforts against Taliban elements. 
 
¶6. (SBU) REMAINING SECURITY ISSUES DISCUSSED:  A few delegations also 
raised a number of other security issues including: 
 
-- The rise of illegal immigration in the Asia-Pacific region 
-- Developments in the South China Sea (Note:  Vietnam raised this 
issue in its intervention and ISG co-Chair Vietnam Assistant Minister 
for Foreign Affairs Pham Quang Vinh told USDEL that his country was 
concerned about growing Chinese assertiveness in the region.  End 
Note.) 
-- Concern over Iran's nuclear program 
-- Strengthening the international nonproliferation and disarmament 
regime and welcoming U.S.-Russia START developments 
-- Non-traditional security issues like climate change, people 
smuggling, illegal fishing, food and energy security, and piracy.

ARF COOPERATION; VISION STATEMENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN 
--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
¶7. (U) VISION STATEMENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN:  Vietnam briefed its 
plans for implementing the ARF's vision statement endorsed by ARF 
Ministers in July 2009.  Vietnam plans to solicit initial input from 
ARF members over the next few months and then to submit a formal 
draft for ARF approval in a few months.  Vietnam hopes that the 
implementation plan will be action-oriented and will avoid the 
 
STATE 00120631  002 OF 003 
 
 
conceptual debates already addressed during last year's vision 
statement negotiations.  The plan will balance both ARF's 
transnational security and preventive diplomacy agendas, and reflect 
ARF's resourcing needs. 
 
¶8. (U) WORK PLANS and ARF's FUNCTIONAL AREAS OF COOPERATION: Various 
delegations briefed the plenary on the status of ARF's multiple Work 
Plans. 
 
-- COUNTER TERRORISM AND TRANSNATIONAL CRIME (CTTC):  The ASEAN 
Secretariat, followed by USDEL, briefed on the CTTC Work Plan status. 
 They called for greater engagement by ARF members in its 
development, noted unfilled positions for Lead Countries in its three 
Priority Areas (narcotics, bioterrorism, and cybersecurity), and 
sought submission of project proposals.  USDEL introduced a concept 
paper for an ARF Conference of Experts on Cyber Crime, seeking 
expedited approval by ARF in order to occur in Spring 2010.  Russia, 
joined by its fellow ARF CTTC co-chair Brunei, suggested a slower 
timeline due to their plans for a cybersecurity focus for their 
co-chaired annual ARF CTTC meeting also during Spring 2010.  The 
Russian, Bruneian, and U.S. delegations discussed holding the two 
events back-to-back. 
 
-- NONPROLIFERATION AND DISARMAMENT (NPD):  USDEL briefed on its NPD 
Work Plan.  The Work Plan is currently in draft form and USDEL shared 
it with a number of key ARF delegations.  Pending their interest in 
engaging with the NPD Work Plan, USDEL plans to table it for official 
ARF consideration at the next ISG in Spring 2010. 
 
-- DISASTER RELIEF (DR):  USDEL and other key ARF members briefed on 
the recent ARF annual meeting on disaster relief and the status of 
ARF's various disaster relief initiatives (ref A). Indonesia 
presented its initial preparations for a March 2011 ARF Disaster 
Relief Exercise.  USDEL tabled a revised version of its Model 
Arrangement concept, an ARF-negotiated model text for temporary 
disaster relief status of forces arrangements. 
 
-- MARITIME SECURITY:  New Zealand, incoming host of ARF's next 
annual maritime security meeting, and other delegations welcomed U.S. 
plans to strengthen ARF maritime security interoperability through 
promoting regional use of maritime information-sharing systems. 
 
-- PREVENTIVE DIPLOMACY (PD):  New Zealand and Singapore briefed ARF 
on their views regarding the development of an ARF PD Work Plan. 
ARF's supplementary Track Two process, Expert and Emiment Persons 
(EEP), will develop the first draft of the Work Plan during their 
mid-December meeting in Indonesia.  Once finalized by the EEPs, the 
Work Plan would be introduced into the government track. 
 
-- ANNUAL SECURITY OUTLOOK (ASO) STANDARDIZED FORMAT:  After a 
six-month negotiation, the ASEAN Secretariat briefed ARF on its plans 
for a standardized ASO format.  The ASO is a reporting mechanism to 
share information regarding security and defense policies, and 
activities in the region. 
 
¶9. (U) STRENGTHENING THE ROLES OF DEFENSE OFFICIALS:  Raising a theme 
echoed during the earlier November 9 ARF Defense Officials Dialogue, 
ARF officials discussed strengthening the role and engagement of 
defense officials in ARF.  Vietnam presented a modest plan to 
rearrange the Defense Officials Dialogue meetings, and other 
delegations (including USDEL) gave suggestions as well.  On November 
9, ARF defense officials discussed three topics in their half-day 
meeting: maritime security and illegal fishing, strengthening ARF 
defense and security cooperation, and disaster relief.

STATE 00120631  003 OF 003 
 
 
solid, concrete initiatives and a strong Vision Statement 
Implementation Plan during this coming year.  This approach will help 
in directing ARF to achieve more tangible results, expand its role as 
a key regional security organization and further U.S. engagement with 
the 27 member countries.
