SUBJECT: EXIM OFFICIALS SEEK OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPAND PARTICIPATION 
IN INDONESIA 
 
¶1. (SBU) During a recent visit to Indonesia, Member of the Board of 
Directors of the U.S. Export-Import Bank Diane Farrell and Vice 
President Ray Ellis met with bank executives to explore the 
possibility of establishing a credit facility.  ExIm also met U.S. 
and Indonesian business executives Indonesian government officials 
to seek opportunities for expanded participation in the Indonesian 
power and infrastructure sectors. 
 
Credit Facility Garners Interest 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Senior officials from five domestic Indonesian banks - 
Mandiri, BCA, BNI, Danamon, and the Indonesia ExImbank - expressed 
interest in participating in a credit facility with ExIm.  Under 
this facility, the participating domestic bank will vet local 
projects and act as a domestic lender or guarantor.  ExIm will then 
provide a guarantee to an international lending bank, which will 
provide financing for the project through the domestic bank.  This 
arrangement will facilitate ExIm participation by reducing the 
country risk premiums required on non-sovereign loans by Footnote 4 
of ExIm's Country Limitation Schedule.  Farrell and Ellis also met 
with Citibank to discuss the credit facility, although that bank is 
unlikely to participate as a local lender.  Citibank can play a role 
as one of the guaranteed lenders. 
 
¶3. (SBU) All five Indonesian banks expressed a desire for new 
lending opportunities, because they all currently have a surplus of 
cash.  Sebastian Paredes, the President Director of Danamon Bank, 
stated that Indonesian banks' response to the financial crisis a 
year ago was to increase cash reserves.  However, he said the 
resulting surplus of cash was not an optimum situation, either. 
 
ExIm and Electricity Development 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) ExIm also seeks to support U.S. participation in 
Indonesia's power sector development.  Indonesia plans to add an 
additional 10,000 MW of power generation capacity, including about 
3,600 MW of geothermal power, much of it through independent power 
producers.  ExIm participation in the sector has so far been 
hampered by the lack of sovereign guarantees for PLN, the 
state-owned electricity monopoly.  Director of Geothermal Sugiharto 
Harsoprayitno and PLN Chairman Alhilal Hamdi stated that the 
Presidential decree that will authorize the new 10,000 MW plan will 
include an explicit government guarantee for the electricity offtake 
contracts.  Farrell stated that, depending on how the guarantee is 
worded, ExIm may be able to consider it a sovereign guarantee and 
offer support for these projects. 
 
¶5. (U) Ray Ellis has cleared on this cable.
