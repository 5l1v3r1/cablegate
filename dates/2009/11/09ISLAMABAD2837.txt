¶1. (S/NF) Summary:  Pakistani ground forces advanced into the  interior of Makin, where they appear to be meeting little  resistance in the sixth week of Operation Rah-e-Nijat (""Path  of Salvation""), the Pakistan military's air and ground  offensive against the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP)  militants in the Mehsud tribal area of South Waziristan.  On  November 19, the 11th Corps' 14th Infantry Division entered  Janata with only light resistance.  Meanwhile, operations  have expanded into the northern FATA where Frontier Corps  (FC) units backed by gunships and artillery hit insurgent  targets in Orakzai Agency, destroying a number of insurgent  hideouts and reportedly making a number of arrests.  End  Summary. 
 
¶2.  (S//NF) The Pakistan military's Operation Rah-e-Nijat  continues as ground forces control the three former TTP  strongholds of Ladha, Makin and Sora Rogha (also known as  Sorarogha) in the Mehsud tribal area of South Waziristan. 
The 7th Division moved substantial forces into the Makin  interior with apparent impunity, which suggests they are  meeting light resistance.  On November 19, the 14th Division  moved into Janata.   Additionally, we have seen  evidence that 7th Division and Frontier Corps units have  entered Ghariam farther north.  In each instance, we assess  little militant resistance.  In the case of Janata, this is  surprising given its reputation as an Uzbek stronghold. 
Meanwhile air strikes were conducted in South Waziristan and  the northern FATA throughout the week. 
 
 STATUS OF GROUND FORCES 
----------------------- 
 
¶3.  (S/NF) On the southeast axis, the 14th Division task  force, which entered Janata on November 19, has secured key  terrain to over watch and isolate the widely scattered  compounds that comprise the town.  Clearing operations  continue, but resistance around Janata has reportedly been  light.  Open sources reported that a large cache of weapons  and ammunition was seized in Janata on November 20, which  suggests that the insurgents conducted a hasty withdrawal. 
 
¶4.  (S/NF) On the southwest axis, the 9th Division has  secured Ladha and appears to have initiated a deliberate  attack toward Makin on November 23.  Insurgent resistance in  and around Kaniguram (five miles southwest of Ladha) and in  Ladha continues, though with significantly less intensity. 
 
¶5.  (S/NF) In the north, units of the 7th Division have  entered Makin and appear to have unfettered access to the  village.  There has been little evidence of fighting in or  near the village for the past several days.  Maneuver units  continue to occupy blocking positions north, southeast, and  southwest of the built-up area of that town.  Meanwhile, 7th  Division units continue to clear the area north of Makin in  the area of Tauda China and along the entire Razmak-Makin  Line of Communication (LOC). 
 
¶6.  (S/NF) In related action in North Waziristan, an infantry  company team has established a blocking position five miles  east of Razmak and an Army battalion, an FC wing, and an  artillery battalion are in position at Ghariam, 7 miles east  of Kund Mela.  Operation ""Pash Ziarat"", a small-scale  operation of battalion task force strength, is designed to  link-up forces between Mana and Razmak at the village of Pash  Ziarat Narai and clear insurgent forces that likely fled from  the Mehsud tribal area.  The likely intent of these  deployments is to intercept militants who attempt to flee  from Makin and Janata to North Waziristan and the northern  FATA.  The FATA Secretariat reports fighting among Wazir  tribes, who have a neutrality agreement with the Pakistani  military, on whether to allow fleeing Mehsud forces to cross  North Waziristan into Afghanistan. 
 
¶7.  (S/NF) Comment: Over the last several weeks, Operation  Rah-i-Nijat has significantly disrupted the command, control,  and logistics of the TTP, but it has not destroyed the TTP's  organization and network given the relatively light  resistance we have seen as ground forces retake control over  major roads and population centers.  Our assessment is that  TTP Leaders and the preponderance of their forces have  largely evaded 11th Corps' operation, fleeing to Orakzai,  Khyber and Kurram Agencies via North Waziristan and/or  Afghanistan.  This highlights the importance of Frontier  Corps operations in Kurram, Khyber, and Orakzai Agencies to  interdict significant TTP elements that have likely moved  northward, but we cannot yet determine if the FC's efforts  are capable of effectively pursuing them.  Snow already is  falling in the mountain passes and the Tirah Valley  stronghold of the TTP, but action is still possible in and  around Orakzai and Kurram. 
 
¶8.  (S/NF) On a brighter note, there is the possibility that  operations in the northern FATA may provide additional  opportunities to embed U.S. Special Operations Forces with FC  units to provide ISR support and general operational  guidance.  If we can expand on what we have recently been  doing on Bajaur Agency reftel F) with our embeds, it would be  a significant opportunity to contribute to the pursuit of the  TTP.
