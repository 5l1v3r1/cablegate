SUBJECT: REVISED JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (11/3): Palestinians 
skeptical of the US position on settlements 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The dailies lead with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton stating 
that the US position regarding settlement activity has not changed. 
Reports highlight that Secretary Clinton and Special Envoy George 
Mitchell reversed tone after widespread anger erupted throughout the 
Arab world after earlier statements praising Israeli actions on 
settlement activity. Al-Quds leads with a headline saying "After 
Palestinian Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas did not waiver 
from the PA's position regarding settlements, Clinton and Mitchell 
reversed the language and reiterated the need for the complete 
cessation of settlement activity." Al-Hayat Al-Jadida's lead 
headline quotes Clinton as saying "President Abbas has made positive 
initiatives and Israel has to take on similar steps." Clinton is 
quoted in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida noting that the Israeli proposal to 
control settlement activity was below expectations. 
 
The coverage also highlights the meeting between President Abbas and 
Special Envoy Mitchell in Amman yesterday. Al Quds and Al-Hayat 
Al-Jadida report on Saeb Erekat's statement to the press after the 
Abbas-Mitchell meeting, quoting Mitchell as saying, "The position of 
the administration has not changed. Settlements are illegitimate and 
expropriating [land in] East Jerusalem is also illegitimate." The 
coverage also notes that Abbas agreed with Mitchell to continue the 
talks and showed a readiness to implement Palestinian obligations if 
Israel does the same. 
 
Al-Quds quotes Arab League Secretary General Amer Mousa noting that 
if the US fails to revive the peace talks, it would be their own 
fault because of the extra protection it grants to Israel. 
 
The dailies highlight news on the Jerusalem municipality demolishing 
three homes that belong to Palestinian families in East Jerusalem, 
leaving 41 people homeless. The coverage notes that the demolition 
was done under Israeli police protection. Al Quds and Al-Ayyam ran 
front page photos of demonstrations against the home demolitions in 
front of the Consulate's Post II consular facility in East 
Jerusalem.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
 
1) Rasem Ebidat opines in Al Quds independent daily under the title 
"Finally, the American Intentions Are Revealed" (11/03): "When 
President Obama took office, all Arabs were optimistic and very 
supportive of his policies ... We all thought his era would witness 
the beginning of strong Arab-American relations. However, Secretary 
Clinton's remarks revealed the true face of the American position 
and how much it resembles the Israeli position." 
 
2) Hani Al-Masri opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
title "After the US Retreat From Its Promises, What To Do?" (11/3): 
"Secretary Clinton's remarks reveal that Obama's administration is 
incapable of fulfilling its earlier promises ... Instead of exerting 
pressure on Israel, it shifted to placing pressure on the 
Palestinians ... The US has to realize that Israel is becoming a 
burden that obstructs peace and security in the whole region. Only 
then can a Palestinian state be achieved."
