REF: RIO DE JANEIRO 353; RIO DE JANEIRO 329 
 
¶1. (U) Rio Radar is a regular compilation of key economic, 
political, commercial, and other developments in the states of Rio 
de Janeiro, Bahia, Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, and Sergipe.  This 
week's subjects: 
 
 
 
NATION-WIDE BLACKOUT 
 
 
 
¶2. (U) On November 10, a massive power outage affected 18 states, 
leaving an estimated 87 million residents without power and leading 
to persistent doubts over the cause, as well as concerns over 
Brazilian energy infrastructure.  In Rio de Janeiro, the blackout 
lasted between two and three hours, shutting off electricity for 
some 6 million residents and disrupting the water supply for over 1 
million.  According to accounts from the Ministry of Mines and 
Energy and the National Power Grid Operator (ONS), lightning 
strikes caused three transmission lines between the Itaipu 
hydroelectric station and Sao Paulo to fail, causing a cascading 
blackout that led to the loss of 28,000 megawatts - or 45 percent 
of total Brazilian consumption at that instant - of electricity. 
Experts outside of the government dispute this explanation, 
however.  Further Mission reporting on the incident and related 
concerns will be provided septel. 
 
 
 
UNHCHR PRAISES FAVELA PACIFICATION, WORRIED OVER POLICE VIOLENCE 
 
 
 
¶3. (U) On November 10, 2009, the United Nations High Commissioner 
for Human Rights (UNHCHR) Navanethem Pillay visited the favela 
community of Santa Marta, the same favela Rio Principal Officer 
toured on October 16 (reftel A).  Minister for Racial Equality 
Edson Santos and Rio de Janeiro State Secretary for Public Security 
Jose Beltrame accompanied the visit.  While praising Rio de 
Janeiro's Favela Pacification Program and the efforts of Rio's 
Pacification Police Units, or UPP, (reftel B) in bringing order to 
the community, Pillay criticized the level of violence in other 
favelas.  "There still is an unacceptably high level of violence 
and killings, especially from police actions," she said.  According 
to the Rio de Janeiro Institute of Public Security, Rio de Janeiro 
military police were involved in some 10,216 killings related to 
resisting arrest since 1998.  During her trip to Brazil, Pillay 
also visited Salvador and Brasilia. 
 
 
 
NEW STEEL PLANT TO INCREASE RIO'S CO2 EMISSIONS BY 76 PERCENT 
 
 
 
¶4. (U) According to forecasts by the Rio de Janeiro State Secretary 
for Environment, a new plant under construction in Rio de Janeiro 
state by steel manufacturer CSA (Companhia Siderurgica do 
Atlantico) will emit 9.7 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) into 
the atmosphere annually, increasing the city's carbon dioxide 
emissions by 76 percent.  CSA is a partnership between German 
Thyssenkrupp Steel Group (73 percent share) and Brazilian mining 
company Vale - CVRD (27 percent share).  In response, the Brazilian 
Minister of Environment and the Rio City Council's Environmental 
Commission plan to "pressure" the company to seek new technologies 
and plant millions of trees to mitigate the emissions. 
 
 
 
¶5. (U) Thyssenkrupp is constructing the 6.7 billion USD plant - the 
largest private investment in Brazil over the past 12 years - in 
Western Rio de Janeiro state.  The plant, which will produce over 5 
million tons of steel plates per year, envisions the creation of 
over 17,000 new jobs, as well as the construction of two new port 
facilities.
