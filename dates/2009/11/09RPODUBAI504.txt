SUBJECT: IRAN PRESS/NUCLEAR: IAEA REPRESENTATIVE SOLTANIAH ON 
ENRICHMENT ABOVE FIVE PERCENT, FUEL DELIVERY GUARANTEES 
 
TITLE: Soltanieh in Talk with ISNA: No Document Says We Can't 
Enrich More Than 5 Percent; Guarantees for the Timely Delivery 
of TRR Fuel is the Most Pivotal Subject of Negotiations 
 
 
 
SUMMARY: In comments reported in a November 22 ISNA article, 
IRIG IAEA Representative Soltanieh said: 
 
 
 
- We are prepared for discussions with a positive outlook, but 
the most pivotal issue is the guarantee of the timely provision 
of [nuclear] fuel for our nation's medical needs; we need to 
receive such guarantees due to the history of lack of confidence 
Iran has in relation to the West concerning nuclear issues. 
 
 
 
-Iran's economic and technical concerns re the circumstances of 
the fuel delivery must be taken into consideration. 
 
 
 
- I hope the IAEA can act according to its obligations in 
creating conditions allowing member countries their rights based 
on the charter. 
 
 
 
- [Re latest IAEA report]: In this report, like all the other 
reports, El-Baradei announced that Iran's enrichment activities 
are in accordance with its legal commitments to the IAEA and are 
for peaceful purposes. 
 
 
 
- [Re recent imputations that Iran's enriching to higher than 5 
percent would imply military uses of the uranium]: In no 
international document, especially the IAEA charter and the NPT 
and even in the latest document re inspections, i.e. the 
Additional Protocol, there are no limitations for enrichment for 
member countries and no ceiling has been specified: it is only 
the case that member countries must announce to the IAEA their 
enrichment activities, to include the specifications and levels 
of enrichment, and the IAEA can only verify the correctness of 
the announcements and make clear that deviations from these 
activities into proscribed activities has not occurred.
