SUBJECT: PROSECUTOR SINKS CASE AGAINST CORRUPT ADMIRAL 

CLASSIFIED BY: William R. Brownfield, Ambassador; REASON: 1.4(B), (D) 

¶1. (C) SUMMARY:  The Prosecutor General's Office (Fiscalia) and the 
Inspector General's Office (Procuraduria) unexpectedly reversed 
course and called for all charges to be dropped in the case against 
retired Rear Admiral GarbrielArangoBacci for alleged links with 
narco-trafficking.  In addition, both legal entities are now 
calling for an investigation of Navy Commander Guillermo Barrera, 
who relieved ArangoBacci and referred his case to the civilian 
criminal courts.  While respecting Colombian jurisprudence, 
Ambassador Brownfield publicly asserted that the USG had a 
legitimate interest in the case in which ArangoBacci is accused of 
leaking to narco-traffickers the details of U.S. and Colombian 
interdiction patrols.  The Ambassador also commended the Navy for 
pressing the case against ArangoBacci transparently through the 
civilian justice system.  In response to the Ambassador's 
statement, a hostile Supreme Court magistrate accused him of 
meddling in a domestic issue.  If ArangoBacci is released, it 
effectively sends the message that flag-rank officers are nearly 
immune from prosecution, which could have a negative impact on 
human rights cases involving senior military officials.  End 
Summary.

¶2. (C) Rear Admiral Gabriel ArangoBacci was forced to retire in 
2007 on suspicion of drug trafficking, based on convincing evidence 
that he had conspired with drug traffickers to help them evade U.S. 
and Colombian interdiction patrols.  A military tribunal found 
ArangoBacci guilty of accepting a $115,000 bribe in exchange for 
alerting drug traffickers to patrol coordinates and even ordering 
the movement of a Colombian frigate.  Navy Commander Admiral 
Guillermo Barrera took the additional step of referring Arango
Bacci's case to the civilian Prosecutor General's Office for 
criminal charges; the case was nearing a guilty verdict by 
mid-2009.  However, in an unusual turn of events, on November 3 a 
prosecutor newly assigned to the case by Acting Prosecutor General 
Guillermo Mendoza Diago petitioned the Supreme Court to absolve 
ArangoBacci.  The new prosecutor claimed the investigation had not 
provenArangoBacci's guilt, adding that Admiral Barrera had 
falsely accused ArangoBacci to ruin his naval career - an 
assertion the defendant has made since his arrest.  A prosecutor 
assigned to the Prosecutor General's office alleged that witnesses 
againstArangoBacci were tainted because "they had contact with 
the DEA and CIA."  Both the Prosecutor General's Office and the 
Inspector General's Office denounced the Navy for framing Arango
Bacci and have called on the Supreme Court to investigate Admiral 
Barrera and other senior officers for falsifying evidence.

¶3. (C) During a justice sector conference in Boyaca Department on 
November 5, the Ambassador raised the case privately with the 
Supreme Court President, Prosecutor General, and Inspector General.
He also told press that, while the case was a matter for the 
Colombian courts to decide, the United States maintained a clear 
interest in its outcome.  He commended Colombian Navy leadership 
for referring the case to civilian prosecutors, thus avoiding 
accusations of a cover-up.  The Ambassador also privately raised
the issue with Minister of Defense Silva, who thanked the 
Ambassador for his public statement in a corruption case that had 
damaged the military's reputation.  Silva said that if he was to 
prosecute senior officers for abuses, he needed some public 
support.  In response to the Ambassador's comments, Supreme Court 
Magistrate Alfredo Gomez Quintero - a consistent foe of extradition 
and of U.S. policy in Colombia - blasted him for interfering in an 
internal matter and demanded that the Ambassador present the 
alleged evidence implicating Arango.  Supreme Court President 
Augusto Ibanez, however, publicly downplayed the Ambassador's 
comments.  On November 9, the Supreme Court's Penal Chamber denied 
a defense motion to grant conditional liberty for ArangoBacci
while his case is being resolved. 

¶4. (C) COMMENT: It is not clear what prompted the Prosecutor 
General's Office and Inspector General's about face on Arango
Bacci, though many Ministry of Defense officials suspect corruption 
is involved.  Embassy contacts have told us that, despite the 
Court's refusal to release ArangoBacci, the concurrence of both 
the Prosecutor General and Inspector General for dismissal make it 
highly likely that the case will be dropped.  DEA cautions that the 
criminal case against the rear admiral began as an intelligence 
case and, as a result, was never rock-solid.  The initial 
intelligence suggesting Arango'snarco-trafficking links could not 

be presented as evidence in the criminal proceedings - essentially 
creating an opportunity for the Fiscalia to find shortcomings with 
the case.  Still, the sudden insignificance of 150 pages of 
previously submitted evidence is disturbing.  The call to absolve 
ArangoBacci and to investigate the whistleblowers are serious 
setbacks for the Colombian justice system.  Moreover, we are keenly 
aware of the wider message here that trying a flag-rank officer in 
Colombia is not only difficult but also risky, a serious concern as 
the USG pushes for prosecution of high-level military officers 
accused of human rights abuses.  End Comment.
