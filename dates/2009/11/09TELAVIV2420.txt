¶1. (SBU) Per reftels, the GOI remains interested in hosting a 
Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) 
workshop focusing on legal aspects and the forensics involved 
with combating nuclear and radiological terrorism.  Per ref 
C, the GOI had agreed to postpone the workshop until a later 
date, and now proposes to host the workshop in Jerusalem on 
June 7-8, 2010.  According to Israel Atomic Energy Commission 
(IAEC) Acting Director Ronen Shaul, the GOI would be willing 
to discuss the workshop at the January 2010 Exercise Planning 
Group (EPG) in Budapest.  However, Shaul said the GOI would 
appreciate a confirmation from the GICNT co-chairs regarding 
the workshop prior to the EPG so that the GOI can begin 
planning activities.  Shaul discussed these issues with 
polmiloff on November 2.
