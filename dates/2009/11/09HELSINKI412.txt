¶1.  Pol/Econoff delivered reftel remarks to Kirsti 
Pohjankukka First Secretary for Human Rights Policy at the 
Ministry for Foreign Affairs.  Pohjankukka responded to USG's 
concern that the possible resolution may have an adverse 
impact on the peace process by stating that the peace process 
is GOF's priority on this issue.  At the same time, she 
stressed that GOF respects U.N. reports and sees this as an 
important one.  She followed that immediately by saying that 
the parties involved in the conflict should be the ones to 
take up the issues. 
 
¶2.  Pohjankukka noted that there is currently no common E.U. 
position but she expressed the expecation that the E.U. would 
arrive at a common position shortly.  She agrees that the 
mandate of the Goldstone mission was very one-sided and that 
it was important that the authors broadened their scope to 
address Hamas' actions.  Addressing the concern that any 
resolution based on the report likely would also be 
one-sided, she again brought up how the authors had taken the 
initiative to broaden the scope of the mandate.
