REF: A) BIS e-mail request dated October 22, 2009 (01210084) 
 
1.Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted 
a post shipment verification (PSV) at Wah Wai Electronic Technology, 
Room 1001, 10/F Wang Yip Industrial Building, No 1 Elm Street, Tai 
Kok Tsui, Hong Kong (Wah Wai). The items in question for this PSV 
are monolithic integrated circuits exported to Wah Wai on or about 
September 20, 2006.  These items are likely classified under Export 
Control Classification Number (ECCN) 3A001 and are controlled for 
national security (NS) reasons.  These circuits are likely eligible 
for license exception Civil End Use (CIV) for export/reexport to 
mainland China.  The exporter is America II Electronics of St. 
Petersburg, Florida. 
 
¶3.  According to the Hong Kong Companies Registry, Wah Wai has been 
in existence since March 1986.  Its paid up share capital is the 
Hong Kong equivalent of USD 65,000.  The Hong Kong Companies 
Registry lists Hong Kong residents Cheung, Hei Kwan (HKID 
P243933(A), Lee, Wah Wong (HKID H389299(O) and Li, Man Har (HKID 
K245459(9) as directors. 
 
¶4.  Wah Wai does not appear to have a web site of its own although 
it appears to advertise on B to B web sites including 
www.diytrade.com.   On that web site, the company's business is 
described as trade in high level electronic components at the 
military, industrial and commercial level. 
 
¶5.  On November 10, 2009, ECO and FCS Commercial Assistant Carrie 
Chan visited the company and met with Mr. Lee, Wah Wong, director. 
The company is located in a warehouse building and has space for 
several desks, a reception area and a small director's office. 
According to Mr. Lee, Wah Wai is a family business and the company 
owns the premises. 
 
¶6.  Mr. Lee stated that Wah Wai is a small trading company.  He 
offered that the company has seen a nearly 90% drop in its business 
this year.  Mr. Lee noted that it has become standard practice to 
sell to mainland customers in Hong Kong on a cash basis to avoid the 
risks associated with nonpayment by mainland customers.  Mr. Lee 
agreed that this practice may also be useful for minimizing customs 
formalities and duties at the Hong Kong/Shenzhen border.  Mr. Lee 
noted that most such transactions are actually completed by use of 
freight forwarders so as to insulate the buyer from any customs 
related issues (in this scenario, the freight forwarder sometimes 
also pays for the items in Hong Kong).  ECO suspects that this 
structure also serves other purposes  including export control 
avoidance. 
 
¶7.  Mr. Lee stated that he does not sell military temperature range 
products.  He expressed an understanding of U.S. export control 
rules and stated his commitment to comply with them.  By separate 
e-mail, ECO sent Mr. Lee additional information about U.S. export 
controls. 
¶8.  As to the particular shipment in question, Mr. Lee stated that 
the company no longer had any of the applicable documentation.  Mr. 
Lee stated that there are many changes in trading companies so he 
does not keep too many records.  Mr. Lee stated that the 
representative of the buyer, a Mr. Ching, had provided him with a 
phone number that is apparently no longer operational.  Mr. Lee 
stated that he did not know the final end-user or end-use for the 
items. 
 
¶9.  ECO notes that Mr. Lee was quite talkative when talking about 
the electronics business and expressed his commitment to comply with 
U.S. export controls.  At the same time, Mr. Lee did not provide ECO 
with any significant information about the underlying shipment. 
Based on a totality of the circumstances, ECO cannot recommend that 
Wah Wai be considered a suitable recipient of U.S. origin controlled 
technology.
