Classified By: Political-Economic Section Chief Dwight Nystrom.  Reason 
s 1.4(b/d). 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY: The ex-Guantanamo detainees in Ireland are 
performing most daily tasks on their own, but will require 
"long-term" assistance before being able to integrate into 
Irish society.  The Irish have requested the help of the 
International Organization for Migration (IOM) in arranging 
for the immediate family of one ex-detainee to reunite with 
him in Ireland.  The other ex-detainee is living on his own 
as an adult for the first time, and the Irish are concerned 
about his adjustment.  Our interlocutors describe both 
ex-detainees as psychologically "damaged," and say they are 
part of "world-wide network of ex-detainees" in regular 
contact with one another.  END SUMMARY. 
 
--------------------------------- 
TO RECEIVE PERMANENT HOUSING SOON 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) On November 10 Poloff spoke with Diarmuid Cole, 
Director General of the Office of the Minister for 
Integration, and his deputy, Anne O'Gorman, about the two 
Uzbek ex-Guantanamo detainees who arrived in Ireland on 
September 26, Oybek Jabbarov and Shakhrukh Hamiduva.  They 
are currently living in the quarters provided to them 
immediately after their arrival, a government-owned apartment 
building for asylum seekers in Ballyhaunis, a small town in 
County Mayo in the west of Ireland.  They will move out of 
their current quarters in three to four weeks.  They will 
then be settled in Galway, a city of 72,000 on the west 
coast.  Jabbarov will receive a house and Hamiduva an 
apartment within walking distance of Jabbarov's residence. 
 
----------------------------------- 
DAILY TASKS PERFORMED INDEPENDENTLY 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) Our interlocutors told us Jabbarov and Hamiduva were 
performing most daily tasks on their own ) shopping, 
cooking, etc.  They have not visited the local mosque, as far 
as our interlocutors know, but they shop in the town's halal 
store and perform daily prayers.  They have a two-hour 
English class five days per week, but Jabbarov only takes one 
hour because of trouble concentrating.  They are also taking 
a two-hour computer class twice a week.  They are receiving a 
stipend for daily expenses and have each been given a 
television set, a laptop and a cell phone. 
 
------------------------------ 
IRISH HELPING, NOT SUPERVISING 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (C) The Irish are helping, but not supervising, the 
ex-detainees.  Their apartment building is guarded by a 
private security firm, but the guards are there to protect 
all the residents of the building (approximately 70 Congolese 
refugees live in the building as well).  An official from the 
Office of the Minister of Integration is in the building 
during working hours to assist any of the residents who need 
it.  Ministry officials have taken the ex-detainees on trips 
to the west coast and to Dublin, to "get them out and 
familiarize them with the country," and they have a general 
practitioner who supervises their medical needs (such as, so 
far, back pain and provision of eyeglasses to one of them). 
 
------------------- 
CONTACT WITH FAMILY 
------------------- 
 
¶5. (C) They call their families frequently, although Hamiduva 
has had trouble reaching some of his family members, as they 
are under government surveillance in Uzbekistan.  With the 
help of the International Organization for Migration (IOM), 
Jabbarov's wife and two children have moved to a UNHCR camp 
near Islamabad, and the IOM has applied for exit visas for 
them so they can join Jabbarov in Ireland.  The ex-detainees 
have not indicated any interest in meeting other members of 
the Uzbek exile community in Ireland and did not want to meet 
with the International Committee of the Red Cross official, 
now based in London, who had followed their cases in

Guantanamo. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
EX-DETAINEES "DAMAGED" PSYCHOLOGICALLY 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (C) Our interlocutors repeatedly described the 
ex-detainees as "pretty damaged" psychologically.  They 
handle stress poorly, often calling to complain, sometimes 
vociferously, whenever anything major or minor goes wrong. 
Our contacts said Hamiduva is adjusting poorly to being out 
of detention for the first time in his life as an adult.  He 
does not really know how to function as an adult, the Irish 
said, and they are concerned that he might not adapt well to 
moving to an apartment in Galway without immediate access to 
Jabbarov.  The Irish said Hamiduva might have particular 
difficulty after Jabbarov's family joins him.  When asked 
whether the ex-detainees would be given job training, the 
Irish said, "not for a long time."  They said the 
ex-detainees would be neither psychologically nor 
linguistically prepared for job training for the foreseeable 
future. 
 
------------------------------------- 
"WORLD-WIDE NETWORK" OF EX-DETAINEES? 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (C) Our interlocutors reported that Jabbarov and Hamiduva 
had become part of a "world-wide network" of ex-Guantanamo 
detainees, talking by phone frequently with other 
ex-detainees, particularly those in the Bahamas and Albania. 
Our contacts said this had led to many allegations from 
Jabbarov and Hamiduva that they were not being treated as 
well in Ireland as ex-detainees in other countries.
