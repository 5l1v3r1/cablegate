SUBJECT: INDIA WILL NOT SUPPORT USG POSITION ON GOLDSTONE REPORT 
REF: SECSTATE 106423 

Classified By: POLCOUNS Uzra Zeya for Reasons 1.4 (B, D) 

¶1. (C) PolCouns delivered reftel demarche on November 4 to Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) Joint Secretaries for UN Political (UNP) and UN Economic and Social (UNES) Divisions and emphasized the significance the USG would place on India's support for opposing a resolution based on the biased conclusions of the Goldstone report.  UNES Under Secretary Abhishek Verma told Poloff during a conversation later the same day that India will retain the same position as it held in Geneva (Read: India will vote in favor of the resolution proposed by the Arab Group, the NAM, and the African Group), explaining that official positions on such issues take a long time to change. 

¶2. (C) Comment:  India is likely to continue to vote along with Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) countries on issues related to the Middle East as it seeks to build up support for its candidacy for a non-permanent seat in the run up to October 2010 UN Security Council elections.  End Comment.
