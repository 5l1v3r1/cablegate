¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  In October 30 meetings with the 
Ambassador, newly-elected Indonesian legislative leaders 
expressed their commitment to working with the U.S. to 
achieve Comprehensive Partnership goals.  They discussed 
Afghanistan, climate change, education and other key issues 
of mutual interest.  Legislators also asked that the U.S. 
send more official U.S. visitors to Indonesia.  Vigorous 
early engagement of Parliament is essential given that 75 
percent of legislators are new.  END SUMMARY. 
 
ENGAGING NEW LEGISLATIVE LEADERS 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Ambassador met with Indonesia's new legislative 
leaders on key components of our bilateral relationship on 
October 30.  In separate meetings, Taufik Kiemas, 
newly-elected Speaker of Indonesia's People's Consultative 
Assembly (MPR), and newly-elected political party leaders in 
the House of Representatives (DPR) expressed their commitment 
to working with the U.S. on Comprehensive Partnership goals. 
Kiemas thanked the Ambassador for U.S. support of Indonesia's 
G-20 membership.  He and other legislators outlined some of 
the Parliament's legislative priorities including combating 
illegal logging and climate change, better disaster 
management, improving health and education, and legislative 
capacity-building through training and increased 
accountability. 
 
KEY ISSUES ON BILATERAL AGENDA 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Legislative leaders explained that Indonesia is 
still trying to determine what its role should be regionally 
and internationally.  They confirmed that Indonesia wanted to 
help regarding Afghanistan, describing Indonesia's current 
efforts, which included small-scale Canadian-sponsored 
training programs planned for Afghan police and the 
possibility that Indonesia could provide training for Afghan 
judges.  The Ambassador noted as evidence of Indonesia's 
productive role internationally its peacekeeping units in 
Lebanon and Darfur, its training of Palestinian diplomats, 
and the GOI's successful efforts to release Korean aid 
workers in Afghanistan two years ago.  Indonesia and 
Afghanistan should work together on ways to build capacity 
and the U.S. stands willing to help that process, the 
Ambassador stated. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The legislators also asked for continued 
cooperation on climate change.  Noting President Yudhoyono's 
commitment to cut emissions by 26 percent from a 
business-as-usual scenario, the Ambassador emphasized the 
importance of the U.S. and Indonesia continuing to work 
together on this issue.  On education, legislators asked for 
more student scholarships to the U.S.  They were pleased to 
hear of our new Fulbright agreement, the U.S. plan to double 
the number of Indonesian students going to the U.S., and 
plans to fund U.S.-Indonesia university partnerships. 
 
 
MORE U.S. VISITORS, PLEASE 
 
¶6.  (U) The legislators asked for more visits from their 
Congressional counterparts and others in the U.S. government. 
 In particular, they are eagerly awaiting a visit from 
President Obama as further proof of our commitment to advance 
U.S.-Indonesia relations.  The Ambassador noted that 
meanwhile Indonesia's G-20 membership provides more 
opportunities for interaction between our Presidents.  In the 
meantime, President Obama and President Yudhoyono were 
scheduled to meet on the margins of the upcoming APEC 
discussions in Singapore.  Overall, the Ambassador concluded, 
we strongly support the development of a strong Indonesian 
legislative branch and look forward to working with it on 
ways to advance bilateral relations.
