¶2. (SBU) SUMMARY: Engagement with the GOI on counternarcotics 
remains a high Mission priority.  On October 23, the DCM met 
with Indonesian National Narcotics Board (BNN) officials to 
discuss the new GOI narcotics law and ongoing GOI-USG 
narcotics cooperation.  Close and long-standing cooperation 
between Indonesia and a cohesive Mission interagency group 
helped shape the new legislation, primarily through the Joint 
Interagency Counter Drug Operations Center (JIACDOC).   The 
DCM,s participation in the closing ceremony of a joint 
training session underscored the U.S. commitment to continued 
cooperation and assistance.  END SUMMARY. 
 
NEW LEGISLATION 
 
¶3. (SBU) At their October 23 meeting, the DCM and BNN/JIACDOC 
officials, including BNN Executive Director Brigadier General 
(Ret.) Jeanne Mandagi and JIACDOC Director Police Brigadier 
General Tommy Sagiman discussed the new narcotics 
legislation.  The new law established BNN as an independent 
law enforcement agency with expanded investigative powers, 
including direct engagement with prosecutors to initiate 
prosecutions and the authority to conduct wiretapping 
(reftel).  Although BNN,s proposed organizational structure 
remains to be approved, Mandagi noted to the DCM that BNN 
will need to train hundreds of new investigators pursuant to 
the new legislation.  A USG interagency cooperative group is 
poised to assist. 
 
ROBUST USG INTERAGENCY COOPERATION 
 
¶4. (SBU) In the six years leading up to this legislation, BNN 
worked closely with several U.S. agencies--primarily the U.S. 
Department of Justice Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), 
which is supported and funded by the DOD Joint Interagency 
Task Force West (JIATF-West) and has the lead on GOI-USG 
narcotics cooperation.  DEA and JIATF-West closely coordinate 
with the Country Team to carry out coherent and focused 
counternarcotics engagement with the GOI, usually in the form 
of training, training infrastructure support, establishment 
of intelligence fusion centers, and intelligence support. 
 
¶5. (SBU) The Bureau for International Narcotics and Law 
Enforcement Affairs (INL) coordinates with DEA on the 
implementation of strategic counternarcotics policy.  The 
Bureau of Diplomatic Security Office of Anti-Terrorism 
Assistance (DS/ATA), which is partially funded by the Office 
of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism (S/CT) cooperates 
with JIATF West on police investigative procedure training 
designed to reinforce rule of law within the Indonesian law 
enforcement community.  JIATF West supports the U.S. 
Department of Justice International Criminal Investigative 
Assistance Program (ICITAP) in Indonesia, which is primarily 
funded by INL, by providing training and support of training 
infrastructure development to complement the nascent BNN 
portion of ICITAP,s robust marine police law enforcement 
program.  As part of the DEA-JIATF partnership in Indonesia, 
JIATF West is currently funding the DEA position in Jakarta 
and providing an intelligence analyst to support the DEA 
position. 
 
NATIONAL ACADEMY 
 
¶6. (SBU) The DCM noted that the establishment of the national 
narcotics academy in Lido, Sukabumi, West Java was a good 
example of joint endeavors between the two governments. 
Mandagi agreed that the academy is part of a long history of 
GOI-USG cooperation in the close counternarcotics 
partnership.  BNN requested USG assistance to meet the 
training needs stemming from the new narcotics law and BNN,s 
expanded law enforcement authority.  DEA and JIATF-West have 
worked hand-in-hand with BNN on the academy's establishment. 
The academy is expected to open in 2010 (construction is 
scheduled to begin in November) and will eventually evolve

into a regional counterdrug center that will benefit 
Indonesian interagency and regional partners. 
 
JOINT INTERAGENCY COUNTER DRUG OPS CENTER (JIACDOC) 
 
¶7. (SBU) DEA, with support and funding from JIATF-West, has 
sponsored a fusion center network for the BNN since 2004. 
The Joint Interagency Counter Drug Operations Center 
(JIACDOC) is an Indonesian interagency intelligence and 
operations center focused on counternarcotics and 
transnational crime intelligence collection and interdiction. 
 It is jointly staffed by the Indonesian National Police, 
Indonesian Customs, Indonesian Immigration and other 
Indonesian government organizations. 
 
¶8. (SBU) The DCM attended the closing ceremony of a DS/ATA 
Proactive Internet Investigation course held at JIACDOC as 
part of his October 23 schedule.  The DCM encouraged the 
class of Indonesian Cyber Investigators to share what they 
accomplished in the training with other members of their 
units and to put what they have learned into practice.  The 
DS/ATA-sponsored instructor reported that one of the course's 
exercises resulted in a potential investigation, and the DCM 
noted that it was likely that future work by one, if not 
more, of the investigators would result in the saving of a 
number of lives. 
 
¶9. (SBU) July 2007 legislation officially recognized the 
JIACDOC as part of the organizational structure of BNN. Seven 
JIACDOC outstations were established at key airports and 
seaports to provide BNN and its interagency partners with a 
criminal information management network to consolidate 
information collection, investigations, and enforcement 
operations from the national to local level. The JIACDOC is 
equipped with a computer-based training classroom where the 
U.S. and GOI partners have conducted numerous courses. 
 
¶10. (SBU) The close cooperation that DEA, JIATF-West, and 
other USG agencies and offices, have forged with the 
Indonesian National Narcotics Board is a solid example of 
U.S. best practices for interagency cooperation in action. 
The results, both immediate and long-term, have strengthened 
the GOI-USG relationship.
