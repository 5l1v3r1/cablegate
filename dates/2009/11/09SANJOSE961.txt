¶1. (SBU) Costa Rica's March 18 re-establishment of full diplomatic 
relations with Cuba (Ref B) has progressed slowly. Costa Rica has 
named JosC) MarC-a Penabad LC3pez as the new ambassador to Cuba and 
has converted its consulate into an embassy.  The Castro 
government, however, has not yet named an ambassador or officially 
established its embassy in San Jose.  The upgraded relationship may 
temper Costa Rica's public criticism of Cuba, but any bilateral 
thaw will be slow: the two countries and systems of government are 
simply too different to move quickly. Suspending Title III of the 
Libertad Act in regard to Costa Rica thus remains in the U.S. 
national interest, especially if we wish to encourage the GOCR to 
use its upgraded ties for Arias' stated intent: to establish a 
"direct and open dialogue" which could positively influence the 
Castro regime. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The following answers are keyed to Ref A questions: 
 
Costa Rica has traditionally been a strong critic of the Cuban 
government. The recent re-establishment of diplomatic relations 
between Costa Rica and Cuba has brought with it a lull in outspoken 
calls for democratic development in Cuba, as the GOCR has yet to 
use its new relationship to promote the promised "dialogue" on 
democratic change with Cuba. 
 
-- Costa Rica has not made official statements condemning the Cuban 
government in the past six months. 
 
-- There have been no high-level diplomatic visits between Costa 
Rica and Cuba in the last six months. Costa Rica converted its 
consulate in Miramar, Cuba into an embassy and named JosC) MarC-a 
Penabad LC3pez as the new Ambassador on September 27, 2009. Penabad 
is a journalist and veteran diplomat who had previously served as 
Costa Rican Ambassador to Portugal from 1995-1998, and had been 
serving as Consul General in Cuba since 2003.  Cuba currently 
maintains a consulate in San JosC) and is expected to establish an 
embassy in the future. 
 
-- Post is not aware of any major Costa Rican business investments 
in Cuba. However, a number of Costa Rican businesses import cigars 
from Cuba and repackage them. In addition, Costa Rican tourists 
regularly visit Cuba and vice versa. 
 
-- Post is not aware of any bilateral trade agreements between 
Costa Rica and Cuba. 
 
-- There are a small number of exchange programs between Costa Rica 
and Cuba. A limited number of Costa Rican students have accepted 
scholarships to study medicine and film in Cuba, but we are not 
aware of any formal exchange or scholarship programs between Cuban 
and Costa Rican universities.
