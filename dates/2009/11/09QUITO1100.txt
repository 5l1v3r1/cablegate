REF: STATE 114855 
 
¶1.       In response to reftel demarche request, Post contacted 
AGROCALIDAD, the Ecuadorian agency in charge of sanitary and 
phytosanitary matters, to discuss the upcoming Inter-American 
Institute for Cooperation on Agriculture meeting in Santiago, Chile 
on the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety.  In the past,   AGROCALIDAD 
has represented the GoE at these meetings.  However, we were told 
that the Environment Ministry will be responsible for future 
discussions on  the Cartagena Protocol.  Since the Environment 
Ministry has as not yet assigned anyone to this portfolio, the GoE 
will not be sending any representative to the IICA meeting. 
 
 
 
¶2.       Post will follow up with both AGROCALIDAD and the 
Environment Ministry to determine who will attend the February 2010 
meeting in Kula Lumpur of the Group of the Friends of the Co-Chairs 
Concerning Liability and Redress in the Context of the Cartagena 
Protocol on Biosafety.
