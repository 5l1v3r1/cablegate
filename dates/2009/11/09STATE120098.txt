SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSES 050200863 AND GC-189609 
 
REF: 09 SAN SALVADOR 126 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on licenses 050200863 and GC-189609 for 
the export of revolvers to Nicaragua.  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request:  A previous Blue Lantern in El 
Salvador found that a Salvadoran company was engaging in a 
swap agreement with the Salvadoran Policia Nacional Civil 
(PNC) in which the PNC was provided new firearms in exchange 
for old revolvers.  The Salvadoran company stated that they 
had re-exported many of these old revolvers to Armeria Magnum 
of Nicaragua without prior authorization from the Department 
(REFTEL) (NOTE: GC-189609 is the Salvadoran company's post 
facto request for re-export authorization, which was 
ultimately granted. END NOTE).  This check is to obtain 
further information on these transactions, establish the bona 
fides of Armeria Magnum, and determine the company's annual 
firearms sales. 
 
¶4. Action Request: Post is requested to establish the bona 
fides of these transactions and end-user Armeria Magnum by 
making inquiries to representatives of the company and 
appropriate authorities of the Government of Nicaragua.  The 
following points are included for guidance: 
 
(To Armeria Magnum) 
 
--What products and services does your company provide?  Who 
are your regular customers and where do they reside? 
 
--What are your annual sales of U.S.-origin firearms?  Who 
are your customers for these firearms? 
 
--In the past, you purchased U.S.-origin firearms from 
companies in third countries.  Is this a common practice for 
Armeria Magnum?  Who are your third country suppliers of 
U.S.-origin firearms? 
 
--What quantities of U.S.-origin firearms do you generally 
import every year?  What percentage of these firearms come 
from third countries? 
 
--What is your relationship with Centrum S.A. of El Salvador? 
 How often do you purchase defense articles from the company? 
 How do you generally pay for these items? 
 
--Do you have any relationship to Gun Depot and/or Ricardo 
Alfonso Umana Luna of Guatemala?  If so, please describe this 
relationship. 
 
--Do you sell firearms to customers that reside outside 
Nicaragua?  If so, who are these customers and where do they 
reside? 
 
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing the import 
of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on 
re-transfer or re-export? 
 
(To Appropriate Import/Export and/or Law Enforcement 
Authorities) 
 
--Is Armeria Magnum properly authorized to import and sell 
defense articles in Nicaragua? 
 
--Do you have any information on Armeria Magnum that would 
call in to question their reliability as a recipient of U.S. 
defense articles? 
 
In its reply, Post may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to these transactions such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
