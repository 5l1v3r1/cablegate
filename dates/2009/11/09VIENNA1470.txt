¶1. (SBU) Polchief discussed reftel points November 18 with 
Bernhard Zimburg, MFA Director for East Asia and the Pacific, 
and his deputy, Bruno Bilek.  Zimburg said the GOA supports 
the USG's priorities for the new Afghan Government.  The GOA 
agrees on the need to work with President Karzai, despite the 
problems of the election.  According to GOA sources, Zimburg 
said, Karzai has more support among the Afghan population 
than Dr. Abdullah, and would have won in a second round. 
Both sides in the election committed fraud, though the media 
only focused on allegations against the Karzai campaign, he 
said. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Zimburg added that the GOA has long advocated the 
"Afghanization" of the mission, and therefore supports USG 
efforts to bolster Afghanistan's security forces, political 
system, and economic development.  He maintained that it 
could take "two generations" to establish a decent, stable 
society in Afghanistan.  Young Afghans should be encouraged 
to re-evaluate traditional views on matters like gender 
equality.  The international community will need to remain 
engaged throughout the process, but at a much reduced level 
than at present.  Success will depend on the ability to find 
suitable Afghan partners who can take over the leading roles, 
he said.
