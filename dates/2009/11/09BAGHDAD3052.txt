SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR AND MINISTER OF FINANCE SIGN MOU ON USG 
ASSISTANCE 
 
(SBU) Ambassador Hill and Minister of Finance Jabr signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding on the Implementation of Certain 
Protections for Assistance Projects on November 14, 2009. The 
MOU affords items imported for USG assistance projects 
necessary exemptions from Iraqi taxes, tariffs, and customs 
fees while we await Council of Representatives action on the 
long-pending Agreement on Technical and Economic Cooperation 
(commonly referred to as the Bilateral Assistance Agreement). 
Since the expiration on January 1, 2009 of the original CPA 
order exempting assistance from such taxes, the Embassy has 
expended considerable time and effort dislodging assistance 
materials from customs authorities.  Most immediately, 
implementation of the MOU will permit the release of $250,000 
in medical equipment donated by Project Hope to the Basrah 
Children's Hospital, water treatment pipes to benefit the 
citizens of Sadr City, and materials necessary for the 
completion of numerous other projects.
