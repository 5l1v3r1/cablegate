SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-SHIPMENT END-USE CHECK (ITRES 
RESEARCH) 
 
REF: 2009 STATE 58613 
 
¶1.   (SBU) In response to Reftel, post conducted a site visit to 
the facilities of ITRES Research, the subject of this Blue 
Lantern request, on October 23, 2009. 
 
¶2. (SBU) NOTE: This license request may be overcome by events as 
company representatives tell post that they have determined that 
they do not require a license for the equipment they acquired, 
and have therefore been in touch with the licensing authority to 
withdraw the application (see para 7).  Post will nevertheless 
share all pertinent information pursuant to his Blue Lantern 
request for the file, and/or for use with future inquiries or 
license applications.  End Note.

Nature of Business 
------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) ITRES Research is a well-established corporation in 
Calgary, Alberta, Canada, in the business of building and 
selling high-tech optic sensors for electronic mapping.  They 
build thermal optic sensors to mount on, or in, the belly of 
slow-flying airplanes with sensors to feed collected data 
electronically to computers for planning land use.  ITRES 
Research sells both the device housing and the computer analysis 
service for gathered mapping data.  ITRES Research has been in 
business for over 40 years, and has roughly 35 full-time 
employees. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Post met with the following ITRES representatives: 
Doug Davison, ITRES President and CEO; Tyme Witte brood, 
Director of Project Management and Finance; and JoAnne DeVries, 
Export Control Manager.  The company's contact information 
follows:

Typical Customers/Client Base; Planned End Use 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶5. (SBU) Past clients have included: the U.S. Army Corps of 
Engineers (used with construction of water barriers in 
Mississippi and Louisiana following Hurricane Katrina); several 
U.S. Army bases using their services to detect heat loss; and 
U.S.-based Tuck Mapping.  Davison estimates that approximately 
35 to 40 percent of their client base is in the U.S. with other 
work in Europe, specifically in Spain and France, and some in 
Japan. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
Storage, Possession, and Restrictions on Re-Export 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶6. (SBU) ITRES Research has a secure storage facility and 
laboratory space in a professional research park in Calgary, 
with 24-hour security.  ITRES has also appointed an employee to 
follow licensing processes full-time to ensure they are in 
compliance with various applicable regulations.  In instances 
where equipment is used in European or Japanese environments, 
Davison reports that ITRES obtains advance permission from 
Canadian Federal Authorities (DFAIT) in Ottawa. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
COMMENT: License Application Withdrawn in July 2009 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶7. (SBU) Davison and IRES Export Controls Manager JoAnn DeVries 
told post that although they filed an application for 
importation under United States Munitions List (USML) in January 
2009, after consulting with a specialist in such matters, they 
have determined that the items they plan to import are not 
governed by the USML.  Ms. DeVries reports that ITRES has 
therefore withdrawn its application on July 7, 2009 and has 
provided full documentation to the licensing authority in this 
regard. Nevertheless, post notes that this is a well-established 
company with an interest in long-term importation and use, with 
professional secure facilities and a long-standing contractor 
relationship with the U.S. military.  The fact that they have 
assigned an employee to manage such matters full time signifies 
a seriousness and professionalism, and post concludes that ITRES 
Research would be a reliable steward of any equipment listed on 
the USML.
