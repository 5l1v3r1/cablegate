Â¶1.  (SBU) POLOFF delivered Ref. non-paper November 13 to Cosmin 
Onisii, Director, U.S. and Canada Division.  Onisii appreciated the 
timely delivery and noted that he would incorporate the talking 
points into the Romanian Foreign Minister's brief.  Onisii provided 
no substantive feedback on the talking points, rather conversation 
again centered on building rapport and establishing a framework for 
future collaboration.
