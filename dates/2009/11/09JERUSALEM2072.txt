¶1. (U) Summary.  Trade Development Agency (TDA) Regional 
Director Carl Kress visited Jerusalem and the West Bank 
November 10-12 to follow up on pending grants for the MENA 
Geothermal and Rawabi (reftel) projects, generate interest in 
the TDA-sponsored May 2010 MENA Energy Conference in Cairo, 
and explore potential projects in the energy and IT sectors. 
End Summary. 
 
Geothermal and Rawabi IT Projects On Track 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) TDA and MENA Geothermal are planning an early 
December signing ceremony for a nearly $440,000 TDA grant 
(pending congressional notification) for a feasibility study 
for a geothermal heating and cooling system.  The resulting 
system design will be replicable in similar projects in the 
West Bank and elsewhere in the Middle East, and is expected 
to generate exports of US equipment. 
 
¶3. (U) Work is also proceeding on schedule for two potential 
projects at the Rawabi housing project, north of Ramallah. 
TDA contractors started work in November on proposals for an 
information technology network feasibility study and a 
wastewater treatment study.  Rawabi developer Bashar Masri 
called TDA assistance the first tangible USG assistance 
project at Rawabi. 
 
Energy Sector Seeks U.S. Private Sector Investment 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Contacts from the Jerusalem District Electric 
Company (JDECO) and the Palestinian Energy and Natural 
Resources Authority noted the absence of U.S. commercial 
involvement and USG assistance in the Palestinian energy 
sector, and urged TDA to help encourage U.S. investment. 
JDECO Chairman Youssef Dajani said that his priorities 
include a solar plant in Jericho, "smart grid" technology, 
energy efficiency through standardization of equipment, and 
fraud detection.  He estimated that JDECO, which distributes 
electricity to the central West Bank, including Ramallah and 
Jericho, loses USD 20 million annually due to fraud.  The 
problem, he said, is particularly acute in the 12 refugee 
camps to which JDECO provides services.  Dajani agreed to 
work with TDA to develop proposals for presentation to U.S. 
and regional companies at the TDA-sponsored May energy 
conference in Cairo.  He suggested including interconnection 
with neighboring countries, power control at future 
industrial zones, and methane gas generation. 
 
GPC Reviewing Proposal for TDA Assistance 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) General Petroleum Corporation (GPC), a subsidiary of 
the Palestinian Authority (PA) Ministry of Finance, is 
reviewing the proposal for TDA-funded technical assistance 
and an infrastructure study to upgrade its storage facilities 
and distribution network.  GPC Director General Amin Bashir 
said he had briefed Prime Minister Fayyad (who, as Minister 
of Finance, is responsible for GPC) on the assistance 
proposal and received his support to proceed.  He noted that 
Fayyad has asked that the GPC submit its two-year plan in a 
month's time, and he hoped to include the TDA proposal as a 
component. 
 
¶6. (U) Comment: Post is deeply appreciative of TDA's efforts 
to support broader West Bank economic development 
initiatives, and to generate concepts that complement ongoing 
USAID, OPIC, and other USG programming.  TDA's projects 
continue to be well received by the PA and the local business 
community.
