SUBJECT: NOVEMBER 5 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: MILITARIZATION OF SPACE, 
CLIMATE CHANGE, GULF OF ADEN. 
 
¶1. Key points at the November 5 MFA press briefing: 
 
-- China's position on the militarization of outer space remains 
unchanged.  China opposes the militarization of outer space and will 
not engage in any arms race in outer space. 
 
-- China will continue to take "effective measures" to combat 
climate change. However, developed nations have an obligation to 
take the lead on this issue. 
 
-- China maintains a "positive and open attitude" towards bilateral 
and multilateral cooperation to secure the Gulf of Aden and the seas 
off Somalia.  Representatives from navies participating in 
anti-piracy efforts will hold a multilateral conference in the near 
future. 
 
-- China welcomes the further development of bilateral relations 
with North Korea and supports the resumption of the Six-Party 
Talks. 
 
NO ARMS RACE IN SPACE 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. At the November 5 regularly scheduled Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
press conference, spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu stated that China's 
position on the militarization of space remains unchanged.  In 
response to a question about comments attributed to Xu Qiliang, a 
senior PLA Air Force official, implying that an arms race in space 
is inevitable, Ma said that China continues to oppose the 
militarization of outer space and will not participate in any sort 
of "arms race" in outer space. 
 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
--------------- 
 
¶3.  Developed countries have a "historical responsibility" to take 
the lead on climate change issues by providing capital, technology, 
and other support to developing countries.  This is the "common 
consensus" of the international community, said Ma.  Given that the 
United States and China's level of economic development is not the 
same, the two countries' respective obligations are also not the 
same.  In fact, all developed and developing countries have "common 
but differentiated" obligations towards climate change. 
 
¶4.  China is taking "proper actions" to reduce emissions "by a large 
margin," Ma said, and will continue to take effective measures 
against climate change.  On this issue, China's attitude is serious, 
its goals are clear, and its measures are effective. 
 
GULF OF ADEN 
------------ 
 
¶5.  Ma stated that according to information from the Ministry of 
National Defense, China will hold meetings to discuss safeguarding 
the waters off Somalia.  Navy representatives from Russia, Japan, 
India, the EU, and other countries as well as NATO will attend a 
conference in early November.  China maintains a "positive and open 
attitude" towards bilateral and multilateral cooperation to secure 
the Gulf of Aden and the waters off Somalia. 
 
 
BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶6.  Although "not aware of any specifics" about meetings between PRC 
and DPRK officials, Ma stated that China welcomes the development of 
China's bilateral relationship with the DPRK and supports the 
resumption of the Six-Party Talks. 
 
SIXTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PLA AIR FORCE 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶7.  Foreign journalists will have an opportunity to cover "relevant 
activities" during the sixtieth anniversary of the establishment of 
the PLA Air Force.  Ma said specific questions should be raised with 
the Ministry of National Defense. 
 
BACHELET VISIT 
---------------- 
 
¶8.  Michelle Bachelet, the President of the Republic of Chile, will 
make a "working visit" to Shanghai on November 12-13.  Ma also 
welcomed officials from the Hong Kong SAR and countries in Oceania, 
who were present at the briefing.

of President Barack Obama to China, Ma answered that relevant 
announcements would be made "in due course." 
 
TIBET HYDROPOWER PROJECT 
------------------------ 
 
¶10. When asked about a proposed hydroelectric project in Tibet, Ma 
responded that China is a "responsible country" and asked the 
reporter to refer to more detailed information on the MFA website.
