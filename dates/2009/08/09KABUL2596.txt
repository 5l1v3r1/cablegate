SUBJECT: PRIMER ON IEC AND ECC ROLES IN COUNTING AND 
REVIEW OF IRREGULARITIES 
 
REF:  KABUL 
 
¶1. (SBU) The tally process is moving forward to the provisional 
results stage and a formal complaints period.  This is a primer on 
Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) and Electoral Complaints 
Commission (ECC) roles. 
 
IEC Role 
------- 
¶2. Most tally sheets for both Presidential and Provincial Council 
elections in tamper-evident bags (TEBs) have arrived at the 
Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) headquarters from provinces 
around the country.  By August 28, we expect over 90 percent of the 
TEBs will be in Kabul.  IEC officials in the Tally Center are 
working around the clock to process the tally sheets, conduct 
initial screening, and tally the results.  The IEC has investigation 
and audit teams reviewing results from polling centers that have 
either sent in questionable TEBs or which have had past problems. 
At this stage, the IEC may quarantine materials for further 
investigation and/or disqualify ballots if it identifies fraud.  The 
entire process takes place in the presence of observers. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) After the day's preliminary results are entered at the 
Tally Center in Kabul, they are approved by the IEC Board of 
Commissioners and announced at the IEC Media Center on a cumulative 
rolling basis as they are available and until the process is 
complete.  In addition, preliminary results should be posted on the 
IEC website,  and updated every 24 hours (Note:  The IEC has been 
slow to post information previously announced at its August 25 and 
August 26 press conferences and has posted nothing following its 
unexplained cancellation of today's press conference.  End note.) 
 
¶4. (SBU) The partial preliminary presidential election results 
announced each day come from a variety of provinces, though by no 
means a scientifically sampled cross-section.  These partial results 
are formatted for presentation by province and by candidate. 
Provincial Council election preliminary results will be announced 
when Provincial Council results for all polling stations in a 
constituency have been approved by the IEC. 
Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) Role 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶5.  (SBU) All results are preliminary until the ECC completes 
investigations and adjudicates each complaint.  These continue to 
arrive at the ECC headquarters in Kabul.  A complaint must be filed 
within 72 hours of the incident.  The ECC has the authority to 
exclude or include ballots in the count, sanction offenders, and 
order re-polling of elections.  All ECC decisions are final and it 
has the authority to overrule the IEC. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) As reported in Kabul 2480, the ECC has emphasized that the 
September 17 target date for IEC final certification of results is 
not firm, as the ECC may need additional time to thoroughly 
investigate and resolve complaints.  The IEC can only certify and 
announce final election results once the ECC has made a decision on 
all complaints that are filed within the allowed time frame. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Embassy Kabul's Elections Team is confident in the ECC's 
technical aptitude and its ability to exercise its authority.  The 
Elections Team remains engaged with the ECC on a daily basis to 
provide support as needed in a low-profile manner.  Support may 
include assistance with travel to provinces, prioritization of 
complaints, and data collection and analysis. 
Schedule 
-------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Approximate results announcement schedule: 
-- Aug 25-Sep 3:  Daily partial preliminary results reporting from 
the IEC, until complete (Note:  Today the IEC announced that no 
press conferences will be held on August 27 or 28.  End note). 
-- Sept 17-23:  Final certified results expected from the IEC, 
dependent on completion of ECC work 
-- Approximately Oct 10:  Inauguration (if first round only)
