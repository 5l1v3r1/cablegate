SUBJECT: BRAZIL H1N1 UPDATE - AUGUST 2009 
 
(U) THIS MESSAGE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED AND NOT FOR INTERNET 
DISTRIBUTION.  PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) This report provides an update on developments in Brazil 
regarding the H1N1 flu outbreak. 
 
OVERALL SITUATION 
 
¶2.  (SBU) H1N1 flu has caused a considerable amount of concern among 
the Brazilian population.  Doctors anecdotally report that their 
patients are coming in for minor cold and allergy symptoms (which 
are exceedingly common during this time of year) fearing that they 
may have contracted H1N1 flu.  In general, doctors are performing an 
initial clinical screening, which eliminates the majority of suspect 
cases.  Those that are not eliminated by this screening have an 
actual flu test performed to concretely diagnose their case. 
Generally, hospitals and clinics will isolate a patient during the 
initial screening and in some cases until the results of the flu 
test are received.  According to the Ministry of Health, between 
April 25 and August 22 the results of 30,854 flu tests were reported 
by state and local health authorities.  Of these tests, 16.9% tested 
positive for H1N1, while 2.9% tested positive for seasonal flu.  The 
remaining cases were negative for any type of influenza. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) As of August 22 there have been 557 deaths in Brazil 
attributed to H1N1 flu.  This number has risen quickly in recent 
weeks; though the rapid increase is due to a clearing of the testing 
backlog rather than an increase in the infection rate.  According to 
the Ministry of Health the severity of H1N1 - based on the symptoms 
it causes, the severity to which the symptoms are felt, the 
frequency with which they appear, and the frequency with which 
hospitalization is required - in Brazil is statistically 
indistinguishable from the severity of the seasonal flu.  The 
Ministry's statistics also indicate that the rate of infection for 
both H1N1 and season flu is declining as the flu season is nearing 
an end. 
 
IMPACT ON AMCIT COMMUNITY AND THE U.S. MISSION 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In mid-July a member of the Mission's local guard force 
was diagnosed with a case of H1N1 flu.  Additionally, the American 
School of Brasilia (EAB) has temporarily suspended all of its fifth 
grade classes.  This action was undertaken after several students in 
the fifth grade were suspected of having cases of H1N1.  EAB is the 
school in which most of the Embassy children are enrolled.  In Sao 
Paulo many schools, including the three that Consulate children 
attend, delayed the resumption of classes following the July holiday 
break by up to two weeks as a preventative measure against the 
spread of H1N1.  Most classes resumed the week of August 17.
