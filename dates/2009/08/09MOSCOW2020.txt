SUBJECT:  EXBS RUSSIA MONTHLY REPORTING CABLE 
JULY 2009 
 
Summary:  This cable highlights activities of the Export Control and 
Related Border Security (EXBS) Russia Program Office for the period 
of July 01, 2009 to July 30, 2009.  End Summary 
 
¶1.  EXBS Russia staff contributed to President Obama's successful 
visit and related events in Moscow July 6-8.  Advisor Joan Agerholm 
worked in the control room of the Ritz-Carlton Hotel (where the 
Obama family stayed).  Assistant Konstantin Troyan and the EXBS Jeep 
were pressed into service as part of the motorcade that transported 
Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs William Burns to a 
memorial service for slain journalist Paul Klebnikov at Christ the 
Saviour Cathedral. 
 
¶2.  EXBS Russia has submitted its ideas and suggestions to the 
US-Russia Bilateral Commission announced by President Obama and 
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev on July 6th during the Moscow 
summit.  EXBS's program focus on export controls and border security 
was deemed most applicable to the goals of the Working Groups on 
Nuclear Energy and Nuclear Security, and on Drug Trafficking. 
 
¶3.  EXBS Russia obtained agreement from Russian Customs to move 
forward with a seminar on Supply Chain Security in Russia the week 
of September 14-18, and also to move forward with planning for an 
advanced training session for operators of Non-Intrusive Inspection 
(NII) equipment in Russia in November or December. 
 
¶4.  EXBS contractor Commonwealth Trading Partners (CTP), through its 
Russian partner, the Center for Export Controls (CEC), conducted its 
last export controls training in Russia under the current agreement. 
 The Internal Compliance Program (ICP) workshop held in Moscow July 
21-22 attracted approximately 20 industry representatives from 
Moscow and the regions.  Specialists from the Federal Service for 
Technical and Export Control (FSTEK), Russian Customs, the Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs, and CEC updated the audience on major Russian 
export controls laws and changes to those laws, as well as Russian 
government agencies' areas of responsibility in upholding export 
controls regulations.  The training consisted of two parts:  day one 
was devoted to Russian export rules and regulations; and day two 
consisted of hands-on computer work with the Product Identification 
tool (PIT).  In addition, the CTP representative gave a presentation 
about best practices for structuring and implementing an Internal 
Compliance Program in an exporting enterprise. 
 
¶5.  The staffs of EXBS and of the Law Enforcement Section (LES), 
within which EXBS is located, provided urgent assistance to the CTP 
contractor who participated in the two-day export controls seminar 
after she was injured in a car accident on her way back to the 
airport.  The contractor was examined by a Russian ambulance doctor 
at the scene and then transported to the European Medical Center. 
The embassy Medical Unit was consulted, as well.  No significant 
injuries were revealed, although the consensus was to delay her 
departure for the US by one day.  EXBS and LES staff worked quickly 
to change her flight, arrange for a hotel at the airport, work with 
the Foreign Ministry to extend her visa by one day (it was due to 
expire on the original date of departure).  The embassy team, led by 
LES chief Peter Prahar, took care of all the details quickly and 
efficiently so that this situation could be brought to a successful 
conclusion. 
 
¶5.  This office submitted travel, operating, housing, and FSN budget 
requirements to State for FY 2010.
