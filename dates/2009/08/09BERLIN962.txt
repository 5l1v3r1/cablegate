SUBJECT: H1N1 UPDATE: 8,619 CONFIRMED CASES 
 
REF:  A) Berlin 937, B) Berlin 925 and previous. 
 
¶1. (U)  SUMMARY: The number of H1N1 infections in Germany 
rose within the last two days by 1442 to a total of 8,619 on 
August 6. The majority of new infections occurred abroad. 
School began in several federal states despite an increase in 
H1N1 cases.  Berlin's preparations for the World Championships 
in Athletics include increased precautionary measures at 
Schoenefeld airport. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U)  On August 5, the National Reference Center for 
Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) confirmed 786 new 
(laboratory and non-laboratory) confirmed cases of H1N1, 
increasing the total number of H1N1 cases to 7,963.  On August 
6, RKI confirmed an additional 656 people to be infected with 
the new virus bringing the total number of confirmed H1N1 
cases in Germany to 8,619.   Within the two days, new cases 
were distributed among the federal states as follow:  North 
Rhine-Westphalia (484), Lower-Saxony (295), Baden-Wuerttemberg 
(179), Bavaria (167), Hesse (76), Schleswig-Holstein (38), 
Hamburg (33), Saarland (31), Rhineland-Palatinate Berlin (29), 
(28), Saxony-Anhalt (19), Thuringia (19), Brandenburg (18), 
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (16), Saxony (6) and Bremen (4). 
 
¶3. (U)  According to RKI, the increase in the number of 
infections is mainly due to people returning from travel 
abroad (1098 new cases).  Newly confirmed cases include 
laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 as well as non-laboratory- 
confirmed cases, mainly from people who displayed symptoms 
after being in contact with a patient who previously tested 
positive.  So far, all cases are reportedly mild. 
 
¶4. (U)  North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) remains the German state 
with the highest number of cases with a total of 3,266, 
followed by Lower-Saxony (1601) and Baden-Wuerttemberg (858 
cases).  Less than 22 percent (1,859) of all confirmed 
infections in Germany have resulted from domestic 
transmission. 
 
¶5. (U)  Media reports indicate that the Federal Cabinet will 
decide August 12 who receive the flu vaccination first. 
According to the current draft ordinance, people likely to be 
immunized first those who could get in contact with infected 
people such as firefighters, police officers and medical 
personal as well as high-risk groups such as people with 
existing health problems.  However, questions remain as to 
whether or not statutory health care agencies will cover the 
full cost for the immunization. The German Health Ministry's 
July announcement that the shot will be free; this has has led 
to a dispute with the statutory health care agencies. 
 
¶6. (U) The new school year began today in Bremen, Lower- 
Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. Media reports indicate 
that information brochures have been distributed to provide 
inform about the flu and the precautionary measure that should 
be considered to prevent its further spread.  The federal 
states of Hesse and Baden-Wuerttemberg are considering 
extending the summer break due to the new virus.  Schools in 
Hesse will officially start on August 24 while in Baden- 
Wuerttemberg students will go back to school mid- September. 
NRW announced it will decide mid next week whether to extend 
the summer break.

virus or other diseases.  The airport quarantine station can

accommodate up to 250 people and cost 100,000 Euro.  Media 
reports indicate that athletes with flu-like symptoms will 
most likely be put under quarantine at their hotel until test 
results become available.  There has been no similar 
announcement regarding quarantine measures at Berlin's main 
airport, Tegel.  To date, Berlin has a total of 217 confirmed
