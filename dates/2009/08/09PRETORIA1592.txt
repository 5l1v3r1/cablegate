(DICO), Directorate of the Horn of Africa and Indian Ocean Islands, 
Mr. Gabriel P. Setlhoke, Director.

the Office of Humanitarian Assistance was not available.  The 
meeting was cordial and Mr. Setlhoke was very engaging.  He 
expressed concern over the control of food delivered to Somalia, but 
also said that Kenya and Ethiopia have stable governments and thus 
should be able to take care of themselves.
