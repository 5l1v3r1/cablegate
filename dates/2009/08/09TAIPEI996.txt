¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY.  The estimated losses from Morakot 
continue to mount, suggesting this could be the most deadly 
weather-related disaster to hit Taiwan in fifty years. Relief 
and rebuilding efforts are gaining momentum.  The arrival 
here of supplies provided by DoD received wide media 
coverage.  USAID continues to monitor the situation on the 
ground in the worst-hit areas.  The Taiwan Red Cross has 
received significant donations from private sources, and is 
working to coordinate its relief efforts with more than 30 
local non-governmental organizations.  End Summary. 
 
---------------------- 
Human and Economic Toll 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The official death toll from Typhoon Morakot stands 
at 126 as of the afternoon of August 17.  61 individuals are 
reported missing and 45 injured.  Although media are 
reporting that an additional 491 individuals are confirmed 
dead in Xiaolin Village, which was destroyed by a mudslide, 
our contacts note that these deaths are still pending legal 
confirmation at the county level.  That said, confirmation is 
expected.  It will raise the final death toll from Morakot to 
well over 600, making this the most deadly weather-related 
disaster to hit Taiwan since 1959. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Agricultural losses are now estimated at over 
USD365 million, with USD82 million of that amount 
attributable to direct loss of agricultural land and 
equipment, with the balance coming from loss of agricultural 
products, particularly in aquaculture, poultry, and meat. 
Infrastructure costs continue to mount, as well, with road 
reconstruction making up the lion's share of the bill.  All 
national expressways are now repaired, with 93 provincial and 
county roads still in need of restoration.  The Directorate 
General of Highways estimates it will take two months to 
repair those roads.  The Taiwan Railway Administration 
reports that it will take six months to rebuild the bridge 
over the Taimali River and restore to 100 percent southern 
railway transportation.  Authorities continue to shy away 
from making estimates of total infrastructure repair costs as 
they plan to open much of this work to tender.  However, 
Premier Liu Chao-shiuan has stated that reconstruction budget 
requirements could reach USD3.3 billion, of which USD2.2 
billion would be used for major infrastructure projects and 
relief assistance.  The Ministry of Education (MOE) reports 
that over 1,300 schools have been damaged and 31 schools were 
completely destroyed.  MOE is arranging for alternative 
instruction for the roughly 1,600 students with nowhere to 
attend classes as the new school year approaches. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  There have been significant improvements in water 
supply, with 31,885 households still suffering from lack of 
access to potable water (down from nearly 1 million 
households at the end of last week).  An estimated 14,782 
households are still without power, and an additional 3,848 
are waiting for resumption of telecommunications services.  A 
total of 24,462 individuals were forced to evacuate their 
homes as a result of Morakot and over 5,000 are still staying 
in 53 shelters (many of the other evacuees were able to 
reside temporarily with family).

Relief Measures 
-------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU)  The Department of Defense, in support of the 
 
TAIPEI 00000996  002 OF 002 
 
 
Department of State, authorized U.S. Pacific Command to 
provide assistance to Taiwan in response to the typhoon. 
This response has taken the form of plastic sheeting, water 
purification tablets, and medium- and heavy-lift capable 
helicopters.  The plastic sheeting was delivered to Taiwan on 
August 16, and on August 17, a USMC C-130 landed at Tainan 
Airfield at 1225 and departed at 1302 after dropping off a 
pallet of 315,000 water purification tablets. A US Navy 
MD-53D from the USS Denver arrived at Tainan Airfield at 1425 
 to conduct a pre-operation survey.  However, the planned 
aerial survey was canceled due to weather.  Flight operations 
in support of Taiwan relief efforts are tentatively 
re-scheduled to commence tomorrow morning. 
 
¶6. (SBU)  USAID/OFDA Acting Regional Advisor Ron Libby 
arrived in Taiwan on the evening of August 14.  He met with 
AIT Acting Director Wang, viewed Taiwan's Central Disaster 
Operations Center, met with the Minister of Transportation 
and Communications, and with Secretary-General Chen of the 
Taiwan chapter of the Red Cross.  On August 16, Libby 
traveled to the south of Taiwan, where AIT/K staff 
accompanied him to meet with relief officials and view 
affected areas.  On August 17, Libby was able to have an 
aerial view (aboard a Taiwan helicopter) of affected areas 
and seven tentative drop-off points for relief efforts. 
According to AIT/K, the devastation viewed today exceeded 
what Libby expected.  It appears that use of USG resources to 
reach some remote areas affected by floods and mudslides is 
unlikely in the next 10 days.  The U.S. helicopters will be 
useful to ferry equipment into disaster areas to begin making 
access routes from both sides.  A longer-term solution may 
require expertise on stabilizing mountainsides.  Overall, 
Libby felt that Taiwan rescue and relief workers were doing a 
good job.  AIT expects the arrival of Mr. Alan Dwyer, 
Principal Regional Advisor for East Asia-Pacific, USAID/OFDA 
on August 19, to replace the departing Mr. Libby and continue 
providing assistance on relief operations. 
 
¶7. (SBU)  The Council of Labor Affairs (CLA) is offering a 
total of 112,000 temporary jobs in 45 affected towns and 
villages for a two-week period to assist in clean-up and 
reconstruction.  The wage offered is roughly USD3.10 per 
hour.  The authorities continue to offer low interest loans 
and cash payments to farmers and residents of affected areas 
to assist in reconstruction and repair.  The Executive Yuan 
(EY) is considering a proposal to offer allowances of roughly 
USD90 per month to typhoon victims, with a maximum of three 
eligible persons per household.  These allowances would last 
for one year.  Premier Liu has announced that the EY will 
cooperate with NGOs to jointly build houses for typhoon 
victims. 
 
¶8. (SBU)  Private donations have continued to pour into local 
organizations, and particularly the Red Cross.  NGOs around 
the island have told us that financial assistance at this 
time is more useful than material goods.  The Red Cross on 
August 19 will convene approximately 30 local NGOs to discuss 
further coordination of relief efforts, particularly the 
provision of services such as trauma counseling.  The 
American Club in Taipei has made a call for donations and 
held a silent auction to raise funds.  The American Chamber 
of Commerce in Taipei has also made a public appeal to its 
membership for donations, and set up a text-messaging system 
to make donations.
