(U) The Department´s Office of Defense Trade Controls Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post´s assistance in conducting a post-license/pre-shipment check on license XXXXXXXXXXXX for the export of firearms, components, and ammunition to Bulgaria.

¶4. (SBU) Action Prague: Post is requested to establish the bona fides of Kingfisher S.R.O. by making inquiries to representatives of the company and appropriate host government officials. Post is also requested to provide an assessment of the company´s suitability as a consignee of U.S. Munitions Listed defense articles. The following points are included for guidance:
(To Kingfisher S.R.O.)
--When was your company established and who are its principals? Does your company have offices located in other countries?
--What products and services does your company provide? Who are your regular customers and where do they reside?
--Will your company ever have physical possession of the defense articles listed on this export license? If so, what inventory procedures are in place to assure the proper security and safe delivery of these firearms?
--From whom will you receive the defense articles and to whom will you ship them? Please provide a brief chain of custody for these defense articles.
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing the import of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on re-transfer or re-export?
(To Czech Government)
--Is Kingfisher S.R.O. properly authorized to import and/or assist in the shipment of firearms?
--Does the company have proper authorizations to engage in this transaction for the shipment of firearms to Bulgaria?
--Do you have any information on Kingfisher S.R.O. that would question their reliability as a consignee of U.S. defense articles?

In its reply, Post is encouraged to comment on any information pertinent to this transaction such as security of facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.

¶5. (SBU) Action Oslo: Post is requested to establish the bona fides of Reidar Ostby and clarify its role in this transaction by making inquiries to representatives of the company and appropriate host government officials. The following points are included for guidance:
(To Reidar Ostby)
--When was your company established and who are its principals? Does your company have offices located in other countries?

--Please describe the role your company will play in this transaction. What specific services will your company be providing? What fees or commissions is your company receiving for these services and whom is paying them?
--Will your company ever have physical possession of the firearms listed on this export license? If so, what inventory procedures are in place to assure the proper security and safe delivery of these firearms?
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing the brokering of U.S.-origin defense articles, including the requirement for all brokers of U.S.-origin defense articles, regardless of nationality, to register with the U.S. Department of State?

(To Norwegian Government)
--Is Reidar Ostby properly authorized by the Government of Norway to import, export, or broker firearms?
