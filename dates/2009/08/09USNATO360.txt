20 Aug. 2009 
 
Statement by the Secretary General of NATO Afghan elections 
 
Today the world has been watching Afghanistan.  We have 
witnessed the first Afghan-led elections in thirty years; a 
testimony to the determination of the Afghan people to build 
democracy.  I want to congratulate the people of 
Afghanistan for the courage they have shown in spite of 
challenging circumstances. 
 
We have seen Afghanistan defying threats of intimidation and 
violence to exercise their democratic rights.  Seen 
from a security point of view, the elections today have been 
a success, not least thanks to the efforts of the 
Afghan National Security Forces. 
 
They have led security efforts and they should be applauded. 
They have done everything possible to make 
these elections as secure and as inclusive as possible.  So, 
all in all, the elections today have been conducted 
effectively.

¶3. (U) Below is a summary of the question and answer period 
provided by our Public Affairs office: 
 
Q: Low turnout? 
A: Premature to say anything regarding turnout, important 
that election seen as credible in the eyes of the Afghan 
people.  Situation better than expected. 
 
Q: Recent violence, die down after election? 
A: Knew in advance enemies of Afghanistan would try to block 
elections through terror attacks, not a surprise. 
Security point of view, situation much better than could have 
been expected.  No one know what will come but urge 
all candidates to handle outcome in a responsible manner. 
 
Q: What if winners do not share NATO's view on how to proceed? 
A: Met leading candidates recently and all assured me of 
willingness to coop after elections, embark on 
reconciliation process which is way forward.
