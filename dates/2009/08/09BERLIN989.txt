¶1. (U)  SUMMARY: The number of confirmed H1N1 infections in 
Germany increased by 445 new cases bringing the total as of 
August 12 to 10,600.  The majority of new infections occurred 
abroad and Germany's hospitals reported an increase in walk-in 
patients concerned that they may be H1N1 positive.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U)  At its August 12 press briefing, the National 
Reference Center for Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute 
(RKI) 
confirmed a total of 445 new H1N1 cases (laboratory and non- 
laboratory) in Germany over yesterday.  This increased the 
total number of H1N1 cases in Germany to 10,600.  New cases 
were distributed among the federal states as follows: North 
Rhine-Westphalia (160), Rhineland-Palatinate (67), Bavaria 
(50), Saarland (31), Hesse (30), Hamburg (28), Brandenburg 
(19), Saxony (17), Berlin (15), Thuringia (13), Saxony-Anhalt 
(8), Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (5) and Bremen (2). 
 
¶3. (U)  According to RKI, 345 of the 445 new cases are 
attributed to people returning from travel abroad.  New cases 
also include non-laboratory H1N1 cases from people who 
exhibited symptoms after being in contact with a laboratory 
confirmed infected person.  So far, all new cases are 
reportedly mild. 
 
¶4. (U)  North Rhine-Westphalia remains the German state with 
the highest number of confirmed virus cases with a total of 
3,876, followed by Lower-Saxony (1866) and Baden-Wuerttemberg 
(1014).  About 22 percent (2332) of all confirmed infections 
in Germany have resulted from domestic transmission.
