SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (08/03): Palestinians Decry East 
Jerusalem Home Evictions; Papers Note US Criticism 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
All front pages report on the eviction of two Palestinian families 
by Israeli authorities.  The two families (Hanoun and Al-Ghawi) were 
forcefully evicted from their homes in the East Jerusalem 
neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah on August 2.  Reports note local and 
international condemnation of the evictions, including by the 
Palestinian Authority (PA), UK, United Nations, and US.  Al-Ayyam 
runs a separate front page article noting the State Department's 
response to the evictions, while Al-Hayat Al-Jadida includes the US 
criticism as a sub-headline in its lead story. Dimitry Deliani, the 
Fatah spokesperson in Jerusalem, condemned the eviction as "ethnic 
cleansing." The Chief Negotiator for the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization (PLO), Saeb Erikat, stated that Israel is ignoring all 
international laws and human rights in committing these actions. 
 
All dailies front page news that the Sixth Fatah Party Congress will 
commence in Bethlehem on August 4.  The dailies report that 
mediation efforts with Hamas to allow Fatah members resident in Gaza 
to attend the conference have thus far failed.  Palestinian 
Authority President Mahmoud Abbas reportedly telephoned the head of 
the Egyptian Intelligence Service (EGIS) Omar Suleiman on August 2 
to discuss ways to convince Hamas to facilitate the participation of 
Fatah members in the conference. 
 
Al-Ayyam front pages a report that the Fatah political program that 
will be presented during the upcoming Congress will focus on its 
non-recognition of Israel as a "Jewish state" and its opposition to 
Israel's continued settlement activities.  The program also notes 
that Fatah perceives a "comprehensive and just peace with the 
Israelis as a strategic choice." 
 
All dailies run front page news on Israel's reaction to statements 
made by British diplomat Martin Day to Al-Arabiya TV on July 22 that 
the British Government is sponsoring urban planning projects in East 
Jerusalem.  The reports note that Israel is seeking "clarifications" 
from London regarding Day's statements.  An Israeli official is 
quoted saying "we wonder how a democratic country sponsors political 
activities in another democratic country; we are awaiting answers 
from British officials." 
 
Al-Quds runs a front page report that according to the Palestinian 
Bureau of Statistics, by the end of 2008 the number of settlers in 
the West Bank had surpassed half a million, residing in 440 discreet 
settlements and outposts throughout the West Bank. 
 
All dailies report on the Arab League's denial that it has received 
messages from the US administration requesting its member states to 
take initiatives towards normalizing relations with Israel as a 
means to facilitate US pressure on Israel.

Sunday, August 2: 
 
Khaled Mesh'al, the head of the Hamas political bureau, reportedly 
stated that Turkey and Russia had contacted Hamas to request that 
Fatah members resident in the Gaza Strip be permitted to participate 
in the Sixth Party Congress, but noted that these contacts did not 
"rise to the level of mediation."  Mesh'al stressed in statements to 
 
JERUSALEM 00001333  002 OF 003 
 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
the Egyptian newspaper Al Ahram that all mediation between Hamas and 
Fatah is handled exclusively by Egypt. 
 
Al Quds, Al Ayyam, and Al Hayat report on the speech by Palestinian 
Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad at the conference "Jerusalem: 
History of the Future," at Birzeit University.  Fayyad stated that 
the future of the Palestinian national project and comprehensive 
peace in the region depend on protecting the status of Jerusalem and 
its history, and on a solution guaranteeing the rights of 
Palestinians in the city.  Fayyad also announced also that the 
Palestinian Authority is finalizing a document entitled "Palestine: 
Ending the Occupation and Establishing the State."  According to 
Fayyad, this document will set forth principles of governance and 
leadership in support of an independent Palestinian state. 
 
Al Quds, Al Ayyam, and Al Hayat Al Jadida report on Saudi Arabia's 
refusal to take initiatives to normalize relations with Israel, 
demanding that Israel first provide evidence of its seriousness 
regarding the peace process.  Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs 
Prince Saud Al-Faisal, in a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton in Washington, focused on the need to address all 
the core issues such as the Palestinian state and refugees.  During 
the joint press conference the Saudi Foreign Minister stated that 
"the real question is what Israel is going to give in return for a 
comprehensive offer," and that so far, Israel has not responded to 
President Obama's demand to stop settlement activities. 
 
Saturday, August 1: 
 
Al Quds and Al Ayyam report that Ismail Haniyyeh, the Hamas leader 
in Gaza, threatened to boycott the reconciliation talks scheduled 
with Fatah on August 25 in Egypt, "if political arrests and threats 
against Hamas movement leaders and members of the Legislative 
Council continue in the West Bank."  In a Friday sermon at a mosque 
in the Gaza Strip city of Rafah, Haniyyeh stated that "it is 
questionable whether the Hamas movement will participate at the next 
round of talks if the political arrests file is not closed and if 
threats to the movement's members and PLC representatives are not 
ended." Haniyyeh also criticized the call for presidential and 
legislative elections despite the "continuing siege, political 
arrests, and restrictions of movement on people and goods." 
 
Al Quds, Al Ayyam, and Al Hayat Al Jadida report that a number of 
senior U.S. Congress members will visit the Middle East next week in 
an attempt to reassure Israel of US backing.  ------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
1) Iyad Sarraj, Al-Quds, "Obama and the Palestinian Legislative 
Council members" (08/03):  "Obama is smart and courteous and this 
will assist him in reviving the peace process in the Middle East, if 
he supports tangible steps to encourage Hamas to finally begin 
negotiations, including the release of all PLC members from Israeli 
i 
jails.  Otherwise, the good intentions that Obama presented in his 
June 4 speech will vanish, as many expect, if not followed by 
actions." 
 
2) Azmi Khawaj, Al-Ayyam, "How long shall Israel remain above the 
law?" (08/03): "Everyone agrees that respecting international laws 
is the only mechanism that would allows a solution to regional

conflicts.  However, since 1948, Israel has been treated as a state 
above the law - everything is allowed and permitted to 
her...(Israel) does everything it wants in the world because no 
country dares to stop her... How can anyone ever reach any 
settlement with Israel since it is above the law?"
