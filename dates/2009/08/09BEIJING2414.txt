LISTING OF THREE PAKISTAN-BASED INDIVIDUALS 
 
REF: STATE 83156 (NOTAL) 
 
Classified By: Political Minister Counselor Aubrey Carlson for reasons 
1.4 (B/D) 
 
 ¶1. (C) India has not provided sufficient information about the three Pakistan-based individuals it proposed to the UN 1267 Sanctions Committee to merit their listing as terrorists, MFA International Organizations and Conferences Department UN Affairs Division Deputy Director Shen Yinyin told PolOff August 21 as an informal response to reftel points requesting China lift its holds on Lashkar e-Tayyiba (LET/JUD) operatives Abdul Rahman Makki and Azham Cheema, and the leader of Jaish-e-Mohammed (JEM), Mohammad Masood Azhar Alvi.  Deputy Director Shen noted that China ""is very serious"" about its commitments to UNSC Resolution 1267, but without adequate information on the three individuals, China would not lift the hold. 
 
¶2. (C) Deputy Director Shen stated that soon after April 28, when China had placed a technical hold on the three individuals proposed by India, Chinese officials had approached the Indian government for more information on the cases but had since been reportedly told by the Indian government that the information India presented was sufficient to justify the listing.  Adding to some frustration on China's part, according to Shen, were media reports during that time suggesting that India had provided the United Kingdom with additional information on the three Pakistan-based individuals in response to UK requests.
