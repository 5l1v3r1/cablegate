¶1.  TAIWAN: DALAI LAMA VISIT, U.S. ARMS SALES 
 
 "The result will not be good if Taiwan's Democratic Progressive 
Party seeks support from the Dalai Lama" (pg 14) 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(08/28): "The Democratic Progress Party's 
(DPP) decision to join hands with the Tibetan independence movement 
in order to promote Taiwanese independence, using their ideology to 
create cross-Strait confrontation, is clumsy and easily understood. 
Taiwan obviously intends to have Tibetan separatists come over to 
strengthen the Taiwanese independence movement through an alliance, 
and meanwhile create hostility in cross-Strait relations.  The 
strength of the Taiwanese independence movement suffered a setback 
when the DPP stepped down.  Therefore, they are using Tibetan 
separatists as pawns to advance their strategy.  While all parties 
across the Strait were busy fighting against the typhoon and 
conducting disaster relief, the separatists were hatching political 
plots.  All Chinese compatriots across the Strait will despise their 
behavior." 
 
"U.S. decision-makers' confidence in protecting Taiwan shaken" (pg 
7) 
 
Elite Reference (Qingnian Cankao), a newspaper affiliated to the 
official Communist Youth League China Youth Daily (08/28): "An 
American think tank, the New American Security Center, published an 
article on Asian Times online, indicating that, due to changes in 
the strategic environment, Taiwan will have a harder time getting 
access to U.S.-made advanced weapons.  The article said that the 
U.S. has hesitated in arranging arms sales to Taiwan not just 
because of Ma Ying Jeou's policy, but also because of speed at which 
the Mainland has modernized its military, far exceeding U.S. 
predictions.  This has shaken some U.S. decision-makers' confidence 
in protecting Taiwan.  They believe that if the weapons they provide 
Taiwan are not useful in defending the U.S., then it would be better 
to avoid the burden of defending Taiwan.  According to the article, 
the U.S. has realized the increasing difficulty of selling arms to 
Taiwan while maintaining and developing U.S.-China relations. 
However, the article argued that the U.S. should still keep its 
security promise to Taiwan, and said President Obama should bring up 
the issue during his visit to China in November and indicate that 
the U.S. will not stop arms sales to Taiwan." 
 
¶2.  INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENTS IN CHINA 
 
"Foreign democracy organizations join hands with Tibet and Xinjiang 
separatists" (pg 7) 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(08/28): "Foreign democracy organizations, 
which survive with the support of anti-China forces, are supporting 
Tibet, Xinjiang, and Taiwan separatists.  The 'International 
Tibet-Han Conference' that was recently held in Geneva, came to the 
conclusion that Tibet should be separated from China.  However, 
experts argue that a democratic China cannot be achieved if Tibet is 
separated from China.  Foreign democracy organizations quickly lend 
their support to any group that carries out an influential incident 
in China and thus becomes the recipient of international 'political 
dollars.'  To find a legal basis for this, some of these foreign 
democracy organizations have referred back to the draft 'Chinese 
Federal Republic Constitution' issued a decade ago, which suggested 
separating Tibet from China.  How can the ideas of these foreign 
democracy organizations be convincing if they do not even advocate a 
unified China?  China as a country will be finished if it is 
federalized, as proposed in this draft constitution."
