Title- The theme of Uribe's trip 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (8-5) says: "Foreign 
Minister Celso Amorim sided with Hugo Chavez [Brazil's] and 
complained that the Colombian government did not consult neighboring 
countries before signing a [military forces] deal with the 
U.S.....The fact is that Hugo Chavez needed to divert international 
public opinion away from the events that are happening in his 
country and the story about the U.S. bases in Colombia worked 
well.....The Brazilian government questioned the U.S. and Colombian 
governments about something that regards their own sovereignty.  But 
it [Brazil] does not question the Chavez government when it acts 
against fundamental freedom.....That's how Brazil chooses its 
companions." 
 
Title- Uncertain climate 
 
Main editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (8-5) states: 
"Copenhagen's summit.....on climate change, aimed at producing a 
treaty that succeeds and goes beyond the Kyoto Protocol, is only 
four months ahead.  There are a few reasons to believe that such a 
goal [succeeding Kyoto] may not be accomplished, giving room to the 
adoption of a weak deal or to the postponement of negotiations.  One 
of these reasons is the indefiniteness of Brazil's government, a 
country which by all accounts has a decisive role [to play]....the 
Lula administration's shyness on this issue was placed in evidence 
yesterday, with diplomacy, by the British Minister of Energy and 
Climate Change Ed Miliband, who is visiting Brazil....."
