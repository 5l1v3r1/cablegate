SUBJECT: COSTA RICA:  BALANCING SIEPAC PROGRESS AGAINST THE 
RULE OF LAW 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY.  Costa Rica struggles to complete its portion of 
the Panama to Guatemala power grid interconnection project 
(SIEPAC).  The negotiation and acquisition of land consumes 
most of the project's time )- much more so than actual 
construction -- such that only approximately 60 percent of 
the Costa Rican segment is complete.  Experts estimate 
project completion between late 2010 and first quarter 2011. 
Post has become aware of acquisition challenges as an AmCit 
landowner's low-impact, eco-tourism plans for his property 
were jeopardized by the current route of the line.  We 
continue to balance and support the need to complete the 
power grid tempered by the rule of law as it pertains to 
AmCit real estate investments.  End Summary. 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
WHEN CAN COSTA RICA COMPLETE THE SIEPAC LINE? 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) On July 22, we met with Pedro Pablo Quiros, Chief 
Executive Officer of the state telecommunications and 
electricity entity (ICE).  When asked about the status of the 
Costa Rican portion of the Electricity Interconnection System 
for Central America (SIEPAC) transmission line, Quiros made 
two points regarding project status: 
 
-- The Costa Rican segment spans 425 kilometers (km) and all 
but 60 km are complete.  (Note:  Figures for the Costa Rican 
segment vary from as low as 425 km to as high as 493 km.  End 
Note.) 
 
-- However, construction as a function of distance is not the 
challenge; time as a function of expropriation is. 
Acquisition negotiations, studies, and permitting consume the 
time.  Thus, though 80 percent of the transmission line has 
been constructed, Quiros estimated that only 60 percent of 
the project is complete.  Quiros projected a completion date 
between late 2010 and first quarter 2011. 
 
------------------------- 
IS ICE DIRECTLY INVOLVED? 
------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) The Network Business Owner (EPR) is constructing the 
project in Costa Rica as in other Central American countries. 
 Public and private capital finance this firm whose mission 
is to construct the SIEPAC interregional grid.  However, ICE 
recently joined EPR to facilitate and hasten the land 
acquisition/easement rights part of the work.  Quiros 
claimed, "We have much experience with that type of work."

INVESTOR CHALLENGES 
------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) As an example of acquisition challenges, AmCit 
landowner Kirk McDonald Park contacted Embassy San Jose in 
November 2008 about ICE encroachment on his property.  Park 
plans to develop a low-impact, eco-tourism lodge on his 
property.  ICE wants to run the SIEPAC line through Park's 
property.  This route will avoid the village of La Alfombra 
(which is the most direct route) and is south of Park's 
property.  Park proposed that ICE skirt his property further 
to the north.  Park has lined up the support of virtually all 
environmental groups (such as The Nature Conservancy, 
Conservation International, Peace for Nature, etc.) and two 
key GOCR agencies, one similar to the USG's Environmental 
Protection Agency (SETENA) -) and the Ministry of 
Environment, Energy and Telecommunications (MINAET).  Park 
has even gained verbal support from the GOCR's Ministry of 
the Presidency. 
 
¶5. (SBU) From the Quiros meeting, we learned that ICE now 
believes that the Park property cannot be avoided.  ICE, 
however, seemingly has flip-flopped on the "north alternate 
route," initially not supporting, then supporting, and now 
not supporting it.  (Comment:  ICE's changes in position seem 
to be related to turnover in its expropriation group.  End 
Comment.)  Park claims to have a construction estimate 
demonstrating that the marginal cost of the "north alternate" 
route is not considerable.  Just last week, Park had a 
meeting scheduled with Quiros but Quiros cancelled the 
meeting. 
 
------------------ 
NOT JUST AMERICANS 
------------------ 
 
¶6. (SBU) Canadian citizens are also affected by the SIEPAC 
line in the immediate area of Park's property.  Canadian 
Ambassador Neil Reeder drafted a joint Canadian 
government-USG letter requesting that ICE avoid this 
eco-tourism sensitive area.  The letter, signed by CDA 
Brennan, recognized the cooperation between local villagers 
and ex-pats in the La Alfombra area i seeking an alternative 
route with ICE.

COMMENT

¶7. (SBU) Currently, we ar attempting to balance the 
contrasting positions of inter-regional energy needs with the 
rule of law as applicable to an AmCit investor.  Though we 
are limited in what we can directly do with the GOCR on such 
a case (there is no expropriation without compensation), we 
nonetheless monitor the Park case since a respect for GOCR 
approvals and studies -- which support Park's claim of owning 
ecologically sensitive land -- is essential to creating a 
predictable regulatory and investment climate.
