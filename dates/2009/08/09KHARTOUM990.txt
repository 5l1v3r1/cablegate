SUBJECT: CDA DISCUSSES DARFUR WITH UNAMID COMMANDER 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  General Martin Luther Agwai, outgoing Force 
Commander for the United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur 
(UNAMID), told Charge on August 26 that Darfuris know little about 
democracy, and view the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) as 
a southern party, while the Arab tribes view the National Congress 
party (NCP) as best able to protect their interests.  He questioned 
the current approach to aid in Darfur, which he said created 
dependence on IDP camps and external actors.  The General also noted 
hopeful signs for de-escalation of the conflict between Sudan and 
Chad in the form of cross-border communication between junior 
commanders.  End Summary. 
 
No Obvious Political Solution 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) General Agwai stated that he had not heard Darfuris 
express any affinity or solidarity with the Sudan People's 
Liberation Movement (SPLM).  The General said that most Darfuris 
view the SPLM solely as a southern party.  He added that he also has 
not seen the SPLM making a real effort to gain support in Darfur. 
General Agwai said that, while the Arab tribes of Darfur do have 
their own regional aspirations, they do have an affinity to the 
National Congress Party (NCP) as they view the NCP as best able to 
protect their interests.  Regarding upcoming elections, the General 
stated that the concept of democracy was almost non-existent in 
Darfur, that most people focused exclusively on tribal and local 
affiliation, and that therefore, people in Darfur did not have a 
view toward an ideal outcome in national elections. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) General Agwai stated that continuing rebel fragmentation 
had made the work of UNAMID very challenging, since there was no 
fixed rebel command structure with which to discuss issues, or on 
which to apply pressure.  General Agwai blamed the political 
fragmentation in Darfur on the selfishness of the actors involved. 
He stated that rather than representing a constituency, most rebel 
leaders are seeking money, power and "the chance to see their face 
in the newspaper."  He added that rebel groups had become so 
fragmented that they were little more than bandits.  He said he does 
not expect major fighting for the time being, but that fighting will 
escalate again at the end of the rainy season. 
 
Camps Provide Services Not Available in Villages 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) General Agwai questioned the current approach to aid in 
Darfur.  He stated that Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) had, in 
some respects, come to prefer IDP camps to their villages because 
the camps provide schools, medical care and free food which their 
villages do not have, and never did.  He noted that some IDPs have 
begun moving in and out of the camps, returning to their villages to 
farm for significant periods, and then returning to the camps.  He 
indicated that this willingness to move back and forth connotes an 
improved security situation, as IDPs were not farming two years ago. 
 The General expressed the view that moving the benefits of the 
camps closer to the villages may be a way to encourage voluntary 
return. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) General Agwai stated that international actors had made 
the rebels in Darfur intransigent.  He said that the people of 
Darfur have come to believe that progress consists of more 
involvement from the international community.  He stated that he 
believes the world's attention to Darfur will soon move on to other 
issues and that the window of opportunity for real improvement there 
is limited. 
 
Hopeful Signs in Sudan/Chad Conflict? 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) General Agwai said there were signs of communication and 
cooperation among lower level military commanders on the Sudan/Chad 
border.  He noted one incident in which a Chadian commander and a 
Sudanese commander had talked on the phone in order to end a cross 
border incursion from Chad into Sudan.  The General expressed the 
hope that this kind of dialog would de-escalate this conflict. 
 
¶7. (SBU) COMMENT: General Agwai has a deep knowledge of the 
challenges in Darfur, having commanded UNAMID since its 
establishment in July, 2007.  General Agwai's observations regarding 
non-Arab Darfuris feeling no connection to the SPLM or any other 
viable political force adds to the general pessimism about the 
viability of national elections there.  His view that IDPs will 
choose to continue to move into and out of the IDP camps to take 
advantage of services not available in their villages argues for a 
change of approach to aid in Darfur.  General Agwai's information 
about lower level contact between Sudanese and Chadian commanders 
offers some hope for a de-escalation of that proxy conflict, though

it is unclear whether this is an anomaly or a trend. END COMMENT.
