¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  South Kordofan's ICC-indicted Governor, Ahmed 
Mohamed Haroun (NCP) and his SPLM deputy, Abdel Aziz Al Helou, asked 
international donors on August 8 for humanitarian and development 
assistance in delivering a peace dividend to the people of their 
state.  They described a newly created Council of Elders as a 
consultative body to help the government avoid conflict and a 
Reconciliation and Peaceful Coexistence Mechanism (RPCM) to both 
resolve existing conflicts and diffuse possible conflicts.  Haroun 
also promised to do "what was in his power" to ease donor and NGO 
access to travel permits for his state.  While the latest 
initiatives in South Kordofan offer the best hope of progress in 
years, the short time available makes meaningful progress prior to 
elections uncertain.  END SUMMARY 
 
Rapid Help from Donors Sought 
----------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Governor of South Kordofan and International Criminal 
Court-indictee, Ahmed Mohamed Haroun (NCP), stated that the people 
of South Kordofan have suffered greatly, especially after the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) was signed in 2005.  Haroun 
listed a number of areas on which he seeks help from donors, 
including reconciliation, integration, institutional capacity 
building, strengthening police and Joint Integrated Units, improving 
roads and infrastructure, mine removal, poverty reduction, and 
disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration.  Haroun noted that 
the people of South Kordofan have not experienced the anticipated 
peace dividends from the CPA.  He stated that the working 
environment in South Kordofan is now secure and under a unified 
government, but with only eight months before elections, rapid help 
from donors is needed to maintain hope, and thereby peace, among the 
people. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Abdel Aziz Al Helou, Deputy Governor of South Kordofan, 
(SPLM) supported Haroun's call for urgent action.  Al Helou stated 
that his government wants to "compensate" the people for the four 
years lost to struggle between the National Congress Party (NCP) and 
the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM).  Al Helou further 
stated that the people of South Kordofan must be educated about the 
elections for the elections to work and not turn violent.  He added 
that the people of South Kordofan must see the benefits of the CPA, 
because "otherwise there is no way to know what the people will do 
in the Popular Consultations." 
 
Consultation, Reconciliation Tools Created 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (U) Al Helou noted that, in order to reduce conflict, in July his 
government created a "Council of Elders" for South Kordofan with 
which the state government would consult.  The Council's sixty 
members represent a broad spectrum of people with influence in South 
Kordofan, including intellectuals and opposition party leaders.  Al 
Helou stated that the Council is doing its best, but that it needs 
more support from the donor community. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In July the Government of South Kordofan also established a 
team of nine people called the Reconciliation and Peaceful 
Coexistence Mechanism (RPCM).  At a meeting with the Three Areas 
Donors Steering Committee on August 9, Osman Gadim Ahmad, the RPCM's 
newly-appointed head, stated that the RPCM's purpose is to help 
implement the CPA by increasing peace and stability in South 
Kordofan.  Ahmad views the RPCM's role as an independent arbiter of 
disputes and promoter of reconciliation.  (NOTE: While Ahmad 
recognizes that the government established the RPCM and pays its 
salaries, he stated that the RPCM is independent and that the 
government will not interfere with its activities.  END NOTE.) 
Ahmad also intends the RPCM to be a bridge between donors and NGOs 
interested in aiding reconciliation, and existing political, civic, 
religious, native and educational groups in South Kordofan.  Members 
of the Steering Committee expressed support for the RPCM.  Ahmad 
shared his proposed start-up budget of SDG 809,208 with the Steering 
Committee, and said he welcomed international donor assistance. 
 
Governor to Help On Visas 
------------------------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) Regarding the Popular Consultations called for by the CPA 
and scheduled for 2011, PolOff asked whether the Governor believes 
that national legislation is necessary to conduct the consultations 
in his state.  Haroun stated that his government and the Government 
of Sudan were still discussing the issue.  (NOTE: In July trilateral 
talks, NCP and SPLM officials agreed to make the determination as to 
the necessity of national legislation by July 30. END NOTE.)

Members of the Steering Committee expressed concern about 
difficulties experienced by NGOs and donors in getting travel 
permits in connection with their work in South Kordofan.  Haroun 
said he recognized that these issues exist and stated that he would 
do what was in his power to make the provision of aid in South 
Kordofan easier. 
 
¶7. (SBU) COMMENT:  While Haroun's cooperation with his SPLM deputy, 
the new reconciliation and consultation mechanisms, and Haroun's 
promise to facilitate requested aid in his state are all hopeful 
signs, it remains to the seen whether enough meaningful progress can 
be made in the short timeframe before elections. END COMMENT.
