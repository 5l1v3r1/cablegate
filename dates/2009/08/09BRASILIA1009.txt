consultations with officials at Brazil's Civil Aviation Regulation 
Agency (ANAC) on August 7, 2009 and delivered a diplomatic note to 
Brazil's Ministry of External Relations (MRE) on August 10, 2009 to 
request that the GOB agree to hold a formal final discussion with 
the FAA on October 28-29 in Rio de Janeiro to review the noted 
safety oversight deficiencies and any corrective measures the GoB 
has taken since the IASA assessment in May 2009. In addition, post 
presented a letter from the FAA's Director of Flight Standards 
addressed to ANAC President Dr. Solange Paiva Vieira, who was 
traveling outside Brazil, to ANAC's Acting Chief of Staff Jose 
Ferreira, per reftel A request, on August 7 and to MRE on August 10. 
 A copy of the IASA report was given to Ferreira during the August 7 
meeting and sent electronically on August 10 to Vieira, Ferreira, 
ANAC's Director of Safety Claudio Passos and to ANAC's 
Superintendent of Safety Carlos Pellegrino.  Post has not yet 
received a response from the GOB confirming these proposed dates. 
End summary.

Aviation Specialist met with ANAC's Ferreira to review the letter 
directed to President Vieira, the text of the diplomatic note, and

the diplomatic note tracked with a letter received from the FAA a 
month ago that also identified areas of concern resulting from the 
IASA assessment. Ferreira mentioned that he would be giving the
