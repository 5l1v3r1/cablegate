REF: STATE 83031 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) On August 17, Charge shared reftel points on 
upcoming Afghan elections with MFA Political Director Rea 
Yiordamlis, emphasizing the need for credibility of the 
process, a legitimate outcome, and the impartiality of the 
USG. Yiordamlis welcomed the USG position and expressed 
broad agreement with this message, particularly on the need 
for crediblity. Yiordamlis said that Cyprus, like the US, 
wants to see fair elections that result in a legitimate 
outcome. While acknowledging that the security situation in 
Afghanistan is "difficult" -- and that this could have a 
negative effect on the elections -- Yiordamlis nevertheless 
hoped that violence would subside.
