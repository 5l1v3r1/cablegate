REF: A - 09 BANGUI 152 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The east of the Central African Republic (CAR) 
has long been home to a mix of Central African, Sudanese and 
Chadian pastoralists who have existed more or less out of the 
purview of their respective capitals. Recently, however, it has 
become an area overrun by poachers, brigands and rebels due to 
an almost complete lack of CAR government (CARG) presence and 
tribal competition over diamond mines (Ref A). Incursion into 
southeastern CAR by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and the 
violence between cross-border ethnicities in the northeast are 
increasingly dragging Sudan and Uganda into the CAR's internal 
problems.  The growing involvement of the Sudanese and Ugandans 
has also led to some speculation that they are maneuvering to 
gain influence in the region before the 2011 referendum on 
independence in Southern Sudan. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During a recent meeting with the European Commission's 
military affairs advisor to President Bozize, DCM and POLOFF 
discussed the Central African Army's (FACA) role in the efforts 
against the LRA. Unhappy about the lack of coordination between 
the Ugandan Army (UPDF) and the FACA, the advisor mentioned that 
the UPDF elements operating in the CAR had their forward 
operating base in Southern Sudan rather than the CAR. He was 
firmly convinced that they were using the pursuit into the CAR 
of the LRA as a way make their presence in Southern Sudan a fait 
accompli in the lead up to 2011. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Similarly, the government in Khartoum is taking an 
increased interest in the conflict in the Vakaga. The Vakaga has 
long been home to border crossing pastoralist and there is 
almost no formal delineation between the CAR and Sudan. The 
diamond-rich Vakaga looks to Sudan for most of its economic 
activity, and the violence of recent months has caught the 
attention of the government in Khartoum. A recent peace 
initiative signed between the warring Kara and Goula in Birao 
contained a telling clause: ``in conjunction with the delegation 
from the Ta'asha of Um-Dafok designated by the Sudanese 
Government (GOS) . . . we. . . accept the peace pact [of July 
15, 2009].'' 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post has previously reported that Ta'asha (ethnic 
cousins of the Kara) took part in the June 21, 2009 fighting, 
but there was no evidence until mid-July that the GOS was 
formally recognizing their role and acting on their behalf. It 
should be noted that the GOS may be seeking simply to protect 
its citizen's economic interest in the Vakaga.  However, when we 
asked Special Representative to the Secretary General for Chad 
and CAR (SRSG) Victor Angelo (protect)  about this clause, he 
affirmed that there was increasing evidence of involvement by 
the GOS in the Vakaga. He put forth that the GOS is worried 
about the ungoverned space in the CAR as it could provide a 
haven from which anti-regime elements might base themselves in 
preparation for potential conflict in 2011. By supporting a 
proxy militia like the Kara (UMDR - Union of the Democratic 
Movement for Unity), the GOS may be hoping to limit their 
exposure to a threat from their Southeast. President Bashir 
knows all too well that the chaotic Chad-CAR has caused 
headaches for President Deby. 
 
¶5. (SBU) COMMENT: The governments of Sudan and Uganda have 
discerned correctly that the CARG cannot secure its eastern 
expanses. Facing a multitude of problems closer to Bangui, 
Bozize often finds the Vakaga and other prefectures simply too 
distant to prioritize. Therefore, the sparsely populated eastern 
portion of the country poses a risk to the government in 
Khartoum and Kampala. As of now, no elements of the Southern 
Sudanese Army (SPLA) have joined the Ugandans in the CAR but if 
they do, it would certainly raise a red flag. END COMMENT.
