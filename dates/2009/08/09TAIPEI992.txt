¶1. (SBU)  SUMMARY. The death toll from Typhoon Morakot has 
reached 117 individuals.  The agricultural sector has lost an 
estimated USD300 million, and road repair costs are already 
topping USD420 million.  Local areas see continued 
improvements in infrastructure and sanitation conditions as 
rescue and relief crews move into smaller towns and villages. 
 The Executive Yuan announced that Taiwan welcomes foreign 
nations to provide material support to relief efforts.  USAID 
Acting Regional Advisor Ron Libby arrives in Taiwan on August 
14 for a four-day visit to Taipei and affected areas in the 
south.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The death toll from Typhoon Morakot has climbed to 
117, with 45 individuals reported injured, 59 known to be 
missing and hundreds more unaccounted for (mainly in remote 
mountain villages).  The death toll is nearly double what 
official Taiwan sources reported 24 hours ago.  A total of 
2,2000 individuals have been found and rescued from the most 
severely affected villages in Kaohsiung County.  In Xiaolin 
Village, where over 400 residents may have been buried under 
mudslides, 142 individuals have been rescued and temporary 
road access to the town has been established.  Rescue teams 
are now walking into the village to search for more survivors 
and victims. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Economic losses are also mounting, now estimated at 
over USD300 million for the agricultural sector alone.  The 
Council of Agriculture estimates it will take at least six 
months to rehabilitate agricultural production to pre-typhoon 
levels.  The largest agricultural losses occurred in 
Pingtung, Kaohsiung, and Tianan counties (combined total 
damage of USD190 million).  Estimated road repair costs have 
already exceeded USD420 million, and final infrastructure 
costs are expected to be many times that amount.  A contact 
at the Ministry of Transportation and Communications (MOTC) 
tells us that much of the repair work will be opened to 
tender, and MOTC therefore does not want to speculate on what 
the total cost of infrastructure repair could be. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  AIT/K reports that in Kaohsiung County there are 
nearly 16,000 military personnel involved in rescue and 
relief operations, as well as 37 medical doctors and 120 
nurses.  7,000 hectares of farmland have been destroyed.  In 
Taitung County, most telecommunications have been restored 
and helicopters are dropping food supplies to cut-off 
villages.  In Pingtung County, dead livestock has been mostly 
cleared and operations now are focusing on mud removal from 
residential areas.  The situation in Chiayi County is 
improving with the arrival of more military personnel and 
helicopters.  Tainan County is also seeing an improving 
situation, with water levels in towns and villages receding 
and road and bridge repair work in full swing. 
 
¶5.  (SBU).  The Executive Yuan announced that Taiwan welcomes 
foreign nations to provide material support to relief 
efforts, including large helicopters to carry earth moving 
equipment, chlorine tablets, disinfectant, and portable 
sterilization equipment.  Japan and the EU have approached 
AIT, asking about the possibility of coordinating 
contributions.  The EU has activated its community action 
mechanism, through which member states will try to meet the 
requirements identified in the international appeal Taiwan 
issued yesterday.  However, none of the member states are 
considering meeting the helicopter request. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  AIT is expecting the arrival of Bangkok-based 
USAID Acting Regional Advisor Ron Libby for a four-day visit 
to Taipei and affected areas in the south.  Mr. Libby is 
tentatively scheduled to meet in Taipei with Red Cross 
 
TAIPEI 00000992  002 OF 002 
 
 
officials, MOTC and rescue and relief officials, and a 
representative from the EU.  AIT/K is working on a schedule 
of meetings and opportunities to view affected areas for 
August 16-17.
