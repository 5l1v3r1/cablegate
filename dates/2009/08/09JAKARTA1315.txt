SHOOT-OUT IN CENTRAL JAVA 
 
¶2.  (U) On the evening of Friday, August 7, Indonesian police 
raided a house Temanggung, Central Java, believed to be the 
hideout of wanted terrorist Noordin Top.  (Note:  Top, 
Indonesia's most wanted fugitive, is the suspected mastermind 
of the July 17 bombings at Jakarta's JW Marriott and Ritz 
Carlton hotels.  He is also suspected of involvement in 
earlier attacks.) Elite anti-terror unit Detachment-88 and 
other police elements conducted the operation that resulted 
in a lengthy shoot-out with suspected militants holed up 
inside. 
 
RAID IN JAKARTA SUBURB 
 
¶3.  (U) In another August 7 operation, anti-terror units 
raided a suspected militant safe house in Bekasi, a suburb 
east of Jakarta.  Authorities killed two suspected militants 
and seized around 500kg of explosives in the operation. 
Media reports claimed that militants were using the house to 
prepare for additional attacks. 
 
AWAITING OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION 
 
¶4.  (U) Most media sources have reported that Noordin Top was 
killed in the Central Java raid.  However, officials 
have yet to confirm his death.  Mission will continue to 
monitor the situation and remains in contact with 
law-enforcement officials in an effort to confirm Top's death 
and other details of the operations.
