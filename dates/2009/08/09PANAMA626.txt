Security Leadership Muddle 
-------------------------- 
 
¶1.  (S//NF)  Six weeks into the Martinelli Administration, 
the make up of the GOP security leadership is complicated and 
unclear.  The Minister of Government and Justice Jose Raul 
Mulino is exerting control over formal communications between 
the Embassy and the various security services, but there is 
little sign that the MOGJ is exerting either strategic or 
tactical control over the security services. Individual 
service chiefs, including Panamanian National Police (PNP) 
Director Gustavo Perez, National Aero-Naval Service (SENAN) 
Director Rigoberto Gordon, and National Frontier Service 
(SENAFRONT) Director Frank Abrego seem to be treating the 
MOGJ only as an administrative facilitator to process budget 
requests. On operational issues, both tactical and strategic, 
they are acting on their own, with minimal coordination among 
themselves, and with no strategic leadership from above. What 
coordination there is among security services, is usually the 
result of Embassy intervention. Multiple sources report that 
the service chiefs and other officials responsible for 
security are under intense pressure from President Martinelli 
to deliver immediate results. 
 
¶2.  (S//NF)  This situation has been exacerbated by the 
creation of the Secretariat for Security in the Ministry of 
the Presidency, to which former drug prosecutor Jose Almengor 
was recently appointed. Vice Minister of Government and 
Justice for Security Alejandro Garuz told PolOff August 3 
that Almengor's job description was very similar to his own, 
and that the Minister of Government and Justice, Jose Raul 
Mulino, was not sure what Almengor's job was, or how it would 
effect the Vice Ministry of Security. Jaime Trujillo, 
Executive Secretary of the Council for Public Security and 
National Defense (CSPDN or Consejo), told EmbOff August 8 
that Almengor was "just Jimmy's security advisor" in 
reference to Minister of the Presidency Jimmy Papadimitriu, 
and did not have a significant security role. Mulino was 
later quoted in the newspaper suggesting that Almengor's 
office might become the nucleus of a future Ministry of 
Security. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Varela Concerned, Plans to Play a Greater Role 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶3.  (S//NF)  VP/FM Juan Carlos Varela told the Ambassador 
August 4 that he was concerned about the fragmented and 
chaotic manner in which security policy was being made. He 
said that there was a struggle for power over the security 
apparatus between Mulino and Papadimitriu, and that as a 
result he intended to intervene and take personal control of 
the security issue. He asked the Ambassador to coordinate the 
Embassy's security agenda directly with him in bi-monthly 
meetings. 
 
-------------- 
Mulino's Role? 
-------------- 
 
¶4.  (S//NF)  On July 24 Charge met with Mulino to get a read 
out of his recent trip to Colombia, where press reports 
indicated security agreements had been reached. In a two hour 
meeting, Mulino described at length the Colombian prison 
system, and how he hoped to improve the Panamanian prison 
system. Mulino made general remarks about the high level of 
the Colombian delegation, but did not elaborate on any 
agreements, and stayed focused solely on prisons.  According 
 
to Manuel Zambrano, the new Director of the Integral Security 
Program (PROSI) at MOGJ, the Inter-American Development Bank 
(IDB) is investing in an analytical and strategic planning 
unit in the MOGJ as part of the $20 million loan the IDB gave 
Panama several years ago to improve citizen security. While 
this unit could be very helpful, Mulino's apparent weakness 
on security issues calls into question whether such a unit 
will be able to play a useful role without an empowered 
minister. 
 
----------------------- 
Trujillo Up to the Job? 
----------------------- 
 
¶5.  (S//NF)  During most of the Torrijos Administration, the 
security coordinating role largely fell to the Consejo, where 
Secretary General Erik Espinosa and his deputy Javier 
Fletcher maintained tight operational control over all the 
security services, and coordination with the USG. While they 
were effective in some ways, their somewhat unsavory 
reputation led Colombia and Mexico to restrict their security 
cooperation with Panama, all of which had to run through 
Consejo. Martinelli's removal of both men apparently prompted 
better cooperation with Colombia. However, it is not clear 
that Trujillo, who until July 1 was the head of security at 
Martinelli's Super 99 super market chain, is really up to the 
job. There are indications that the new deputy, Aldo Macre, 
may be very competent, and that he has a very good working 
relationship with Trujillo. Nevertheless, it remains to be 
seen how much power he will have to pull the security 
apparatus together in a coherent way. 
 
----------------------- 
McKinsey to the Rescue? 
----------------------- 
 
¶6.  (S//NF)  The GOP has hired the U.S. consulting company 
McKinsey to help them with strategic planning. They are 
working on a government wide proposal, and one specifically 
aimed at improving the security system. Post is cooperating 
closely with McKinsey, which is basing its recommendations on 
the same set of best practices Post has used (focus on gang 
prevention, community policing, strengthening the police as 
an institution, including effective internal affairs), in the 
hope that the government will accept the advice for which 
they are paying. 
 
------- 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (S//NF)  It is unclear to Post if Varela can bring 
coherence to the GOP security muddle, but he is smart, 
rational, and clearly committed to strengthening Panama's 
democratic institutions, so we will do our best to help him 
succeed.  Given the weak and muddled security leadership at 
the moment, Post will proceed cautiously as we build up high 
level GOP support for our various security initiatives, 
knowing that a "yes" from one actor may have no buy-in beyond 
that actor. We will keep all USG entities informed about 
progress in developing a coherent security strategy in order 
to minimize the risk of USG entities getting drawn into 
uncoordinated and potentially harmful initiatives - and there 
is no shortage of them at this early stage of the Martinelli 
government.
