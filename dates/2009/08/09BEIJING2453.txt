  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1.  CHINA'S CURRENCY 
 
"We should not be rash about RMB internationalization" (pg 14) 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(08/26): "A signal that China is becoming a 
truly powerful country will be when the world starts to purchase and 
deposit China's currency, the RMB.  The financial crisis has made 
China realize the danger of maintaining its wealth in U.S. dollars. 
Internationalization of the RMB is connected to China's strength; 
however, this will be a long process and we cannot be rash about it. 
 The RMB's reputation has yet to be established.  People in 
countries neighboring China are willing to trade in RMB, but are 
unwilling to hold deposits in RMB.  The RMB must first be widely 
used in countries neighboring China; only then can it be 
internationalized.  The financial crisis seems to have given China 
an opportunity to move forward with plans to internationalize the 
RMB.  However, in reality the situation is less optimistic.  China 
must have a long-term strategic plan, prepare for various risks, and 
adjust its plans in a timely manner according to realistic trade and 
tourism circumstances." 
 
¶2.  U.S.-CHINA TRADE RELATIONS 
 
"China's possible 'revenge list' against the U.S. does not comply 
with an optimized and continuous game" (pg 2) 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company's business newspaper 21st 
Century Business Herald (21 Shiji Jingji Baodao) (08/26): "Some 
Chinese officials are concerned that President Obama may give in to 
political pressure and decide to take protective measures against 
Chinese tire products.  Some scholars have suggested creating a 
'revenge list' of U.S.-China trade products as a way to deal with 
the situation.  In fact, China has avoided taking radical measures 
to deal with other countries' protectionist policies aimed at 
correcting the unbalanced role of China in international trade.  As 
a major exporter, China will be harmed more than importing countries 
if large-scale protectionist measures are adopted.  A country's 
negotiating ability determines what kind of foreign trade policy it 
can choose.  If a country has enough domestic demand, it will not be 
pressured during trade negotiations by countries it exports to.  For 
China, the best long-term solution is to cultivate domestic demand, 
rather than to create a 'revenge list,' which will only be effective 
in the short term and will cause more harm than good." 
 
¶3.  BRIBERY CASE 
 
"What does the CCI case mean?"  (pg A13) 
 
The Shanghai-based Shanghai Media Group (SMG) publication, China 
Business News (Diyi Caijing)(08/25): "The Control Component Inc. 
(CCI)(a U.S. company) case does not target China, but rather U.S. 
companies' corrupt behavior overseas.  Chinese companies should not 
feel disgruntled by the Justice Department's handling of the case, 
but rather should take the opportunity to investigate possible 
bribery in China.   A company's behavior and an individual's 
behavior should be taken separately.  Taking bribes is normally the 
behavior of an individual.  When stressing that their companies did 
not accept bribes, the Chinese companies affected by this case 
should be aware that certain individuals may have been involved in 
bribery.  These companies should therefore be cautious in their 
positions and statements on the issue.  International judicial 
cooperation should also be stepped up.  This will enhance China's 
ability to crack down on corruption.  The CCI case has in fact 
provided a good opportunity for cooperation."
