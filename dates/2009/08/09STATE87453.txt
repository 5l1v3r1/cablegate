REF: NICOSIA 537 
 
In response to reftel request for guidance, post is requested 
to pass the following information to the GOC regarding the 
Contact Group for Piracy off the Coast of Somalia (CGPCS). 
 
-- The USG views the planned Cypriot donation to the CGPCS 
Trust Fund as entirely appropriate and congratulates GOC on 
its notable gesture of support for CGPCS efforts to 
facilitate the prosecution of suspected pirates. 
 
-- The USG welcomes GOC participation in all CGPCS fora.  We 
understand that Japan, chair of the Fourth Plenary in New 
York City on September 10, has issued invitations to Cyprus 
and other interested nations to participate in this meeting. 
 
 
-- USG hopes that GOC, as a full CGPCS participant, will 
undertake to prosecute pirates attacking Cypriot-flagged, 
-owned, or )crewed ships; discourage the payment of ransoms 
that fuel piracy; and encourage its registry fleet to 
implement Best Management Practices for ship self-defense.
