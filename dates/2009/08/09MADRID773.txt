GDP Falls Again, but by Less 
 
1.(U)  Spain's GDP fell by 0.9% between the first and second 
quarter, bringing the year-on-year decline to 4%, according 
to the Bank of Spain.  Although the economy continued to 
contract, the decline was less than the 1.9% drop in the 
first quarter.  (Europa Press, 7/30) 
 
Unemployment Rises Slightly in June to 18.1% 
 
2.(U) According to the EU's statistics office, unemployment 
rose to 18.1% in June, more than double the 8.9% EU average. 
Eurostat also revised its previously announced May 
unemployment figure down from 18.7% to 17.9%, meaning that 
unemployment continued to rise in June but is slightly lower 
than had been believed.  Eurostat's new figures are in line 
with the Spanish National Statistics Institute (INE) 
announcement last week that unemployment was 17.9% in the 
second quarter as a whole.  (EFE, 7/31; INE, 7/24) 
 
Inflation Falls to -1.4% 
 
3.(U)  Year-on-year inflation fell to a record low of -1.4% 
in July, according to a preliminary National Statistics 
Institute estimate.  Comment: It appears that prices actually 
rose slightly in July, but by less than they had risen in 
July 2008, when oil prices peaked.  The year-on-year rate is 
expected to become less negative starting in August and to 
reach low positive numbers before the end of the year.  (INE, 
7/30) 
 
U.S. Company Spain's Best to Work for 
 
4.(U) Kimberly-Clark was named Spain's best large company to 
work for out of 147 that participated in Actualidad Economica 
magazine's annual survey.  Spanish multinationals took the 
next three spots: Telefonica and the banks Banesto and 
Santander.  Other U.S. companies in the top ten were Cisco 
Systems and GE.  (Actualidad Economica, 7/24)
