SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
TO SENEGAL ON LICENSE GC 0997-09 
 
REF: 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license inquiry on a request (DDTC case GC 0997-07) for 
the re-export of three (3) C-130H aircraft from Nigeria to 
Senegal.  The aircraft are defense articles controlled under 
the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) 
administered by PM/DDTC.  Post is requested to complete this 
Blue Lantern inquiry within 30 days.  Lack of response to a 
Blue Lantern inquiry will affect pending and future license 
requests involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request: 
 
--Brokering of aircraft by private entity A.D. Consultants 
(ADCON), Israel on behalf of government of Nigeria and 
Senegal without prior approval from DDTC.  In addition, ADCON 
was not registered as a broker with DDTC as required under 
the ITAR.  ADCON subsequently registered under parent company 
Oforid Holdings, Ltd., Israel. 
 
--Re-titling of C-130H aircraft from Government of Nigeria 
(Ministry of Defense) to ADCON without prior approval from 
DDTC. 
 
--Sole documentation establishing relationship between ADCON 
and Government of Senegal is limited to an end-user 
certification stating that the C-130H aircraft were "ordered 
through" ADCON.  No documentation or contract between ADCON 
and GoS detailing the terms and conditions of the sale. 
 
--No documentation on the source, type, and amount of any 
fees, payments, or other consideration paid to ADCON for 
brokering the transaction. 
 
--No documentation from GoS indicating the end-use of the 
aircraft. 
 
--Verification that all parties to the transaction have been 
identified. 
 
¶4. ACTION: The Department requests that Post contact the 
Government of Senegal to determine the bona fides of 
re-export transaction. 
 
The following points are included for guidance: 
 
--Would the GoS provide contractual or other documentation 
identifying the role of all parties to the transaction and 
the full terms of purchase? 
 
--To date, has any money been exchanged for the aircraft? 
 
--Would GoS confirm the specific end-use of the aircraft 
(i.e. military transport, border security, humanitarian aid, 
other missions, etc.)? 
 
--Will the aircraft be serviced or refurbished in a third 
country before arrival in Senegal? 
(**NOTE: GC 0997-07 states that the aircraft will be 
transferred to Denel (Pty) Ltd. in South Africa for 
refurbishing before final delivery to Senegal. DDTC would 
like to inquire if Senegal is aware of the transaction and 
Denel's participation.**) 
 
--Where will the aircraft be located in Senegal upon 
delivery? 
 
--Does the GoS understand the restrictions on USML items, 
especially the prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer 
and re-export? 
 
END ACTION.
