SUBJECT: PSI: ANNOUNCEMENT AND INVITATION TO ATTEND PSI 
EXERCISE LEADING EDGE 2010 
 
 SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST 
-------------------------- 
 
¶1.  In keeping with the PSI goal to improve 
interdiction cooperation and capabilities through 
the conduct of international PSI exercises, we wish 
to inform all addressees about the upcoming US-UAE 
hosted PSI Exercise Leading Edge 2010, and invite 
them to participate or observe selected phases. 
PSI exercise Leading Edge will take place in UAE, 
25-28 January, 2010.  Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, 
Jordan, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, Iraq, 
Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, 
UAE, Yemen, Djibouti, Morocco, Libya, Tunisia, and 
Afghanistan have endorsed the Proliferation Security 
Initiative (PSI) Statement of Interdiction Principles 
and are therefore welcome to fully participate. 
Egypt, Lebanon, Pakistan and India are encouraged to 
endorse the PSI and are welcome to observe all parts of 
the exercise.  A key aspect of the Initiative is its 
exercise & training program to practice WMD-related 
interdiction actions and provide opportunities to 
network with international counterparts and share 
best practices. 
 
¶2. Leading Edge is a USCENTCOM and USG Interagency (IA) 
supported multilateral PSI exercise designed to develop 
WMD interdiction capabilities with partner nations to 
deter and disrupt illicit transfers of WMD-related 
material, technology, expertise, and equipment, to 
include addressing the challenges of suspect material 
inspection, seizure, and disposition. The goals of 
Exercise Leading Edge are to hone USG/USCENTCOM 
interdiction processes, demonstrate the benefits of PSI 
participation for regional partners and explore partner 
nations' interdiction processes. Leading Edge 2010 will 
be executed in two phases. Phase I executed 18-20 
January 2010 will be a US-only distributed table top 
exercise for the USG IA at multiple locations to explore 
and exercise US-only command and control issues 
associated with PSI related interdictions. Phase II, 
co-hosted with the UAE, will be conducted in UAE 25-28 
January, 2010. Phase II consists of three parts. 
Part 1 is a multilateral ship boarding field training 
exercise to demonstrate/share boarding, search and 
seizure capabilities/best practices with participants 
from Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, 
 
STATE 00084305  002 OF 007 
 
 
and UAE.  Part 2 is a port exercise to demonstrate 
customs/law enforcement capabilities and technologies 
used to identify and seize proliferation cargo; build 
a professional partnership among customs and law 
enforcement personnel; and learn about port and vessel 
operational issues from industry representatives. 
Part 3 is a Table Top Exercise (TTX) that will examine 
legal authorities currently available to PSI partners 
for interdiction, detention, seizure, and disposition 
under port-state and customs/law enforcement control 
and identify seams and gaps in legal authorities that 
may require further national action.  Parts 2 and 3 of 
Phase II are open to full participation from all 
addressed nations. 
 
¶3. Posts are requested to draw from the points in 
paragraph 7 in discussions with appropriate host 
government officials and to encourage host 
government increased involvement in PSI activities, 
including exercise Leading Edge 2010; para 7 below 
may be left as a non-paper. In addition, if host 
government requests or asks about travel funding, 
please contact the USCENTCOM POC below along with your 
recommendations. USCENTCOM has a limited amount of 
funding available to provide airfare and hotel room 
for military related personnel if a country cannot 
otherwise be appropriately represented at the exercise. 
 
¶4.  U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) countries have 
already received an official invitation to participate 
(BAH, KUW, OMN, QAT, UAE) or observe (IRQ, SAU, YEM, 
EGP, JOR, LEB, AFG, KAZ, KYR, PAK, TAJ, TUR, UZB) in 
Exercise Leading Edge, from Commander U.S. Central 
Command, General David H. Petraeus in late February 
and a letter of Modification from Director, Strategy, 
Plans, and Policy, U.S. Central Command, Major General 
Allardice, announcing a date change for the exercise 
from October, 2009 to January, 2010. The distinction 
between participant and observer in the Central Command 
invitation letters is specific to Part 1 of Phase II 
(the field training exercise).  All PSI endorsing 
nations are invited to fully participate in Parts 2 and 
3 of Phase II and observe Part 1 with their full team. 
PSI endorsing nations are encouraged to send country 
specific playing teams consisting of 3 to 5 experts from 
the customs/law enforcement, legal (customs and/or law 
of the sea/ship boarding), and operational (maritime 
law enforcement or Ministry of Defense) communities. 
Observer nations and any country unable to send this 
team make up will still be involved with every aspect 
of TTX play in a larger multinational team. The 
Government of UAE is also intending to issue official 
 
STATE 00084305  003 OF 007 
 
 
invitations to regional partners and select other nations 
to attend and participate in the exercise. 
 
 
¶5. FOR EMBASSIES BEIRUT, CAIRO, NEW DEHLI, AND ISLAMABAD. 
Washington is seeking to ensure Lebanon, Egypt, India, 
and Pakistan take advantage of this opportunity to learn 
more about the PSI by attending the exercise Leading Edge 
as observers.  Pakistan's CJCS has already accepted 
USCENTCOM's invitation.  Posts are requested to invite 
these host governments to send a delegation to attend 
exercise. Additionally, and in advance of the exercise, 
Washington would like these countries to endorse the PSI 
Statement of Interdiction Principles (SOP) (the text of 
which is available at 
http://www.state.gov/t/isn/c27726.htm. 
At posts discretion, posts are requested to 
approach appropriate levels of host government and 
urge endorsement of the PSI. In particular, please 
inform host governments that PSI endorsement is a 
condition for full participation in PSI exercises. 
Posts may draw from points in paragraph 7 and 
8, which also may be left as non-papers.  Posts may also 
leave the sample diplomatic note in paragraph 9 with 
host government.

NONPAPER

¶7. Begin points/non-paper: 
 
 
STATE 00084305  004 OF 007 
 
 
-- We value our close collaboration on many 
nonproliferation issues and look forward to working 
together to deepen our Proliferation Security Initiative 
(PSI) cooperation. 
 
-- On April 5, 2009, in Prague, President Obama expressed 
his support for the PSI. The USG is committed to making 
PSI a durable and effective initiative over the long term 
by improving states' capabilities to stop illicit 
shipments of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD), their 
delivery systems, and related materials worldwide. 
The USG views this effort as a joint endeavor among 
PSI partners. 
 
-- In keeping with our shared desired to prevent 
WMD-related proliferation, we wish to inform you of 
the upcoming US-UAE hosted PSI Exercise, Leading 
Edge 10, and invite you to participate. 
 
-- Exercises are a key component of the PSI. They help 
states improve their WMD related interdiction 
capabilities. 
 
-- PSI participants, including Middle East, Maghreb, 
and Central Asia regional partners, are being invited 
to participate in the PSI Exercise Leading Edge 2010 
to work with other PSI participants to further develop 
and improve capabilities to stop shipments of WMD, 
their delivery systems, and related materials from 
being transferred to and from states and non-state 
actors of proliferation concern. 
 
-- Exercise Leading Edge 2010 will be conducted in the 
UAE from 25 to 28 January 2010 in three parts. 
 
-- Part 1 is a Gulf Cooperation Council focused 
multilateral field training exercise to 
demonstrate/share boarding, search and seizure 
capabilities/best practices. 
 
-- Part 2 is a port exercise to demonstrate customs/law 
enforcement capabilities and technology used to identify 
and seize proliferation cargo; build a professional 
partnership among customs and law enforcement personnel; 
and learn about port and vessel operational issues from 
industry representatives. 
 
-- Part 3 will culminate Phase II and Exercise Leading 
Edge with a Table Top Exercise (TTX) that will examine 
legal authorities currently available to PSI partners 
for interdiction, detention, seizure, and disposition 
under port-state and customs/law enforcement control 
 
STATE 00084305  005 OF 007 
 
 
and identify seams and gaps in legal authorities that 
may require further national action. 
 
-- For Part 3, PSI endorsing nations are encouraged to 
send country specific playing teams consisting of 3 to 5 
experts from ministries involved in international 
security-related decision-making, nonproliferation, 
and export controls (to include international and 
customs law, operational intelligence, law enforcement 
and customs operations, military interdiction 
policy/processes, border security, international 
trade and finance, exercise planning, and 
policy/diplomacy communities). Observer nations and any 
country unable to send this team make up will still be 
involved with every aspect of TTX play in a larger 
multinational team. 
 
-- We invite you to attend the exercise and seek your 
decision to participate, preferably with representation 
by appropriate officials described above. 
 
-- If you agree, U.S. officials will provide you more 
details on PSI Exercise Leading Edge 2010. For planning 
purposes, nations specifically invited to participate 
in Part 1 by CDR USCENTCOM and all other nations planning 
to materially support Part 1 with Naval assets, boarding 
teams, or related equipment, etc. should send 1 or 2 
representatives to the Leading Edge Final Planning 
Conference in UAE 3-5 November and should arrive no 
later than 24 January 2010 for exercise execution. 
 
-- We believe that your government's decision to actively 
participate in PSI exercise Leading Edge 2010 would 
deepen (INSERT HOST COUNTRY NAME) regional 
counter-proliferation cooperation, intensify your 
participation in PSI, and strengthen your position 
as a regional leader. 
 
 
¶8.  Begin points FOR Lebanon, Egypt, India, and Pakistan ONLY: 
 
-- Many other countries in the region have endorsed PSI, 
including Afghanistan, Oman, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, 
Jordan, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Tajikistan, Tunisia, 
Turkey, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, 
Yemen, Morocco, and Libya. 
 
-- In the six years since the inception of the 
Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), 95 countries 
from every region of the world have endorsed the PSI 
Statement of Interdiction Principles. 
 
 
STATE 00084305  006 OF 007 
 
 
-- As a result, the PSI has become the hallmark of 
strong nonproliferation credentials. 
 
-- On April 5 in Prague, President Obama expressed his 
support for the PSI. The Obama Administration is 
committed to strengthen and expand the PSI, to ensure 
it remains effective over the long term in improving 
states' capabilities to stop illicit shipments of WMD, 
their delivery systems, and related materials worldwide. 
 
-- The PSI Statement of Interdiction Principles does 
not entail any legal or operational obligations. 
Nonetheless, endorsement of the Statement of Principles 
provides a clear indication of a country's strong 
nonproliferation credentials, and also acts as a 
strong deterrent to proliferators seeking to abuse 
states' sovereign territory by trafficking WMD and 
missile-related materials and items. 
 
-- Endorsement of the PSI is a signal that a state 
takes its UN obligations seriously, including those 
in UNSCR 1540.  This resolution identified the 
proliferation of WMD as a threat to international peace 
and security.  It also identified cooperative efforts 
as one way in which states could implement their 
obligations to counter WMD and missile proliferation. 
 
-- Active participation in the PSI can assist countries 
with fortifying their economic systems and assets 
(such as ports, industries, etc.) against exploitation 
by illicit traffickers of WMD and related items, as 
well as other illicit materials. 
 
-- To date, the PSI partner countries have conducted 
over 37 operational interdiction training exercises 
(air, maritime, and ground) involving more than 70 
nations.  These exercises are a key element of the PSI 
in increasing the interoperability of PSI participants, 
improving interdiction decision-making processes and 
procedures, and enhancing the interdiction capacities 
of all participating states.  The PSI partner states 
continue to work together by sharing information, 
conducting exercises, and carrying out interdictions 
that improve our ability and readiness to disrupt and 
counter proliferation activities. 
 
-- We welcome your Government's participation in 
the PSI. 
 
-- We urge your government to endorse the PSI Statement 
of Interdiction Principles through a diplomatic note to 
the United States or another PSI partner state prior to 
 
STATE 00084305  007 OF 007 
 
 
Exercise Leading Edge, which will give you the 
opportunity to participate actively in this and future 
PSI exercises.
