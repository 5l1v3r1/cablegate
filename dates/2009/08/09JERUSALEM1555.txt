SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (08/28): Conflicting reports about 
a US-Israeli agreement on settlements 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
The three dailies front-page news refuting earlier reports that the 
US reached an agreement with Israel about a partial freeze of 
settlement activities. Al-Ayyam quotes Palestinian Authority 
Presidential Spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina praising US efforts, but 
denying that any concrete agreements between the US and Israel were 
made. Al-Quds cites US government sources saying that the US 
believes that a freeze of settlement activities must include East 
Jerusalem. Al-Ayyam also runs a separate front page story citing an 
unnamed US official hinting that there might be some flexibility 
concerning a freeze in settlement activity. 
 
The local press highlights the "Elders" visit to the West Bank 
village of Bil'in, the site of weekly demonstrations against the 
barrier being built between Israel and the West Bank. The headlines 
quote former President Jimmy Carter calling on the Israelis to 
remove all settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem to help 
create an independent Palestinian state. 
 
All three dailies run front page coverage of the restrictions 
imposed by the Israeli police on West Bank Palestinians wishing to 
enter Jerusalem to pray on Fridays during Ramadan. Only men over the 
age of 50 and women over the age of 45 may enter the 
city.------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Saleh Al-Qallab opines in Al-Quds independent daily under the 
title "Palestine...from the Chaos of the Revolution to the 
Discipline of the State" (08/28): "The Palestinians will join the 
negotiations that are supposed to resume after Barack Obama launches 
his promised peace plan during the UN General Assembly in September. 
They will go to the negotiations carrying with them the West Bank 
model as a weapon to face Israeli allegations and stalling tactics. 
Security is sustained, and chaos no longer exists. The PA now 
controls everything in the West Bank. The forthcoming independent 
state would be able to fulfill all of its commitments in any 
security or non-security agreements that signs with Israel." 
2) Rasmi Abu-Ali opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida independent daily 
y 
under the headline "Even If It's for One Olive Tree" (08/28):"Now 
[PA Prime Minister Salam] Fayyad doesn't want to wait for 
negotiations to start building an independent Palestinian state ... 
He suggests that we try and light a candle instead of cursing the 
dark. He suggests that we start building what we can build from the 
current infrastructure. And here he calls for a kind of radical 
cultural transformation - the transition from the violent conflict 
mentality to the construction and building mentality - despite all 
the impossible circumstances surrounding the Palestinian people."
