Berlin (16), Hamburg (11), Saxony (9)and Bremen (2). 
 
¶3. (U)  According to RKI, 182 of the total 256 new cases are 
attributed to people returning from travel abroad.  New cases

after being in contact with a laboratory confirmed infected 
person. 
 
¶4. (U)  North Rhine-Westphalia remains the German state with 
the highest number of confirmed virus cases with a total of
