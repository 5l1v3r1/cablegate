SUBJECT: H1N1 UPDATE: 10,155 CONFIRMED CASES 
 
REF:  A) Berlin 977, B) Berlin 962 and previous. 
 
¶1. (U)  SUMMARY: The number of H1N1 infections in Germany 
crossed the 10,000 mark as 385 new cases were confirmed on 
August 11 -- increasing the total to 10,155 cases.  The 
majority of new infections occurred abroad.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (U)  On August 11, the National Reference Center for 
Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) confirmed an 
increase of 385 new laboratory and non-laboratory H1N1 cases 
in Germany over yesterday.  New cases were distributed as 
follows among the federal states: North Rhine-Westphalia 
(133), Lower Saxony (117), Baden-Wuerttemberg (45), Bavaria 
(40), Berlin (21), Hamburg (21), Saxony-Anhalt (7) and Bremen 
(1). 
¶3. (U)  According to RKI, 294 of the 385 new cases are 
attributed to people returning from travel abroad.  New cases 
include also non-laboratory H1N1 cases from people who 
exhibited symptoms after being in contact with a laboratory 
confirmed infected person.  So far, all new cases are 
reportedly mild. 
¶4. (U)  North Rhine-Westphalia remains the German state with 
the highest number of confirmed H1N1 cases with a total of 
3,716 cases followed by Lower-Saxony (1866) and Baden- 
Wuerttemberg (1014).  About 22 percent (2232) of all confirmed 
infections in Germany have resulted from domestic 
transmission. 
 
 
NRW against extension of school break 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U)  A medical expert commission in NRW decided today 
not/not to change first day of school scheduled to begin on 
August 17.  Experts had previously contemplated an extension 
of summer break in an attempt to prevent further spread of the 
virus (ref B).   The new school year has already begun in 
Bremen, Lower-Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia.  The 
federal states of Hesse and Baden-Wuerttemberg are still 
considering extending the summer break.
