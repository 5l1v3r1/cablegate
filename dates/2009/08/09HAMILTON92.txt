SUBJECT: STATUS OF H1N1 IN BERMUDA: TEN CASES 
 
¶1.      The government of Bermuda (GOB) continues to follow WHO 
guidelines for Pandemic Alert Level Phase Six and prominently 
posts H1N1 updates, facts, health tips and contact information 
on its Department of Health website:  www.health.gov.bm 
 .  Bermuda's Minister of Health 
stated in June that Bermuda did not expect to see many cases of 
the flu until autumn.  After an initial flurry of media 
coverage, flu awareness is not much in the public eye.  GOB 
on-line information resources are extensive for a small island; 
publicizing these resources will be key to prevention efforts as 
the weather cools down and children return to school. 
 
¶2.      GOB strategy for Pandemic Flu focuses on prevention, good 
hygiene, and social distancing. The GOB has stockpiled 1,500 
treatment courses of Tamiflu for its population of 65,000.  The 
GOB has not imposed any travel or trade restrictions or 
entry/exit screening, nor has it issued any travel warnings. 
The GOB has not requested assistance from the USG. 
 
¶3.      The GOB reported the three most recently confirmed cases 
on: 30 July 2009, 6 August 2009 and 21 August 2009.  There are 
now a total of ten (10) confirmed cases, eight (8) residents, 
and two (2) visitors.  There have been no secondary cases 
reported.   There have been no deaths.  The press reported the 
first confirmed case of H1N1 flu in Bermuda June 1, 2009.  The 
patient was a 13 year-old American visitor.  The case was later 
reclassified as an "American" case because the patient had come 
from the U.S. This case is not included within the 10 confirmed 
cases for the island.
