Attempts to Address Ministerial Spending 
¶2. (U) Minister of Finance Pravin Gordhan has tabled a draft report 
that addresses public concerns over large expenditure by government 
ministers.  The report was completed by a ministerial task team 
mandated to develop concrete proposals and guidelines that would 
ensure all spheres of government reduce wasteful expenditure and 
divert spending to new areas.  The report calls for a reduction in 
the amount of press advertising bought by government bodies, and on 
spending on ministerial vehicles.  The report also suggests that the 
travel budgets - especially international travels - by departments 
and ministers be cut down, from four officials to one official per 
trip.  The task team consists of Gordhan, Minister of Monitoring and 
Evaluation in the Presidency Collins Chabane, and Minister for 
Public Service and Administration Richard Baloyi.  (New24.com,
