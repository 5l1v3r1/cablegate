Title- Drugs and Unrealism 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (8-8) by Clovis Rossi says: "It 
is charming, but unrealistic, President Lula's thesis that South 
American countries should take over the fight against drug 
trafficking without 'foreign interference'.....It is unrealistic to 
exclude from the fight the country [U.S.] that is the main drug 
consumer.  And it is not possible, as it is obvious, to end the 
offer if the demand remains powerful." 
 
Title- Lula's stubbornness 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (8-9) states: 
"....Even having heard the same arguments that led the Presidents of 
Uruguay, Paraguay and Chile to distance themselves from the 
Venezuelan stance, President Lula was not convinced that Alvaro 
Uribe and Barack Obama are not colluding in a conspiracy to 
militarily conquer South America, starting with Venezuela.  After 
two hours of conversations with Uribe, Foreign Minister Celso Amorim 
reported that President Lula was still fearful that U.S. troops may 
take actions outside the Colombian territory.....The Brazilian 
government pretended to be ignorant to once more help Chavez." 
 
Title- National Defense 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (8-9) notes: "The Brazilian 
Federal Government moves to buy military equipment raises a 
underlying question that needs a clear answer: Should Brazil 
reinforce its defense capacity?  The unequivocal answer is 
yes......Brazil has military expenses that match its participation 
in the world economy......The problem is that the country spends 
badly.....Recognizing the need to reinforce the country's defensive 
power does not mean an invitation to adventures.  Brazil does not 
need and should not stimulate regional arms races or raise concerns 
with regards to the use of nuclear energy....."
