Title- There still is a long way to go before a deal is reached in 
Copenhagen 
Editorial in business oriented Valor Econtmico (8-18) says:"The 
preparatory meetings for the Copenhagen climate summit in December 
are taking place without obvious progress, [this meeting] could 
secure a serious level of commitment with the reduction of gas 
emissions that cause global warming.  Everything indicates that the 
Copenhagen meeting may not be the deadline for a satisfactory 
international deal.....Until then, it is possible to foresee a low 
level of U.S. activism, progress on Brazilian positions that may 
attract Chinese government moderation and attempts to attenuate 
India's radicalism.  The European Union and the U.S. may convince 
large recalcitrant polluters....like Japan, to take a path towards a 
robust deal."
