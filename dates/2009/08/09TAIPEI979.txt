SUBJECT: TAIWAN REQUESTS USG TYPHOON RELIEF ASSISTANCE 
 
REF: TAIPEI 974 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1. (U) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST - PLEASE SEE PARAs 3 and 4. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Taiwan Vice Foreign Minister Andrew Hsia contacted 
A/DIR August 13 to offer thanks for the U.S. contribution to 
the Taiwan Red Cross relief efforts in the wake of Typhoon 
Morakot (ref) and to request additional U.S. assistance.  A 
large number of people remain isolated in afflicted areas, 
without adequate housing or a reliable supply of potable 
water.  Health officials are concerned about the possibility 
of disease as residents return to homes contaminated by flood 
waters. 
 
¶3. (SBU) While Taiwan authorities have most of the equipment 
needed to handle the situation, Hsia said, responders have 
identified a number of specific needs.  Specifically, Taiwan 
iss seeking U.S. and other foreign assistance in providing 
any or all of the following: 
 
- several heavy-lift helicopters capable of transporting 
excavators and dump trucks of at least 32 tons. 
 
- 1000 temporary shelters. 
 
- 100,000 bottles (300-500ml) phenol disinfectant. 
 
- 200,000 bottles chlorine tablets. 
 
- 100,000 liters N-alkyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium chloride. 
 
- 1000 portable sterilizer units.  MOFA did not have specific 
model information, but said disaster relief experts should be 
familiar with the PCO ("pest control operator") sprayer 
equipment used in this type of work. 
 
- 500 automatic sterilizer units.  MOFA also did not have 
specific model information, but said disaster relief experts 
should be familiar with the PCO ("pest control operator") 
sprayer equipment used in this type of work. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Hsia emphasized that the most pressing need, which 
only the United States or Japan can meet, is for heavy-lift 
helicopters to convey earthmoving equipment to the site of 
the hardest-hit areas.  He said this will most likely require 
the service of U.S. pilots familiar with the aircraft, and 
acknowledged this could be an issue.  Nevertheless, this is 
one of Taiwan's most critical needs which it cannot meet on 
its own.
