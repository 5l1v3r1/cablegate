SUBJECT: JAKARTA USAID-USPACOM CONFERENCE ADVANCES 
DEFENSE-DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION 
 
¶1. USAID Mission Indonesia and the Office of Defense 
Cooperation (ODC) Jakarta jointly hosted the USAID-U.S. 
Pacific Command Civil Military Synchronization Planning 
Workshop in Jakarta July 27-30.  The conference's objective 
was to expand civil-military cooperation between USAID and 
USPACOM throughout USPACOM's area of responsibility (AOR), 
with particular focus on Indonesia.  The conference was the 
third Synchronization Meeting held, following those in 
Cambodia (November 2008) and Sri Lanka (April 2009). 
 
¶2.  In his keynote remarks, Ambassador Hume emphasized the 
overarching global development areas of higher education, 
climate change and energy, and democracy and governance, all 
of which are key areas of the proposed U.S.-Indonesia 
Comprehensive Partnership.  He noted the productive 
partnership between USAID and USPACOM and stressed that 
advancements in health fields are particularly important in 
Indonesia.  USAID and USPACOM presenters followed, providing 
briefings on the priority sectors and structures of their 
respective organizations. 
 
¶3.  The four-day conference worked to identify common focus 
areas for coordination of development and defense efforts and 
to improve the ways in which USAID and USPACOM work to common 
objectives.  To those ends, conference attendees conducted 
extensive information-sharing on both development and 
military activities conducted in Indonesia.  Participants 
developed a concept plan to operationalize USAID 
civil-military cooperation policy and created a planning 
framework to coordinate development and defense activities in 
Indonesia.  Attendees also conferred on strategic planning, 
USAID budgeting and contracting, and development of standard 
operating procedures for coordination of USAID and DOD 
activities. 
 
NEXT STEPS 
 
¶4. Internal Mission Jakarta meetings for detailed plan 
development will begin the week of August 3.  Additional 
steps recommended by the conference include: 
 
-- coordination of USPACOM headquarters' civil-military plans 
and activities through a standing Civil-Military Working 
Group; 
-- continued expansion of USAID-USPACOM cooperation to 
additional countries in the AOR; and 
-- a regional workshop co-hosted by the USAID Regional 
Development Mission for Asia and USPACOM.
