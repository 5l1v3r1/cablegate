REF: STATE 71177 
Â¶1. (U)  In response to Reftel, Cape Town Poloff spoke to Mr. Tertius 
LeRoux, prior owner of Digital Image Warehouse and current owner of 
Safari and Outdoor, which he started in July 2008.  Mr. LeRoux sold 
Digital Image Warehouse in September 2008. While still the owner of 
Digital Image Warehouse Mr. LeRoux received the bullets and brass 
casings mentioned in reftel under Licenses 050094533 and 050091122. 
LeRoux told Poloff Digital Image Warehouse was properly licensed by 
the SAG to import and sell defense articles in South Africa.  When 
LeRoux sold Digital Image Warehouse, he took the bullets and casings 
to his new business, Safari and Outdoor, to be used in sport 
shooting and target shooting.  His customers are mainly located in 
Cape Town and the surrounding areas and he also ships throughout the 
country.  He imported from 22 caliber to 458 caliber bullets on the 
above referenced licenses.  His annual sales of U.S. origin defense 
articles are approximately 10 million rand (current rate of exchange 
is 8 rand to 1 USD).  Mr. LeRoux told Poloff he is familiar with the 
restrictions on re-transfer or re-export of U.S. origin defense 
items.  Note. On July 25, Mr. Michael Rufe from the Bureau of 
Industrial Security of the Department of Commerce visited Safari and 
Outdoor to establish its bona fides.  End note.
