------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
Al-Quds leads with reports on Israeli government sources assuring 
that "progress has been achieved concerning the prisoner exchange 
negotiations." The reports also note that negotiations between Hamas 
and Israel have reached a critical stage with expectations that a 
deal will involve the release of kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad 
Shalit in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. According to 
coverage, Germany and former US President Jimmy Carter have been 
engaged with Egypt and other relevant parties to help finalize the 
deal. 
 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida lead with news on Palestinian 
Authority (PA) President Mahmoud Abbas chairing the first meeting of 
the newly elected Fatah Central Committee (FCC) on August 13. The 
dailies quote Abbas reiterating that "Fatah will rebuild itself and 
its political program." The president noted to the press after the 
meeting that Fatah is committed to pursuing dialogue with Hamas and 
to ending the internal division. He also stated that the PA will not 
pursue any negotiations with Israel unless the latter completely 
halts all settlement activity, according to coverage. 
 
In related news, all dailies highlight reports that former PA Prime 
Minister and senior Fatah figure Ahmed Qurai, who was not reelected 
to the FCC, has voiced suspicions about the integrity of the FCC 
electoral process. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front pages news citing Maan News Network and 
Israeli TV Channel One on August 13 that Qatar and Oman will 
consider renewing diplomatic relations with Israel once Israel 
agrees to freeze settlement construction.  Per the coverage, this is 
the result of increased US pressure on Arab states to take tangible 
steps towards normalizing relations with Israel.------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title, "Is 
it time to end the division?"(08/14): "After the success of the 
Fatah conference, isn't it time to end the division and achieve 
reconciliation ... Isn't it time to give consideration to national 
unity and national interests? Isn't it time to prioritize our 
r 
national unity above all else? Weren't the last two years of 
division more than enough? Didn't they give Israel all the time and 
excuses needed to pursue home demolitions and settlement 
expansion?" 
 
2) Rajab Abu Sirriyeh opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
headline "Fatah, the central committee wins" (08/14): "The 
conference has empowered Fatah, which rekindled its status as a 
major movement, led by Abu Mazen, who is now capable of ending the 
internal Palestinian division and more capable of pursuing 
negotiations with Israel. This explains why Netanyahu was nervous 
about the conference. Fatah will now push its political program and 
will pave the way for the Palestinian state."
