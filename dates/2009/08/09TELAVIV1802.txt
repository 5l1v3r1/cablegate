Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
The media reported that Israeli and Hamas spokespeople have 
presented conflicting reports on progress in the talks about the 
possible release of Gilad Shalit.  YediotQs Arab affairs 
correspondent Smadar Perry quoted a senior Egyptian source as saying 
that the U.S. is involved Qbehind the scenesQ in the negotiations, 
mainly on the Syrian track.  (One of the Hamas sources who talked to 
Israel Radio said that an (unspecified) Qthird partyQ is involved in 
the parley.)   According to Yediot, should Bashar Assad show 
Qpositive involvementQ he would get a Qbonus in the form of a new 
American ambassador to Syria,Q the first after 2004.  Yediot said 
that the American premise is that a prisoner exchange deal will 
remove a political obstacle and will facilitate the introduction of 
President Obama's plan for implementing the Arab peace initiative. 
 
All media reported that a special prayer gathering was held last 
night at the Western Wall to celebrate Gilad ShalitQs 23th birthday 
-- his fourth one in captivity. 
 
Leading media reported that two Israelis were lightly wounded 
yesterday evening when Palestinians opened fire on their car north 
of Ramallah.  Israel Radio reported that an organization called the 
QAl-Aqsa Martyrs Brigades-the Imad Mughniyah GroupsQ claimed 
responsibility for the attack.  The radio reported that settlers 
blamed the lifting of roadblocks in the area for the incident. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that Bill Van Esveld, the 
Jerusalem-based researcher for Human Rights Watch (HRW), told the 
newspaper that there is evidence to indicate that war crimes were 
committed by Palestinians in the Gaza Strip who allegedly used 
civilians as "human shields" during Operation Cast Lead.   The Post 
says that this is the first time an international human rights 
organization has publicly made such a statement.  However, the 
newspaper cited HRW as saying that the PalestiniansQ action does not 
justify the armyQs response.  The newspaper reported that HRW is due 
to hold a press conference to present its new report on Cast Lead 
and specifically the alleged killing by IDF soldiers of 11 
Palestinians who were holding white flags. 
 
Maariv and The Jerusalem Post reported that on Sunday U.S. 
Republicans, headed by former Arkansas Governor and presidential 
hopeful Mike Huckabee, a candidate in the 2008 presidential 
elections, will attend a festive dinner at the controversial 
Shepherd Hotel in East Jerusalem to signal President Obama that 
construction in East Jerusalem will continue.  Cabinet members and 
Knesset members will be among the 100 attendees. 
 
HaQaretz reported that Israel has recently been putting up more 
obstacles for foreign nationals who enter the country if they have 
family, work, business, or academic ties in the West Bank.  It now 
restricts their movements to "the Palestinian Authority only."  The 
people concerned are citizens of countries that have diplomatic ties 
with Israel, mainly Western countries.  HaQaretz noted that, in 
imposing such restrictions, Israel is in breach of the Oslo 
Accords. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that yesterday senior Fatah leaders in 
Gaza demanded an investigation into alleged fraud in this weekQs 
election for the factionQs Central Committee. 
 
The Jerusalem Post and Maariv reported that yesterday the Israel 
Antiquities Authority (IAA) condemned the World Archeological 
Congress for holding an international conference in Ramallah 
dedicated to Qovercoming structural violenceQ and the negative 
impact of politics on archeology.  The IAA also complained about 
Israel being excluded from the conference. 
 
Maariv and other media reported that DM Ehud Barak has boosted the 
number of IDF Civil Administration inspectors from 40 to 60, in 
order to tighten supervision of construction in the unauthorized 
settler outposts. 
 
The Jerusalem Post and other media reported that the IDFQs Civil 
Administration has issued stop-work orders on 12 modular homes that 
it claims have been illegally placed at the edge of a street on a 
hilltop within the Kochav YaQakov.  (Yesterday, Israel Radio had 
cited Peace NowQs criticism about construction there.)  The 
Jerusalem Post reported that yesterday MaQaleh Adumim Mayor Benny 
Kashriel protested a sudden governmental freeze on a planned 
19-dunam (4.7-acre) industrial project in his settlement city.  The 
newspaper quoted Kashriel as saying that Netanyahu Qis playing into 
the hands of the Americans.  He is doing above and beyond what they 
want. 
 
Leading media quoted Deputy FM Danny Ayalon as saying yesterday that 
Syria should deal directly with Israel and not insist on indirect 
negotiations through Turkey as if Israel had a plague or was a 
pariah. 
 
Maariv reported that the Iranian government has requested that the 
U.N.Qs International Atomic Energy Agency pass a resolution next 
month forbidding an attack on nuclear installations. 
 
Yediot (Shimon Shiffer) quoted a senior Israeli defense source as 
saying that Hizbullah has established an advanced base in Venezuela, 
from which it is gathering intelligence in South America -- 
especially in Brazil, Argentina, and Peru.  The source was quoted as 
saying that the group is planning a terrorist attack in retaliation 
for the February 2008 assassination of its top operative Imad 
Mughniyah. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that the Central Conference of American 
Rabbis, the largest rabbinic organization of Reform Judaism, has 
urged Israelis to reject Qproposed laws  that would limit the 
citizenship rightsQ of Israeli Arabs and has called on the Israeli 
government to increase funding for Israeli Arab infrastructure and 
education. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that American, German, and Israeli 
students are working together in an archeological project at Ramat 
Rachel, south of Jerusalem (inside the Green Line).  The daily says 
that the 21 American students come from Moravian College and the 
associated Moravian Theological Seminary in eastern Pennsylvania. 
 
HaQaretz reported that the swine flu is rapidly spreading in Israel: 
The Health Ministry said yesterday that the number of people who 
have caught the disease rose 3.6% in the past two weeks.  Half of 
the cases are patients under 30. 
 
Makor Rishon-Hatzofe cited the results of a Rasmussen Reports 
survey: 
- 70% of Americans view Israel as an ally. 
- 80% of Americans say that the Palestinian leaders should recognize 
IsraelQs right to exist. 
 
The Jerusalem Post cited the results of an international survey 
conducted by the International Committee of the Red Cross about the 
60th anniversary of the ratification of the Geneva Conventions.  The 
Israeli poll, carried out by the local polling firm Geocartography, 
shows the vast majority of Israelis have heard of the treaties but 
that 46% don't think they have contributed anything to preventing 
wars from escalating.

"The Secret Sextet" 
 
Senior commentator Ari Shavit wrote in the independent, left-leaning 
Ha'aretz (8/13): QAs everyone knows, Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet is 
a mess.  Big, bloated and mediocre, it is stressed out and 
flip-flopping, running scared and fundamentally flawed.  However, 
this wretched cabinet contains one apparatus worthy of special 
mention -- the sextet. This is the supreme strategic team consisting 
of Netanyahu, Ehud Barak, Avigdor Lieberman, Moshe Ya'alon, Dan 
Meridor, and Benny Begin. The most disturbing information on the 
sextet's agenda regards Iran.  National Security Adviser Uzi Arad 
was right -- the earth is scorched The sextet will have to make 
fatal decisions in the near future.  The world is talking about plan 
A (dialogue) and preparing for plan B (sanctions).  But the dialogue 
is a joke and the sanctions could be too little, too late.  If the 
United States doesn't come to its senses the dilemma will be in plan 
C (to bomb or not to bomb).  This dilemma does not bode well.  So 
the sextet faces a double challenge -- it must think of an 
alternative creative idea on the one hand, and get America to sober 
up on the other.  The democratic rebellion against Iranian President 
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has created a golden opportunity.  Begin, 
Meridor, Ya'alon, Lieberman, Barak, Netanyahu, and Obama must use it 
swiftly and resolutely.

¶I.  "Regards from Bethlehem" 
 
Regional correspondent Ronni Shaked wrote in the mass-circulation, 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot (8/13): QThe new Fatah leadership, which 
is much younger and dynamic, and which is comprised mainly of 
residents of the territories, is the most important achievement that 
was made by the Fatah Central Conference in Bethlehem.... But 
victory at the conference is still not victory on the Palestinian 
street.  In order to win back the public's faith, to restore Fatah's 
lost glory as a national liberation movement, the new leadership is 
going to have to prove first and foremost the absence of 
malfeasance.  The challenges facing this new leadership are on the 
verge of the impossible.... Let no one harbor any illusions.  One 
certainly must take into account the possibility that the new 
leadership of Fatah will be more militant and extreme in its 
demands.  Netanyahu must understand that improving the economy and 
introducing relief measures that ease daily life will not serve as a 
substitute for progress in the negotiations and the establishment of 
an independent Palestinian state.  Ghnaim, Dahlan, Rajoub, Tirawi, 
and Barghouti (irrespective of whether he is released from prison) 
are likely to overcome the enmity among them and to rally around 
them the Palestinians, who currently don't have the energy for 
another Intifada, to join in another round of violence, in the event 
that they should be convinced that they will not be able to get 
Israel to budge by any other means.  Business can be done with the 
new Fatah leadership.  The ball is in our court (as well). 
 
 
 
 
II.  "Outflanking Olmert from the Left" 
 
Settler leader Israel Harel wrote in the independent, left-leaning 
HaQaretz (8/13): QAccording to the hints that [Gilad ShalitQs] 
captors have been leaking by way of the Arab media, the Likud 
government (Likud, of all parties) is planning to pay -- with a few 
cosmetic changes here and there designed to paper over the shame -- 
the price that Ehud Olmert refused to pay.... Putting an end to the 
Shalit stand-off, some say, would allow Israel to focus on the 
really important issue -- Iran.  Yet capitulating to Hamas would 
harm Israel's primary peacetime weapon -- deterrence. Deterrence is 
now Israel's main weapon against Iran, against a terrorist 
escalation by Hamas or Hizbullah, and against the Qbelligerent 
optionsQ entertained by the leaders of Fatah, both Qold guardQ and 
Qyoung guard,Q at their convention.  Surrendering to Hamas would 
deal a grievous blow to this deterrence.  It would also harm the 
government's image in the eyes of the region's other pot-stirrers, 
including the United States, Russia and the European Union.... Gilad 
has to be brought home -- it is our duty.  And he will be brought 
home.  But under no circumstances through capitulation. 
 
III.  "The Palestinians ArenQt Suckers, Either" 
 
Liberal columnist Larry Derfner wrote in the conservative, 
independent Jerusalem Post (8/13): Q[Netanyahu] just can't expect 
Abbas, as president of the Palestinian Authority, to cooperate.... 
Why should he want to negotiate a new deal when he's being told it 
won't be anywhere near as fair as the one he turned down last year, 
or even the one his predecessor turned down nine years ago?  Yes, 
Palestinian leaders are an obstinate breed.  While I don't blame 
Abbas or Arafat for rejecting Israel's offers -- we're pretty 
exacting when it comes to land disputes, too -- I blame them for 
refusing ever to acknowledge publicly that Israel was sincerely 
trying to reach an agreement.  Such an acknowledgment could have 
improved the climate for peacemaking tremendously.  However, while 
Abbas, like Yasser Arafat before him, has been obstinate, he has 
never done what Netanyahu is doing now -- wiped the slate clean and 
presented a new offer that marks a wholesale retreat from what his 
side was offering before.... The sad thing is that Netanyahu and 
most Israelis think we're being reasonable and Abbas is being 
radical, or rejectionist, or maximalist or something.  I wish Abbas 
would take my advice and negotiate with us in kind, treating Israel 
as Qdisputed territoryQ just as Netanyahu treats the West Bank.  It 
might be a learning experience for us. It might teach us a little 
humility, show us that we're not the only people who can claim 
rights to land around here.  It's not going to happen, of course. 
We are at a stalemate in the peace process.  I just hope that in 
trying to break this stalemate, the Obama administration doesn't 
flinch from the truth that today, the main obstacle to peace is not 
in Ramallah, it's in Jerusalem.
