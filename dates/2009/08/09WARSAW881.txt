Accompanied by a representative from the Russian Embassy in 
Warsaw, we notified Lukasz Zielinski and Szymon Bochenski of 
the Polish MFA's Security Policy Department that the UN 
Office on Drugs and Crime was now an official observer in the 
Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT). 
Zielinski responded that Poland welcomed U.S. and Russian 
cooperative efforts to enhance the work of the GICNT.
