SUBJECT: TRANSFER OF POLICE TRAINING CONTRACT TO CSTC-A 
 
REF: KABUL 2327 
 
¶1.  ACTION REQUESTED:  PARA 6. 
 
¶2.  IN RESPONSE TO REFTEL, AN INTERAGENCY MEETING ON 
AFGHANISTAN-PAKISTAN WAS HELD ON AUGUST 10 TO DISCUSS THE 
TRANSFER OF MOST POLICE TRAINING RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE 
DOD COMBINED SECURITY TRANSITION COMMAND-AFGHANISTAN 
(CSTC-A).  THIS TRANSFER OF RESPONSIBILITY WILL TAKE PLACE 
ON JANUARY 31, 2010 WHEN THE CURRENT INL CONTRACT PERIOD OF 
PERFORMANCE ENDS, AND DOD/CSTC-A HAS A REPLACEMENT CONTRACT 
IN PLACE.  DEPARTMENT REQUESTS THAT POST WORK WITH CSTC-A 
TO PREPARE FOR A SEAMLESS TRANSITION IN JANUARY. UNDER THE NEW 
ARRANGEMENT,THE CHIEF OF MISSION (COM) WOULD CONTINUE TO 
PROVIDE 
POLICE PROGRAM POLICY, OVERSIGHT AND BROAD DIRECTION, WHILE 
CSTC-A WOULD HAVE OVERALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR IMPLEMENTING 
THE POLICY, INCLUDING CONTRACTING AND CONTRACT MANAGEMENT. 
 
¶3.  RECOGNIZING THAT HIGH ATTRITION RATES, HIGH DRUG ABUSE 
RATES, AND LOW LITERACY RATES ARE SYSTEMIC PROBLEMS THAT 
IMPEDE THE LONG-TERM PROSPECTS FOR STANDING UP AN 
AFGHAN-SUSTAINED NATIONAL POLICE FORCE, INL WILL USE ITS 
CIVILIAN POLICING EXPERTISE TO INITIATE ADVANCED TRAINING 
COURSES AND PROGRAMS FOCUSED ON RETENTION AND 
SUSTAINABILITY IN THE ANP TO COMPLEMENT THE OVERALL 
TRAINING AND SECURITY FOCUS OF DOD/CSTC-A. 
 
¶4.  THE ADVANCED PROGRAM WOULD HAVE THREE COMPONENTS:  (1) 
TRAINING, WITH ADVANCED COURSES IN LEADERSHIP AND 
MANAGEMENT, INSTRUCTOR DEVELOPMENT, WOMEN,S POLICING, AND 
RULE OF LAW; (2) ADVISING IN THE MINISTRY OF INTERIOR 
FOCUSED ON TRAINING AND RECRUITING/RETENTION (TO COMPLEMENT 
EXISTING CSTC-A ADVISING); AND (3) FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMS TO 
TEACH LITERACY AND COMBAT DRUG ABUSE. 
 
¶5.  TO START UP THIS PROGRAM UNTIL INL OUTYEAR FUNDING CAN BE 
REQUESTED, INL WILL SEEK $40 MILLION FROM DOD AFGHAN 
SECURITY FORCES FUND (ASFF).  IN ADDITION, INL WILL NEED TO 
RETAIN SPACE AT THE POLICE REGIONAL TRAINING CENTERS (RTCS) 
FOR ITS JUSTICE SECTOR SUPPORT PROGRAM (JSSP) AND 
CORRECTIONS SYSTEM SUPPORT PROGRAM (CSSP).  BEFORE CONTROL 
OF THE RTCS IS TRANSFERRED TO CSTC-A, IT WILL BE VITAL TO 
GUARANTEE CONTINUED RTC SUPPORT FOR THESE PROGRAMS 
IN THE PROVINCES WITH ADVISOR LIVING SPACE, OFFICE SPACE, 
CLASSROOM SPACE, AND BARRACKS SPACE.  INL WILL ALSO REQUIRE 
LIMITED SPACE IN CURRENT TRAINING CENTERS TO CARRY ON 
ADVANCED POLICE TRAINING AND FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMS. 
 
¶6.  ACTION REQUESTED:  POST IS REQUESTED TO SEEK CSTC-A 
AGREEMENT TO RETAIN SPACE AT RTCS FOR THE JSSP AND CSSP 
PROGRAMS, AND NEGOTIATE ADDITIONAL SPACE FOR A SMALL-SCALE 
ADVANCED POLICE TRAINING PROGRAM.  INL WILL DISCUSS 
POSSIBILITY OF SECURING $40 MILLION IN ASFF AS AN INTERIM 
FUNDING MEASURE WITH DOD.
