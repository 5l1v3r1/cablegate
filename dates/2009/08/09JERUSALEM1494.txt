Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
All front pages report on the Israeli "Peace Now" movement stating 
that settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is 
still underway despite Israeli claims of a freeze in new tenders. 
The reports note that approximately 600 housing units and outposts 
have been constructed in the West Bank since the beginning of the 
year. The reports also add that the Israeli government intends to 
construct a new 104-unit settlement in the Ras Al-Amoud neighborhood 
in East Jerusalem. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front pages news on Israeli Prime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu noting on August 23 that he hopes to see progress 
in pursuing negotiations between the Palestinians and Israelis by 
the end of September 2009. Netanyahu's remarks came prior to 
departing for a meeting with US Special Envoy George Mitchell in 
London. 
 
Al-Ayyam reports on Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman 
criticizing President Obama's vision for achieving peace in the 
Middle East. Lieberman said that the establishment of a Palestinian 
state in two years is an "unrealistic goal" and added that he 
doesn't expect to see any peace settlement before 2025, according to 
coverage. 
 
All front pages report on Palestinian condemnation of the Israeli 
decision to allow Jewish groups to enter the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound 
during Ramadan under the full protection of the Israeli police. The 
Al-Aqsa Foundation for Waqf and Heritage issued a statement in which 
it noted that this entry is unprecedented during Ramadan. 
 
Al-Quds front pages news citing London media reports that 
representatives from Hamas, Fatah and Israel attended a three-day 
workshop in Switzerland to discuss the best mechanisms for 
supporting the peace process. Hamas officials denied the group's 
participation in the workshop and noted that the invitations were 
extended to individuals and not to factions.

Weekend Stories:

Sunday, August 23 
 
Al Ayyam front pages news that the postponement of the Palestinian 
national dialogue for several days from its currently-scheduled date 
of August 25 is becoming more likely. Palestinian sources added that 
the next round of national dialogue will be postponed until after 
the Palestinian National Council (PNC) session, scheduled for August 
26 and 27 in Ramallah. Meanwhile, Al Quds and Al Hayat Al Jadida 
newspapers reported that Egypt will continue its shuttle diplomacy 
rounds between Ramallah and Damascus to iron out the differences 
among the Palestinian factions in preparation for inviting them all 
to Cairo following the month of Ramadan to sign the reconciliation 
agreement and announce the end of the state of Palestinian division. 
 
 
Al Quds runs a story on an Israeli government plan to build a new 
settlement in East Jerusalem in the Ras Al Amoud neighbourhood 
opposite the Maale Zeitim settlement. The new plan will be submitted 
soon to the local committee for planning and construction within the 
 
JERUSALEM 00001494  002 OF 003 
 
 
municipality of Jerusalem, according to coverage. The Ir-Amim 
Society received a copy of the plan and said that 104 settlement 
units will be built in addition to the construction of a synagogue, 
kindergarten, and a sports club to serve the settlers. The plan, 
according to Ir-Amim, will be implemented on the former site of the 
Israeli Police Headquarters. Before 1967, the buildings were the 
headquarters for the Jordanian police. 
 
All dailies front page news that PA Prime Minister Salam Fayyad 
denied the existence of any political prisoners held by the PA. 
Fayyad said that those detained have violated the law and are being 
treated according to the law. Meanwhile, Maan news agency reported 
that President Mahmoud Abbas has ordered the release of 200 Hamas 
prisoners from PA prisons immediately to mark the start of the holy 
month of Ramadan. Maan quoted Palestinian sources describing this 
decision as part of the President's efforts to create a positive 
atmosphere to start the next round of national dialogue talks. 
 
Al Ayyam runs a front page story on Ambassador Mohammad Sbeih, 
Assistant Secretary General of the Arab League for the affairs of 
Palestine and occupied Arab territories, stating that the 
Palestinian question will be on top of the agenda of the ministerial 
meeting of the Arab League scheduled for September 9-10. Sbeih said 
in a statement to the press yesterday that the issue of Jerusalem 
will be one of the urgent matters that will be discussed during the 
meeting and speculated that the Arab League will go back to the UN 
soon to discuss Israeli violations in Jerusalem and the accelerated 
rate of attacks by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the 
city. 
 
Saturday, August 22 
Al Hayat Al Jadida and Al Quds front page stories on President 
Barack Obama's message to Muslims during which he congratulated them 
for the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan and promised to take 
tangible measures to renew the relations between the US and the 
Muslim world and to give constant support to the two-state solution. 
 
 
All three dailies carry front page news from a Palestinian source 
that the Egyptian security delegation which held consultations with 
Palestinian factions in Ramallah and Damascus proposed holding 
presidential and legislative elections prior to reaching a 
reconciliation agreement. Palestinian sources said that Hamas 
quickly rejected the proposal while the majority of the PLO 
factions, particularly Fatah, agreed to it. 
 
Al Hayat Al Jadida carries a front page story on Israel and the 
Palestinians trading blame over the failure to resume peace talks. A 
senior Israeli official said that Palestinians refused repeated 
calls from Prime Minister Netanyahu to resume peace talks adding 
that "the government of Israel has been calling upon Palestinians 
for weeks to come back to the negotiating table. The Palestinian 
side is preventing this resumption by placing unprecedented 
pre-conditions." Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat denied 
these accusations and added that Palestinians are not placing new 
conditions, but that Israel is undermining and disregarding their 
own pledges to stop settlement activity in the West Bank and East 
Jerusalem.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Adli Sadeq opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily under the 
 
JERUSALEM 00001494  003 OF 003 
 
 
title, "No return to deceptive negotiations" (08/24): "It looks like 
Netanyahu and his government will be solving their problems with 
Obama's administration concerning settlement construction. Once this 
happens, we will be asked to go back to negotiations. In order for 
us not to go back to negotiations that lack a clear agenda and clear 
timeframe, we need to form a strong and unified Arab position that 
supports our position." 
 
2) Mouhammad Awad opines in Al-Quds independent daily under the 
title "Is there truly a new beginning?" (08/24): "President Obama 
realized from the beginning that dialogue has to replace all other 
means to address conflicts, but this dialogue needs active partners 
with whom the US builds its relations based on mutual interests. He 
made this clear during his speech in Cairo, but the question remains 
- how long will Obama use the dialogue policy in addressing regional 
conflicts?"
