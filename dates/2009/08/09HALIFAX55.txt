SUBJECT: ANOTHER SUNDAY, ANOTHER STORM:  PREPARATIONS FOR TROPICAL 
STORM DANNY 
 
REF: HALIFAX 53 
 
 
¶1.  Tropical Storm Danny is projected to make landfall in 
Halifax's consular district early in the morning of August 30, 
almost exactly a week to the day after -- and likely on a 
similar track to --  Hurricane Bill.  Although Danny is 
currently expected to be less powerful than Bill, our advice to 
personnel and the public remains the same as in reftel:  shelter 
at home during the storm and prepare for a possible loss of 
power of up to 48 hours.  People living on or near water are 
advised to move to higher ground. 
 
¶2.  Other preparations for Bill noted in reftel have been or 
will be taken shortly for Danny. 
 
¶3.  Hurricane Bill did little damage and caused no loss of life 
in the district, although there were some close calls where 
individuals failed to heed warnings to stay away from the ocean 
and were knocked in the water by strong waves.  We expect public 
safety employees to be even more vigorous this weekend in 
enforcing beach and road closures to prevent crowds from 
gathering at potentially dangerous vantage points.  Public 
awareness of, and preparations for, the storm are high, as is 
the response capability of emergency management organizations in 
the consular district.
