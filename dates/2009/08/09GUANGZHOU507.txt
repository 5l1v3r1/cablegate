¶1. (SBU) Summary: Visa outreach and the need for 
increased cooperation on establishing travel 
document authenticity were among the key topics 
raised during Consul General Brian Goldbeck's 
initial trip to Fujian's provincial capital of 
Fuzhou, August 12-14. (See ref A for overview and 
other issues.)  Discussions with officials and 
businesses revealed that additional outreach 
activities are needed to help combat inaccurate 
visa-related information for three main groups of 
travelers Q business leaders concerned about SAO- 
related application delays, students victimized by 
touts, and legitimate tourists interested in 
spending their travel dollars in the United States. 
Public security and border control officials said 
they want to increase anti-fraud cooperation and 
requested Consulate training on the security 
features of U.S. official documents to help prevent 
human smuggling.  End Summary. 
 
Welcoming Legitimate Travel to the United States 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Visa issues and the importance of 
facilitating legitimate travel were raised in 
several meetings during the Consul General's first 
trip to Fujian.  These issues were discussed with Su 
Zengtian, acting Mayor of Fuzhou, Fuzhou Foreign 
Affairs Office (FAO), Entry-Exit Division of the 
Public Security Bureau, local members of the 
American Chamber of Commerce in South China, and 
administrators at Fuzhou University.  In each 
meeting, the CG emphasized how fraudulent documents 
and illegal immigration hurt legitimate travelers. 
Fujian interlocutors expressed interest in continued 
dialogue between the Consulate and Fujian citizens 
as a method to combat misinformation on immigration 
issues. 
 
Business Leaders Support Increased Visa Outreach 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶3. (SBU) American Chamber of Commerce in South China 
members in Fujian Province expressed concern about 
perceived and actual delays involved in the issuance 
of some business travel visas.  They noted that 
certain employees had been unable to receive visas 
in time to attend planned events or conferences, 
especially those with hi-tech backgrounds (ref B). 
One Amcham member told the CG that some of his 
employees experienced wait times as long as 16 weeks 
earlier this year.  Business leaders also expressed 
concern that the clearance process is perceived as 
stricter for applicants from Fujian Province because 
of its reputation as a center for illegal 
immigration (refs D and E).  The CG responded to 
these concerns by clarifying current procedures and 
wait times which he indicated are now down to 
approximately four weeks (ref B).  Comment: 
However, the persistence of these concerns shows 
that additional visa outreach to the Fujian business 
community is necessary to provide accurate, up-to- 
date information on avoiding clearance-related 
delays and to facilitate trade and business 
exchange.  End comment.  Amcham members welcomed the 
Consulate's offer to visit and explain current 
policies and procedures in the near future.

Student Visa Outreach at Fuzhou University 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (SBU) Visa outreach was also discussed during the 
Consul General's meeting with officials from Fuzhou 
University, home of 25,000 students.  Although 
university officials have previously turned down 
Consulate offers to provide visa-related information 
directly to students, Vice President Wang Jian said 
the university is prepared to allow consulate 
officers to visit and conduct visa-related outreach. 
The CG stressed that legitimate students are hurt 
through misinformation provided by unscrupulous 
brokers who insert themselves into the visa 
application process.  Such misleading information 
has led some students to purchase fraudulent 
documents or misrepresent themselves, which resulted 
in some students being permanently barred from 
entering the United States. 
 
Expanded Law Enforcement Cooperation Sought 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) In an introductory meeting with Deputy 
Director Xiao Yuanhong of the Entry and Exit 
Administration of the Fujian Provincial Public 
Security Department (PSD), the CG, accompanied by 
A/RSO (ARSO-I), LES Investigator, Consoff, TDoff, 
and Econoff, expressed his gratitude for successful 
cooperation on a series of recent joint fraud 
investigations.  Both the CG and Director Xiao 
agreed that further law enforcement cooperation and 
direct communication between the Consulate and 
Fujian PSD is essential in combating illegal 
immigration. Deputy Director Bian Zhiqiang of the 
Fujian Border Control Armed Police Force expressed 
interest in the Consulate's offer conduct local 
training sessions to immigration officials and 
border control authorities recognize and prevent the 
usage of counterfeit and forged U.S. travel 
documents.  Director Bian noted that while his 
department would clearly benefit from additional 
training, it would require the approval of his 
superiors in Beijing.  Follow-up coordination with 
the Fujian Armed Police Force is being handled by 
post ARSO-I. 
 
Comment: Local Officials Still Key to Outreach 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶6. (SBU) Most of our Fujian interlocutors agreed 
that business and student travel was good for U.S.- 
China relations, as well as for the economic growth 
of Fujian province.  Furthermore, most agreed that 
additional outreach would help stem the spread of 
the misinformation that is especially virulent in 
certain areas of Fujian Province.  However, one 
prominent FAO official who, unfortunately, also 
serves as an important "gatekeeper" for the approval 
of public affairs outreach to Fuzhou Universities 
opined that there really isn't a need for increased 
dialogue between the Consulate and students.  She 
asserted that students who purchased fake documents 
were the ones at fault and seemed unwilling to 
address the fact that Consular outreach could fight 
misinformation and the reliance on unscrupulous visa 
brokers.  End Comment.
