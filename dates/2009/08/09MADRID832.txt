SUBJECT: SPAIN'S STATEMENT ON AUNG SAN SUU KYI CONVICTION 
 
REF: SECSTATE 83598 
 
(U) Per reftel demarche, in a statement released August 11, 
the Spanish Ministry for Foreign Affairs condemned Aung San 
Suu Kyi's conviction, calling the trial "politically 
motivated" and lacking minimal procedural guarantees and the 
sentence "completely unjust."  The statement calls on the 
Burmese authorities to pay heed to the international 
community's demand for an open, democratic process and 
inclusion of all political forces and ethnic groups, and the 
GOS demands the immediate release of Suu Kyi and the 
remaining prisoners of conscious in Burma.
