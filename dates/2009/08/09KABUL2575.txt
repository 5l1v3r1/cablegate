¶4.  (SBU) The most newsworthy event other than the release of the 
tallies was provided by Basherdost, who before the press conference 
began, stood up in the front row, brandished a copy of the election 
law, and objected to the authority of the IEC to release the results 
day by day.  Dr. Najafi of the IEC quickly responded, brandishing 
his own copy of the law, and asserting that the process was indeed 
in compliance with the law.
