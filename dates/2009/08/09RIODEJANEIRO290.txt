SUBJECT: Rio Radar - August 28, 2009 
 
¶1. (U) Rio Radar is a weekly compilation of key economic, political, 
commercial, and other developments in the states of Rio de Janeiro, 
Bahia, Minas Gerais, Espirito Santo, and Sergipe.  This week's 
subjects: 
 
PRESALT OIL ROYALTIES ISSUE DIVIDES GOVERNORS IN RIO CONSULAR 
DISTRICT 
 
¶2. (U) On August 25, Globo, Rio's newspaper of record, reported that 
Rio de Janeiro Governor Sergio Cabral (PMDB party) and Minas Gerais 
Governor Aecio Neves (PSDB party) disagreed over how the pre-salt 
oil regulatory framework should address distribution of royalties. 
According to the report, Cabral stated, "We are going to fight with 
all democratic instruments available to us against national 
distribution of resources."  Governor Neves responded that all 
states of Brazil need to benefit from royalty payments, in order to 
avoid "greater developmental distortions between certain states and 
regions." 
 
¶3. (U) In an apparent sign of protest to rumors that President 
Lula's Administration (PT party) would not introduce the royalty 
issue in the new regulatory framework to avoid political conflicts 
(and thus hold up Congressional passage), Rio Governor Cabral and 
Espirito Santo Governor Paulo Hartung (PMDB party) publicly declined 
President Lula's invitation to an August 31 announcement ceremony of 
the reform package, in Brasilia. (Note: Rio de Janeiro and Esprito 
Santo are responsible for 90 percent of Brazil's oil production and 
would stand to lose a significant amount of revenue if other states 
share in the pre-salt oil royalties under the new regulations.  For 
Rio de Janeiro, which along with spirito Santo, receives the lion's 
share of royalties and taxes, this could represent a loss of 14 
billion Brazilian Reals - 7.5 billion USD - per year. End Note). 
Minister of Mines and Energy Edison Lobao (PMDB party) subsequently 
made conflicting statements as to whether or not the Lula 
Administration will include the royalties issue in the upcoming 
regulatory framework. 
 
RIO GOVERNOR INTENDS TO 'PACIFY' 30 ADDITIONAL FAVELAS WITHIN NEXT 
YEAR 
 
¶4. (SBU) Wilson Carlos de Carvalho, a senior official advising Rio 
Governor Cabral on security, told us on August 28 that state and 
local security forces intend to occupy and maintain control of some 
30 favelas within the next year.  The commander for BOPE, the state 
military police's special operations unit, told us on August 19 that 
his forces intended to occupy at least three favelas by the end of 
the year (Note: Rio state Pacification Police, or UPP, currently 
maintain a presence in four favelas throughout Rio de Janeiro.  End 
Note).  Carvalho said the state intends to dedicate an additional 
3,500 new police academy recruits to this effort over the next year. 
 
 
RIO STATE BRINGS CLASSICAL MUSIC TO FAVELAS...BUT WHAT ABOUT 
SERVICES? 
 
¶5. (SBU) As part of Rio State's favela "pacification" strategy, the 
Symphonic Orchestra of Rio de Janeiro's Municipal Theater performed 
at Cidade de Deus (City of God), a favela immortalized by the 2002 
film of the same name.  A community leader of the Batan favela told 
us on August 19 that music performances were also taking place in 
that community.  At the same time, Colonel Jose Vieira, commander of 
the Pacification Police (UPP) said his troops last week had to quell 
"near-rioting" crowds of residents demanding basic services in one 
of the other two favelas the UPP currently controls.
