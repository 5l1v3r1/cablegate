REF: A. STATE 126914 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post regrets to inform Department that on February 
4, PRC Ministry of Public Security unexpectedly cancelled its 
participation in upcoming ILEA Bangkok Supervisory Criminal 
Investigators Course (SCIC) Session 26 February 16 to March 
27, 2009. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post has nothing to indicate that this decision 
represents a Chinese decision not to participate in future 
ILEA Bangkok courses.  Instead, a miscommunication within the 
Ministry of Public Security appears to have caused the 
cancellation. 
 
¶3. (U) Post is working with its counterparts at the Ministry 
of Public Security to avoid such a cancellation in the future.
