Classified By: Ambassador Frank C. Urbancic, Reasons 1.4 (b), (d) 
 
¶1.  (U) Status of Ship:  No changes since last report. 
 
¶2.  (C) Diplomatic Activity:  Ambassador on February 2 spoke 
with RoC Diplomatic Coordinator Leonidas Pantelides regarding 
latest developments on Monchegorsk.  Contradicting recent 
messages from the Foreign Ministry regarding the 
applicability of UNSCR 1747, Pantelides claimed there was no 
doubt the Monchegorsk was carrying proscribed materiel.  That 
said, Cyprus needed "a blue flag (United Nations) solution," 
or otherwise would prefer to send the cargo back to source 
country Iran.  He dismissed any option that entailed 
transferring the shipment to a third party without UN cover, 
such as the German offer reported on February 2 (Reftel). 
Giving the cargo to Germany would be acceptable, he 
clarified, but only with authorization from the UN. 
Pantelides expected the RoC to report its inspection findings 
to the UNSC Iran Sanctions Committee (ISC) before week's end, 
perhaps as early as February 4.  The message would include 
not only the results of the government's inspection, but also 
questions posed to the ISC regarding disposition of the 
Monchegorsk cargo.  Pantelides noted the RoC had consulted 
with the Russians and Chinese in New York and had been 
assured that there would be no difficulties.  Ambassador 
emphasized that the U.S. believed Cyprus should report a 
violation to the Council without open-ended questions; 
returning the cargo to Iran was a bad option, he added. 
 
¶3.  (C) Ambassador also discussed next steps with resident UK 
High Commissioner Peter Millett.  Millett hours earlier had 
engaged RoC Foreign Minister Markos Kyprianou to urge the 
Cypriots to report only their inspection findings to the ISC 
and specifically not seek guidance for proceeding.  However, 
in the face of what appeared to be a near-imminent Cypriot 
decision not to report and perhaps let the boat leave, 
Millett's message apparently softened, focusing instead on 
the necessity of referring the matter to New York regardless 
of wording.  Kyprianou claimed that "these people" -- 
pointing at President Demetris Christofias and fellow AKEL 
party glitterati -- had allowed the Monchegorsk to become an 
ideological, David versus Goliath affair, with "little 
Cyprus" naturally cozying up to Syria's David.  Such an 
interpretation did not bode well for a solution acceptable to 
the U.S., Britain, and others, the Minister concluded. 
 
¶4.  (C) As to immediate next steps, Millett raised the idea 
of coordinated telephone calls from P-3-plus-one capitals to 
Christofias, at the PolDir level.
