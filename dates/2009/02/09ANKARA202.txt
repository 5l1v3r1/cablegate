REF: ANKARA 000128 
 
¶1. Summary:  Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) provided 
Embassy with the requests for cooperation on EXBS and 
nonproliferation-related issues based on extensive GOT 
interagency deliberations following the 
EXBS/Nonproliferation Seminar held in Ankara September 2008. 
The GOT interagency desires more peer-to-peer engagement with 
US experts, an Analysis of Strategic Commodity Transfers 
course (State 007751), exchange of information on US programs 
for Government to Industry Outreach, and a Targeting and Risk 
Management workshop.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. Completed Actions for the Reporting Period: 
 
¶A. Meetings During Recent Reporting Period by EXBS Advisor 
and Coordinator: 
 
1) Jan 7 - We met with MFA Nonproliferation and Disarmament 
Department Head Elif Ulgen to review results of EXBS Seminar 
and the upcoming visit to the southern border with Syria and 
the Port of Mersin. Ulgen provided a detailed list of 
activities that the GOT interagency would like to undertake 
during CY 2009.  The list of activities included an Analysis 
of Strategic Commodity Transfers Workshop in Ankara in March, 
an US Experts professional exchange of information on US 
programs for Government to Industry Outreach in Ankara as 
early as April, a DHS/CBP Targeting and Risk Management 
workshop to be held as early as May, and ongoing peer-to-peer 
professional exchanges for law enforcement programs, both in 
the US and in Turkey.  The interagency also requested more 
information on XRF and WMD Controlled Delivery programs 
before deciding whether to accept these programs.  Ulgen said 
the GOT is not prepared at this time to move forward on any 
of the other proposals raised by US participants during the 
EXBS seminar.  Ref cable contains a more detailed report of 
GOT interagency response to the EXBS/Nonproliferation Seminar. 
 
2) Jan 14 - Denise Marsh, Department of State Senior Desk 
Officer for Turkey.  Advisor provided Ms. Marsh with an 
overview of existing Export Control and Border Security 
systems in Turkey and briefed her on the new Export Control 
legislation pending in Parliament, including a review of past 
and current EXBS  and SLD initiatives for Turkey. 
 
3) Jan 29 - Mehmet Guzel, Deputy Director General (DDG) 
Turkish Customs Enforcement.  Advisor discussed the finding 
reported by the Interagency for future EXBS initiatives. 
Advisor noted that DG Neset Akkoc had indicated a strong 
desire for both a WMD Controlled Delivery course and two 
International Border Interdiction programs, both land and 
rail, which are to be held at the port of entry on the 
Bulgarian border this spring, but that the interagency noted 
that these program where not required at this time.  Guzel 
agreed to confirm what the actual desire of the DG is and 
would also look at providing us with an updated list of 
enforcement equipment needed by Customs Enforcement officers 
in the field.  During this meeting, we also confirmed details
