------- 
 
Â¶5.  (SBU)  By all accounts the first day's session of this 
first-ever genocide tribunal in Cambodia went well, but the 
proceedings also raised a concern about the length of time it 
is taking to wade through issues raised by civil party 
lawyers.  On the other hand, the judges could be seen to 
confer together on the bench and to appear to make strategic 
choices together about how to decide on matters, if not to 
reach decisions on substance immediately.  Only time will 
tell how problematic the participation of the 12 civil party 
attorneys proves to be.
