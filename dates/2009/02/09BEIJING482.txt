  Editorial Quotes

¶1. FINANCIAL CRISIS 
 
a. "Whomever saves the most energy, will be the first to recover 
from the crisis" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(02/25): "Energy conservation is not only 
about saving energy; it drives internal consumption and alleviates 
external pressure. Energy conservation has a far greater influence 
during a financial crisis. The new energy policy of President Obama 
intends to be more influential. Energy conservation will not only 
bring large economic benefits, but it will also bring social 
benefits. Among Obama's economic stimulus plan, about 150$ billion 
will be used to improve energy efficiency. China's current efforts 
towards economic recovery are facing great challenges because it is 
difficult for China to enlarge its exports. Therefore, the quickest 
method, where by the government can improve its energy conservation 
is through various state-owned companies. This is the best way for 
China to step out of the crisis." 
 
b. "Facing crisis, what kind of attitudes do we need" 
 
21 Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao) under Guangdong 
21 century publishing company Ltd. (02/25): "On February 17th the 
U.S.- China Economic and Security review held a hearing to address 
China's role in the origin and response to the global recession. 
Only the Chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia backed up his approach with 
statistics. If people can give numbers and talk sense, no matter 
what the conclusions are, it helps us to understand the core of the 
problem. While on the other hand, when one says something like 
Paulson did, blaming the Chinese people's savings habits; and 
Geithner blaming China for manipulating its currency; these 
statements, without providing convincing figures, may sound 
straightforward. But they are useless for solving the problem. 
Paulson and Geithner only criticize without providing statistics and 
numbers. This behavior doesn't help solve the problem." 
 
¶2. U.S. POLITICS 
 
"Chinese American may head Commerce Department" 
 
The official English-language newspaper China Daily (02/25): "Yin 
Chengde, a former diplomat at the Chinese Embassy in the U.S., said 
Obama's nominations of Chinese American's reflects he 
strategy.'Obama is a mixed blood president. So, he is more open when 
it comes to naming a talent with yellow skin to a high position.' It 
is highly possible that the U.S. president has taken Beijing's role 
into consideration while making the decision. 'The move would 
definitely facilitate cooperation between the two sides, especially 
in the energy and commerce fields which are high on the agendas of 
the two governments.'"
