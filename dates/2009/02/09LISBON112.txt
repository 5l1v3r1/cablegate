(SBU) We discussed reftel points with Portuguese MFA 
interlocutors.  They noted that, having recently made the 
decision to withdraw the Portuguese contribution, they were 
unlikely to reverse course.  They said they would, however, 
consider the issue within relevant offices in Lisbon and 
Brussels.
