¶1. (SBU) Summary.  The U.S. informed the JCG that, on 
February 13, Russia had rejected a request by the United 
States to conduct a CFE inspection.  Calling the Russian 
Federation's continuing rejection of inspections a clear act 
of non-compliance, the U.S. urged Russia to work 
cooperatively with other concerned CFE States Parties to 
reach an agreement on the basis of the Parallel Actions 
Package.  Allies voiced their support for the U.S. statement 
while Russia remained silent.  End summary. 
 
IT'S ABOUT YOUR NONCOMPLIANCE...COMRADE

¶2.  (SBU) The February 17, 2009 JCG Plenary met under the 
Chairmanship of Turkey.  The U.S. announced that on February 
13, Russia had rejected a request by the United States to 
conduct a CFE inspection.  As in the last meeting, USDEL 
pointed out to Russia that 29 States Parties are fully 
complying with the provisions of the CFE Treaty and that 
Russia's rejections are clear acts of non-compliance with its 
Treaty obligations.  USDEL urged Russia to work cooperatively 
with all concerned CFE States Parties to reach agreement on 
the basis of the Parallel Actions Package so that all can 
preserve the benefits of the landmark regime.

¶3.  (SBU) In a series of short interventions, Allies 
(Romania, Germany, Poland, the UK, the Czech Republic, Italy, 
Turkey, and France) expressed regret and disappointment at 
Russia's rejection and voiced their support for the U.S. 
statement.  Romania (Matei) was concerned with the continuous 
erosion of the CFE regime.  Germany (Richter) called CFE an 
anchor of stability that must be maintained.  Italy (Landi) 
was upset at the "problem plaguing the CFE Treaty," and 
Turkey hoped that there would be progress in 2009. 
 
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?

¶4.  (SBU) Russian Chief Arms Control Delegate Mikhail Ulyanov 
was not present at the Plenary.  The Russian representative 
in the chair remained silent as Allies piled on their 
disapproval of Russian inspection rejection. 
 
¶5.  (U) The next JCG meeting will take place on February 24 
under Ukraine's Chairmanship.
