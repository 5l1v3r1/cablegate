¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted 
a pre license check (PLC) at Castle Peak Power Company, 147 Argyle 
Street, Kowloon, Hong Kong (Castle Peak).  The items in question are 
various gate valves and parts classified under export control

biological weapons reasons (CB).  ITT Industries of Amory 
Massachusetts is the license applicant for these items (BIS license

It provides electricity to approximately seventy percent of Hong

Lee, Senior Project Engineer, Emission Control Project, CLP Power 
Hong Kong Limited and Mr. Zhang, Shu Wen, Manager of the Procurement 
Department of Wuhan Kaidi Electric Power Environmental Co., Ltd. 
Mr. Lee provided background on Castle Peak's flue gas 
desulphurization plant project consistent with the information 
provided in reftel A.  He also introduced Mr. Zhang, who is the 
representative of Wuhan Kaidi Electric Power Company.  That company 
was awarded the engineering procurement and construction contract to 
build the desulphurization plant.  The valves and valve parts will 
be used in the building project and Mr. Zhang and Mr. Lee confirmed 
that the valves and parts will be used only in this project in Hong 
Kong and will not be shipped to mainland China.

is a suitable recipient of U.S. origin controlled technology.
