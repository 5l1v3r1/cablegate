     ¶B. 08 BERLIN 1411 
 
¶1.  The NATO accession protocols for Croatia and Albania have 
already been approved by both houses of the German Parliament 
and signed by President Horst Koehler.  A notice to this 
effect was published in the German Legal Gazette on December 
¶31.  The only remaining step is for Germany to deposit the 
instruments of ratification in Washington. 
 
¶2.  MFA NATO Office Director Bernhard Schlagheck told post 
January 30 that this final step would probably be carried out 
within the next two weeks, but in any case, no later than the 
end of February.  He saw absolutely no obstacles or 
impediments to achieving this.
