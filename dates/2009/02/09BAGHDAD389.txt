REF: SECSTATE-CROCKER TELCON FEBRUARY 8, 2009 
 
¶1.  (SBU) As we discussed in our telephone call on Sunday, February 
8, the Provincial Reconstruction Teams in Iraq have been essential 
to the emerging democracy in this country.  The January 31 
provincial elections succeeded in no small measure because of the 
civil society organizations and women's groups the PRTs have 
mentored, and the voter education programs they have sponsored.  The 
election results - favoring new faces and secular parties - showed 
that Iraqi citizens want transparent, accountable local government 
and that they are increasingly willing to look beyond sectarian 
identification.  The PRTs will capitalize on these results, working 
with new provincial leaders to offer training in accountable 
governance and to reinforce anti-corruption messages. 
 
---------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------- 
 
¶2.  (U) The State Department established the Iraq PRT program in 
June 2005 to strengthen the capabilities of provincial governments, 
assist in coordinating USG reconstruction and development assistance 
efforts, provide enhanced reporting on political developments, and 
advocate U.S. policy goals.  The PRT program's five-pronged focus on 
governance, political development, reconciliation, rule of law and 
economic development advances grassroots democracy and government 
accountability in all eighteen of Iraq's provinces. 
 
¶3.  (U) Although Iraq's Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC) 
organized the January 31, 2009 elections, the PRTs plowed much of 
the ground.  They sponsored voter registration and education and 
civil society development programs.  The PRTs also served as the 
platform from which 400 international observers confirmed the 
credibility and legitimacy of the elections. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
KEY PRT ACTIVITIES TO PROMOTE DEMOCRACY 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) The PRT program in Iraq has promoted democracy and 
transparent government since its inception.  PRTs have fostered the 
development of NGOs and civil society organizations, worked with 
women's groups, supported voter education, and brokered contacts 
between national and local level officials and between officials and 
constituents. 
 
------------------------------------- 
FOSTERING CIVIL SOCIETY ORGANIZATIONS 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (U) PRT Baghdad helped fund and train staff of the Baghdad 
Provincial Council's newspaper, the Baghdaduna, which has 
highlighted the role of local government in Iraq.  The PRT is 
implementing two large Public Diplomacy grants that will train 135 
Iraqi journalists in reporting on local government. 
 
 
¶6.  (U)PRT Baghdad funded NGOs that disseminated IHEC-approved voter 
materials including: 6,054 radio ads on 16 stations; 317 television 
ads on 9 stations; 634 newspaper ads in 32 papers; 258,000 flyers; 
60,000 posters; 264 billboards; and 120,000 ballots. 
 
¶7.  (U)PRT Maysan funded the Maysan NGO Capacity Building Project, 
whose goal is to promote effectiveness of civil society 
organizations to ensure that citizens' interests are included in the 
provincial government's policy and resource allocations.  The PRT 
funded training and outreach to increase the institutional capacity 
and viability of 10 local NGOs. 
 
------------------ 
WORKING WITH WOMEN 
------------------ 
¶8.  (U) PRT Muthana assisted the Al Rafidain Women's Organization 
and their NGO network to hold 147 voter education events attended by 
6,889 people, including 3,168 women. 
 
¶9.  (U) In the heart of the former Sunni insurgency, ePRT Fallujah 
Q9.  (U) In the heart of the former Sunni insurgency, ePRT Fallujah 
recently funded a 3-month long leadership development class for 50 
young Fallujah women.  These women will receive lectures and 
participate in discussions on leadership, public speaking and 
women's rights. 
 
---------------- 
EDUCATING VOTERS 
---------------- 
¶10.  (U) PRT Muthana helped facilitate an NGO's production of 15 
"skits" promoting different voter education topics.  Professional 
Iraqi actors performed the skits which were broadcast 60 times 
during the two weeks prior to the January 31 elections. 
 
BAGHDAD 00000389  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
¶11.  One of the Baghdad ePRTs funded trainers who held at least 60 
voter outreach sessions for over 4,500 potential voters.  Of 
particular note, one session in the Al Rasheed district (previously 
known as the Triangle of Death) drew over 550 women on 36 hours 
notice.  Another targeted specifically at women drew an overflow 
crowd of more than 200. 
 
-------------------------------- 
INITIATING POLITICAL INTERACTION 
-------------------------------- 
 
12  (U) PRTs also help break down old, unproductive patterns of 
interaction.  The teams in Salah ah Din, Maysan and elsewhere have 
facilitated and organized visits by the Provincial Governor and 
other central government officials to remote districts and sub 
districts.  Frequently, this was the first face-to-face interaction 
between the officials and their electorate.
