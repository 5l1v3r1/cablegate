SUBJECT: IRAN: TURKMEN SCHOLAR SEES CHANGES IN IRAN 
 
Classified By: Charge Richard Miles, reasons 1.4(b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C)  A prominent Persian language scholar with close ties 
to Iranian academics told Iran Watcher this week that he 
fears that vote-rigging, similar to what was alleged to have 
occurred in the 2005 Iranian Presidential elections, will 
determine the outcome of Iran's Presidential election in 
June.  XXXXXXXXXXXX (please protect strictly 
throughout), a retired professor at XXXXXXXXXXXX
who now teaches XXXXXXXXXXXX in Ashgabat, said that he believes former President Khatami would win the popular vote "hands down," but fears the results could be altered to favor the conservatives in 
the election. 
 
¶2. (C) XXXXXXXXXXXX attended an international conference of 
Persian language scholars in Teheran last month said that the 
Iranians he met with are "tired" and "fed up" with their 
country's isolation and want a dialog with the United States 
and the West.  He said that having previously visited Iran 
five years ago, the changes in the country were striking. 
Whereas on his earlier visit photos of Khomeini were still 
pretty much ubiquitous, he said he saw very few this time. 
He said that both in Teheran and at the university XXXXXXXXXXXX the atmosphere was palpably more relaxed 
than it had felt anytime since the 1979 revolution.  He 
noticed "a lot more hair showing" (and make-up) on the female 
students, and was surprised to see young couples hugging or 
walking hand-in-hand on campus.  He also observed a huge 
increase in prices, noting that a kilo of meat now costs ten 
dollars in Teheran. 
 
¶3. (C)  NOTE AND COMMENT: XXXXXXXXXXXX formerly taught XXXXXXXXXXXX . 
He served as XXXXXXXXXXXX interpreter during 
his official visits to Iran, as well visits of former 
President Rafsanjani to Ashgabat in the 1990s.  Now retired, 
he teaches translation courses XXXXXXXXXXXX
in Ashgabat.  Although he did not provide details in his 
conversation with Iran Watcher, he has apparently come under 
pressure from the Turkmen Government recently, which was 
partially the reason for his departure from the university 
faculty.  XXXXXXXXXXXX was clearly uncomfortable speaking at 
length in public even in Farsi.  He has many contacts both in 
Iran and with the Iranian community in Turkmenistan and 
offered to be in touch with Iran Watcher to facilitate 
contacts with them. END COMMENT.
