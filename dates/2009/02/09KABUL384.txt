STATISTICS; JANUARY 1 - FEBRUARY 19 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary. This cable is the first in a monthly series 
recording significant counternarcotics activity in Afghanistan. 
Highlights include: 
 
- The Afghan police, protected by an Afghan Army battalion, launched 
successful eradication operations in Helmand Province starting 
January 31. Over 1500 hectares (3750 acres) of poppy have been 
eradicated so far, despite frequent hostile contact. 
 
- ISAF supported its first purely counter-narcotics lab-busting 
operation on February 9, with participation by U.S. and Norwegian 
military forces. 
 
- The Afghan government arrested 10 low and mid-level narcotics 
traffickers and seized 7,967 kg of opium and 363 kg of heroin. 
 
End Summary. 
 
ERADICATION AND RAIDS 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Helmand Operation: The Afghan National Police's Poppy 
Eradication Force (PEF), force-protected by an Afghan National Army 
battalion (CNIK), commenced operations in Nad-e Ali district of 
Helmand province on January 31.  As of February 18, PEF had 
eradicated over 1500 hectares (final numbers may vary with 
verification), already surpassing the 1,174 hectares PEF eradicated 
last season, when it lacked the benefit of CNIK force protection. 
Organized insurgent resistance has left two CNIK dead, seven CNIK 
wounded, two ANP wounded, and damaged two INL helicopters. 
 
¶3. (SBU) DEA/NIU Hit Labs:  A joint DEA/Afghan National Interdiction 
Unit (NIU) force executed a search warrant in Achin District, 
Nangarhar province on February 18, and seized 600 kgs of opium. 
This is a continuing case involving suspected narcotics trafficker 
Haji Baghcho. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) A DEA/NIU unit also destroyed 10 narcotics labs in 
Nangarhar on February 9 with security support provided by a 
Norwegian Special Forces unit that cleared the areas of Afghan 
civilians.  ISAF aircraft, at the request of the Afghan government, 
bombed a separate heroin lab. This was the first time ISAF military 
aircraft supported an explicitly CN interdiction operation.

SIGNIFICANT CN CASES 
-------------------- 
 
¶11. (SBU) Haji Khostel.  In September of 2008 the British Serious 
Organized Crime Agency (SOCA) began surveilling Haji Khostel and 
others with whom he was involved in the illegal drug business.  SOCA 
reports Khostel owns a heroin processing facility in Bakwa district 
of Farah Province. He buys opium and chemical precursors, processes

this into heroin and sells it in Nimroz, Farah and Herat provinces, 
and also transports it to Iran and Pakistan. 
 
¶12. (SBU) Said Mohammed, an associate of Khostel, was arrested in 
Nimroz with about 168 kg of Khostel's heroin.   Khostel was charged 
and detained.  In January prosecutors finished work on Khostel's 
case and transferred the case to the primary court prosecutors for 
trial. A trial date has yet to be set 
 
¶13. (SBU) Sayeed Silab.  Sayeed Silab was, until his arrest on 
January 19, the CNPA chief in Nimroz Province.  SOCA linked Siab to 
Haji Ghulam, a drug business partner of Haji Khoste 
l (see above).  Silab was paid about USD $300,000 to blame an 
innocent person for possessing approximately 160 kgs of Khostel's 
drugs that Said Mohammed, another of Khostel's drug confederation, 
possessed. Silab was arrested on orders of Ministry of Interior 
Deputy Minister for Counternarcotics, Gen. Daoud.  The Solab case is 
with the investigative prosecutors at CJTF as of January 24.  The 
Khostel and Silab cases are significant because they involve both a 
large scale drug dealer and a provincial CNPA chief. 
 
¶15. (SBU) Isamel Safid.  Ismael Safid was originally charged at the 
CJTF in 2005 for possessing about 157 kgs of heroin.  Safid was 
released pending his appeal.  Safid failed to appear at his appeal. 
He was convicted, in absentia, by the CNTF.  (NOTE:  This is 
permitted under Afghan law.)  The appeal court sentenced Safid to 19 
years.  Safid remained a fugitive for almost three years.  In 
December 2008, a CJTF investigator, working closely with DOJ mentors 
and DEA had an informant who helped the Afghan police arrest Safid 
in Kabul.  Safid has appealed his case to the Supreme Court.
