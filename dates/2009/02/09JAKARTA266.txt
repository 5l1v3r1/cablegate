FROM AMBASSADOR CAMERON HUME 
 
¶1. (U) Summary.  President Yudhoyono intends to raise with the 
Secretary on February 19 the World Ocean Conference (WOC) and the 
Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) Summit, both scheduled to take place 
in Indonesia in mid-May.  Neither Indonesia nor the United States is 
now adequately prepared for these meetings.  The WOC will issue a 
declaration on ocean issues that will influence subsequent climate 
change negotiations, and the CTI Summit will launch the first 
significant multilateral program aimed at preserving the world's 
richest marine environment.  This message proposes several steps to 
get USG preparations on track.  End Summary. 
 
------------------------------------ 
May 2009: The World Ocean Conference 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  The World Ocean Conference scheduled for May 11-15, 2009, will 
focus on how oceans influence and are influenced by climate change, 
culminating in the signing of the Manado Ocean Declaration. 
Indonesians are expecting 2,500 participants from over 100 
countries, including government officials, scientists, NGO 
representatives and journalists.  The Manado Ocean Declaration, 
still in preparation, will highlight the role of the ocean in 
regulating climate change and the importance of protecting the ocean 
to mitigate and adapt to climate change.  The Conference and 
Declaration will influence the development of global oceans policy 
and focus attention on ocean-climate change linkages in the lead up 
to Copenhagen.  Indonesian representatives will be discussing the 
draft in Washington on February 19, and Indonesia is hosting a 
second drafting session in Jakarta on February 26-27.  Washington 
needs to send oceans officials for this drafting session. 
 
¶3.  The best way to keep the WOC on a constructive track is through 
active engagement by the United States to shape the final 
Declaration and manage the process, particularly linkages to 
Copenhagen.  This engagement should include the strong presence and 
active participation by our researchers and officials during the 
WOC. 
 
------------------------------ 
The Coral Triangle Initiative 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  The Coral Triangle Initiative (encompassing Indonesia, Malaysia, 
Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Solomon Islands, and Timor-Leste) is 
the epicenter of marine biodiversity on earth.  But it is at risk 
from destructive and illegal fishing practices, poor coastal 
resources management, and climate change. For example, 80% of the 
world's tuna comes from these waters.  The collapse of the tuna 
fishery here would have devastating consequences for Indonesians and 
American consumers alike.  Failure to manage this immense area 
sustainably would have global consequences, especially in the 
context of climate change.  From ocean acidification to loss of 
biodiversity to food and maritime security--whatever the issue--this 
vast area is strategically important. 
¶5.  President Yudhoyono unveiled the CTI at the 2007 Bali Climate 
Change conference to address environmental threats to coastal and 
marine resources.  The United States and Australia participated as 
CTI "inaugurating partners."  President Bush endorsed the CTI 
proposal at the 2007 APEC Summit.  The United States, the largest 
bilateral donor, has already pledged $32 million to the CTI over the 
next five years.  On May 15, the respective leaders will formally 
launch the CTI at a summit immediately following the World Ocean 
Conference.  Five Heads of Government have confirmed their planned 
attendance, with the sixth (Malaysia) not confirming due to pending 
elections.  Australian Prime Minister Rudd plans to participate.  To 
date, the United States, the only other inaugurating partner to the 
CTI, has not identified its representative. 
 
----------------------------------- 
Benefits of a Successful Conference 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Strong USG support of the WOC and CTI would help get this 
vast marine area under sustainable management, advance our climate 
objectives by influencing the Manado Declaration and Conference, and 
demonstrate progress under our bilateral strategic partnership.

Making it Happen: Some Recommendations 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) Twelve weeks remain before the conference begins.  The 
Indonesian government is working to finalize plans for the 
conference but needs support from other governments, including the 
United States.  Although several USG agencies have been involved in 
conference planning, we need a designated senior leader with 
responsibility to galvanize the process.  We recommend the 
following: 
 
-- Designate a high level special envoy, perhaps a former senior 
State official familiar with environmental issues, to lead and 
coordinate interagency efforts, to engage quickly in the region with 
the Indonesians and other parties, to reach out to Americans who 
should be at the summit (in academia, the private sector, and the 
NGO community) and to shape our environmental, scientific and 
climate change messages.  The envoy can chair a new Deputy Assistant 
Secretary-level inter-agency working group on the WOC and CTI, 
including NOAA, CEQ, EPA, NSF, USAID, etc. 
 
-- Commit to sending a cabinet level official to attend the 
conference (or a distinguished American like former Vice President 
Al Gore) and identify other members of the delegation.  Minister of 
Marine Affairs and Fisheries Freddy Numberi has invited NOAA 
Administrator Dr. Jane Lubchenco to participate in the WOC and CTI 
Summit. But additional senior U.S. representation from State and 
USAID is needed. 
 
-- Encourage and solicit Senate and Congressional participation.
