REF: SECSTATE 06970

¶1. (C) PolChief met on February 10 with Outi Holopainen, the 
MFA's Director for Arms Control, Disarmament and 
Non-Proliferation, to discuss the Finnish government's (GOF) 
views on upcoming non-proliferation meetings (REF). 
Holopainen said that, regarding the NPT review cycle, the GOF 
had not formed concrete positions regarding its own 
objectives - that would happen later in February into March; 
she had not seen any documents coming out of EU working 
groups.  Holopainen appreciated early engagement on the 
matter by the U.S., and added that Finland is not alone in 
looking to the new Administration with high expectations, 
hoping for positive signals about the tone to be set for the 
Prepcom (calling early signs "constructive and "very 
promising").  Holopainen attributed the relative slowness of 
Finland (and the EU) to a "wait and see" attitude, i.e., 
waiting for "signals" to indicate whether the "overall 
atmosphere will be conducive for progress" at the May 2009 
PrepCom. 
 
¶2. (C) Holopainen shared current thinking within the GOF on 
the NPT.  She stressed the importance of the "credibility" 
and "universality" of the NPT, adding that a key issue for 
the GOF is a balance of the treaty's "three pillars" of 
non-proliferation, disarmament and nuclear cooperation.  She 
noted an "eternal tension" regarding the pillars, in 
particular between the nuclear "haves" and "have nots." 
Holopainen said that as a small have-not Finland would 
benefit from a strong, fully implemented NPT.  For Finland, 
one area seemingly forgotten in NPT discussions is that of 
tactical nuclear weapons. Sharing such a long border with 
Russia, tactical nuclear weapons remain an important topic 
that the Finns feel has been neglected. 
 
¶3. (C) Regarding what the GOF looks for from the new 
Administration, Holopainen said they would like to see the 
U.S. ratify the CTBT.  The GOF realizes the Administration 
faces difficulties domestically, but feels that ratification 
would provide a valuable example for others to follow. 
 
¶4. (C) Holopainen touched on a few other matters.  EU member 
states are discussing the proliferation of technology and a 
multilateral arrangement regarding a nuclear fuel supply. 
Holopainen, pointing to the concern of some countries that 
such and arrangement constitutes an attempt by the West to 
monopolize the nuclear fuel market, said that such an 
arrangement is "easier said than done."  Nevertheless, 
Finland is willing to work constructively on the matter, in 
particular within the EU. 
 
¶5. (S) COMMENT: On non-proliferation activities the Finns 
have been very cooperative.  They have assured us that the 
GOF vigorously implements dual use provisions of UNSCR 1803 
on Iran's nuclear program and all previous resolutions 
related to Iran.  The government has established a working 
group that includes the Foreign Ministry, Customs and the 
Ministry of Employment and the Economy in order to provide 
additional safeguards. Officials state that the GOF welcomes 
the EU's process aimed at ensuring implementation among all 
Member States. On sanctions, the GOF has been supportive of 
possible sanctions against Iran within an EU framework. Last 
summer the GOF prevented a pending transaction that would 
have put dual-use weather-related technology in the hands of 
an Iranian shell company.  END COMMENT.
