1.(C) MFA Assistant Minister for American Affairs Shadia Farraq raised Minister of Culture Farouk Hosny's UNESCO candidacy with the Ambassador February 5. Speaking on behalf of FM Aboul Gheit, Farrag said that the Egyptians continued to place the highest priority on this issue.

2.(C) The Ambassador noted that the issue has not yet been reviewed by the new administration, but she believed that the problems surrounding Hosny's candidacy would persist for the new administration and Congress. She said that the U.S. is looking for a candidate with management experience who is a consensus-builder, not a source of controversy. There is no personal animus toward Minister Hosny, but his long history of troubling comments creates an ongoing difficulty.

3.(C) The Ambassador urged Egypt to change its course and come up with a new candidate, or alternatively support an Arab candidate from outside Egypt, and questioned the wisdom of presenting the new administration with such a difficult and sensitive matter. Farrag responded that she did not believe the GOE would be able to pull back its support for Hosny now, and argued that Hosny would be capable of rising above his shortcomings and secure the UNESCO nomination. The Ambassador promised to convey the GOE position to Washington. SCOBEY
