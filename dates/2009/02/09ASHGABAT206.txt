¶1.  (U) Sensitive but Unclassified.  Not for public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Fifty Turkish firms and companies displayed 
technology, equipment, expertise and construction products at an 
exhibition held in Ashgabat from February 5-7.  The exhibition 
received the usual amount of attention from senior Government 
officials who attended the opening ceremony and later walked the 
aisles looking at all of the wares.  The exposition underscored the 
tight relationship that some Turkish companies continue to enjoy 
with the Turkmen Government.  All indications point to a happy and 
long-lived partnership in which Turkish companies give the Turkmen 
Government what it wants, and the Government is happy with final 
results.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (U)  Last week, Ashgabat hosted the "Expo Build 2009" exhibition 
of construction materials and decorative items from Turkey.  The 
Meridyen International Exhibition Company and the Chamber of 
Commerce and Industry of Turkmenistan organized the specialized 
exhibition, where companies and firms from different regions of 
Turkey marketed their construction materials, expertise, the latest 
construction and educational technologies and other innovations. 
Members of the Turkmen Government, Parliament and public 
associations, as well as the diplomatic corps attended the opening 
ceremony.  Chamber of Commerce and Industry Chairman Taganov 
delivered an opening speech in which he stressed the role of 
bilateral cooperation in construction and industry.  Afterward, 
senior Turkmen officials from a variety of ministries were seen 
checking out the exhibits. 
 
¶4.  (U)  Mr. Tucer Kayalar, the head of the Turkish delegation and 
Chief of Turkey's Foreign Trade Department, spoke next, highlighting 
the deepening ties between Turkmenistan and Turkey and the 
importance of the growing construction business in the region. 
Nearly 50 Turkish companies were represented, marketing a range of 
construction technologies and equipment, building materials and 
tools, electric lighting and decorative elements.  In particular, 
companies displayed marble products, electrical appliances, plumbing 
materials, paints, wrought iron, gypsum, foam products, concrete 
materials and related equipment, chemicals, and heating and water 
systems. 
 
¶5.  (U)  The exposition illustrated the depth and breadth of current 
Turkmen-Turkish cooperation in construction here.  In recent years, 
Turkmenistan has become engulfed in construction projects, and the 
work is in full swing day and night.  Hundreds of new buildings and 
facilities of every type are being built in the capital and 
throughout Turkmenistan at a breakneck pace.  Large-scale 
construction projects such as the Avaza National Tourist Zone 
project, which seeks to create a world-class seaside resort on the 
Caspian Sea coast, are being realized primarily with the help of 
Turkish partners such as Polimeks, Gap Insaat and Sehil Insaat. 
Turkish companies have been dominant for the last decade in 
Turkmenistan.  From 2003-2008, according to Turkmen press reporting, 
Turkish contractors won construction contracts worth $8.2 billion 
from the Turkmen Government. 
¶6.  (SBU)  COMMENT:  Turkish companies have shown keen interest in 
strengthening long-term business contacts with Turkmenistan, and 
appear to view it as an exceptionally valued partner for 
construction work.  Turkish companies have also figured out what the 
Turkmen Government likes, and go out of their way to give the 
Government more of what it wants.  The Turkmen Government, for its 
part, appears to value the relationship with Turkish companies as 
well, and seems to be pleased overall with what the companies are 
delivering.  END COMMENT.
