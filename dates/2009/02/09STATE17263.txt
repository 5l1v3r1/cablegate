SUBJECT: MULTILATERAL AEGEAN EXERCISE EGEMEN

REF: A. ATHENS-EMB. ANKARA-EUR/SE EMAILS. (2/6)

     ¶C. ATHENS 240

Classified By: EUR: DEPUTY ASSISTANT SECRETARY MATTHEW BRYZA

¶1. (C) THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST.  PLEASE SEE PARAGRAPH 8.

¶2. (C) SUMMARY AND BACKGROUND: FROM MARCH 13-30, A TURKEY-UK
PLANNED MULTILATERAL EXERCISE, EGEMEN ("SOVEREIGN") IS
SCHEDULED TO TAKE PLACE IN THE AEGEAN.  THE U.S. IS SCHEDULED
TO PARTICIPATE (ONE SHIP, USS MITSCHER) ALONG WITH THE
NETHERLANDS AND BELGIUM.  THE USS MITSCHER WILL BE UNDER
TACTICAL CONTROL (TACON) OF THE UK.

¶3. (C) ON FEBRUARY 6, 2009 THE GOVERNMENT OF GREECE (GOG)
RAISED SEVERAL CONCERNS ABOUT THE EXERCISE WITH EMBASSY
ATHENS (REF A). THESE CONCERNS INCLUDED:

(A) MAPS TURKEY INAPPROPRIATELY DISTRIBUTED VIA THE NATO
"CRONOS" SYSTEM THAT DEPICT DEMILITARIZED ISLANDS AND SEARCH
AND RESCUE RESPONSIBILITIES, BOTH OF WHICH GREECE DISPUTES,

(B) PLANNED AREAS OF OPERATION FOR THE EXERCISE THAT CLEARLY
FALL WITHIN GREEK SOVEREIGN TERRITORY,

(C) A SEARCH AND RESCUE (SAR) COMPONENT OF THE EXERCISE THAT
DOES NOT INCLUDE COORDINATION WITH ATHENS' FLIGHT INFORMATION
REGION (FIR), AND

(D) CONCERN THAT THE OPERATIONAL PLAN FOR THE EXERCISE
INCLUDES TRANSIT OF GREEK TERRITORIAL WATERS, ACCEPTABLE FOR
COMMERCIAL AND CIVILIAN TRANSIT, BUT WHICH IS NOT ACCEPTABLE
FOR MILITARY VESSELS WITHOUT SPECIFIC GREEK PERMISSION, WHICH
HAS NOT BEEN REQUESTED.

¶4. (C) THE USG BELIEVES THAT TWO OF THESE FOUR CONCERNS (B
AND D) ARE CLEARLY LEGITIMATE AND NEED TO BE ADDRESSED PRIOR
TO THE START OF THE EXERCISE.  IF THEY ARE NOT CORRECTED,
THEY COULD INFRINGE UPON GREECE'S SOVEREIGN TERRITORY IN
CONTRAVENTION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.  AS CO-PLANNERS OF THE
EXERCISE, THE USG BELIEVES THAT THE UK AND TURKEY SHOULD HAVE
THE LEAD IN RESOLVING THESE CONCERNS.  (NOTE: WE UNDERSTAND
THAT THE UK MAY BELIEVE THAT IT IS TURKEY'S RESPONSIBILITY TO
RESOLVE THE GREEK CONCERNS AS IT WAS TURKEY'S MAPS,
INAPROPRIATELY SENT OVER THE NATO SYSTEM, WHICH GREECE
DISPUTES AND WHICH ORIGINALLY RAISED GOG CONCERNS. END NOTE)

¶5. (C) TWO OF GREECE'S CONCERNS, IN THE U.S. VIEW, SHOULD NOT
INTERFERE WITH MOVING FORWARD ON THE EXERCISE.  FIRST, THE
USG DOES NOT VIEW TURKEY'S DISTRIBUTION OF MAPS ON THE NATO
"CRONOS" SYSTEM AS LEGITIMIZING TURKISH (OR GREEK) CLAIMS IN
THE AEGEAN.  SECOND, WITH REGARD TO CONCERNS OVER THE SAR
COMPONENT OF THE EXERCISE TAKING PLACE WITHIN ATHENS' FIR,
THE 1994 ICAO CONVENTION DOES NOT REQUIRE STATE AIRCRAFT TO
FILE FLIGHT PLANS WITHIN THE FIR, ALTHOUGH THEY ARE REQUIRED
TO FLY "WITH DUE REGARD TO SAFETY."  WHILE THE FIR IS
TYPICALLY USED AS A BASIS FOR SAR REGIONS, THIS IS NOT
NECESSARILY REQUIRED.  IN THIS CASE, WHILE IT RECOGNIZES
GREECES' FIR, TURKEY HAS NOT RECOGNIZED GREECE'S SAR REGION.
THEREFORE, THERE IS NO INTERNATIONALLY RECOGNIZED MARITIME
SAR REGION IN MUCH OF THIS AREA.  THE USG HAS NOT PREVIOUSLY
WEIGHED IN ON THIS LONGSTANDING AEGEAN DISPUTE.  WE BELIEVE
IT IS NOT IN THE USG'S INTEREST TO DO SO NOW.  EVERY EFFORT
SHOULD BE TAKEN BY TURKEY AND THE UK TO ENSURE THE SAR
COMPONENT OF THE EXERCISE TAKES PLACE IN INTERNATIONAL WATERS
OR TURKISH TERRITORIAL WATERS.

¶6. (SBU) THE U.S. BELIEVES THE TWO LEGITIMATE CONCERNS RAISED
BY THE GOG CAN EASILY BE RESOLVED.  THE U.S. IS CONTINUING
WITH PLANS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE EXERCISE UNDER UK TACON,
PENDING RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES IN ACCORDANCE WITH
INTERNATIONAL LAW AND PRACTICE.  THE GOG HAS INDICATED TO THE
U.S. THAT IT CAN ACCEPT THE EXERCISE AS LONG AS ITS CONCERNS
ARE MET (REF. C) THE U.S.  BELIEVES THAT PULLING OUT OF THE
EXERCISE AT THIS LATE DATE WOULD LIKELY INCREASE AEGEAN
TENSIONS AND THEREFORE, THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION IS TO HAVE
THE UK TAKE THE LEAD WITH THE TURKS IN RESOLVING THE TWO KEY
ISSUES.

¶7. (C) OBJECTIVE: EMBASSIES SHOULD NOTE U.S. SUPPORT FOR
GOING FORWARD WITH THE EXERCISE IN A WAY THAT ADDRESSES THE
TWO LEGITIMATE CONCERNS RAISED BY GREECE.  SPECIFICALLY, THE
U.S. BELIEVES THAT THE UK AND TURKEY, AS CO-PLANNERS, SHOULD
AMEND THE EXERCISE AS NECESSARY TO AVOID INFRINGEMENT OF
GREECE'S SOVEREIGN TERRITORY (SPECIFICALLY, CHANGING THE
EXERCISE AREA SUCH THAT IT DOES NOT CROSS INTERNATIONALLY
RECOGNIZED SOVEREIGN GREEK TERRITORY), AND ENSURE THE SAR
PORTION OF THE EXERCISE TAKES PLACE IN INTERNATIONAL OR
TURKISH WATERS.

¶8. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: DEPARTMENT REQUESTS EMBASSY LONDON
RAISE THE EGEMEN EXERCISE WITH APPROPRIATE UK OFFICIALS TO
URGE THAT THE UK, AS CO-PLANNER, GOES FORWARD WITH THE
EXERCISE IN A WAY THAT ADDRESSES THE TWO LEGITIMATE CONCERNS
RAISED BY GREECE.  EMBASSIES ANKARA AND ATHENS SHOULD DRAW
UPON THE BELOW POINTS IN DISCUSSIONS WITH HOST GOVERNMENT AND
UK OFFICIALS AS APPROPRIATE.

FOR USE WITH HMG OFFICIALS ONLY:

-THE U.S. IS PLEASED TO PARTNER IN THE MULTILATERAL EXERCISE
EGEMENT WITH THE UK (UNDER UK TACON) AND TURKEY AS CO-HOSTS
OF THE EXERCISE AND OUR OTHER ALLIES INVOLOVED.

-THOUGH THE GOG HAS RAISED CONCERNS WITH US REGARDING THIS
EXERCISE, WE HAVE ENCOURAGED THE GOG TO WORK THROUGH THE UK
AND TURKEY DIRECTLY, AS CO-PLANNERS OF THE EXERCISE TO
RESOLVE GREECE'S LEGITIMATE CONCERNS.

-THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH OUR DESIRE THAT GREECE AND TURKEY
CONSULT DIRECTLY TO RESOLVE AEGEAN DIFFERENCES.

-OUR PREFERENCE IS FOR THE UK AND TURKEY TO GO FORWARD WITH
THE EXERCISE IN A WAY THAT ADDRESSES TWO OF THE CONCERNS THE
GREEKS HAVE RAISED THAT WE BELIEVE NEED TO BE ADDRESSED.  WE
ALSO BELIEVE THAT CANCELLING THE EXERCISE AT THIS LATE DATE
WOULD LIKELY INCREASE AEGEAN TENSIONS.

-SPECIFICALLY, THE U.S. URGES THE UK TO SEEK WAYS TO RESOLVE
THE CONCERNS REGARDING AREAS OF OPERATION CLEARLY WITHIN
GREEK SOVEREIGN TERRITORY AND TRANSIT OF GREEK TERRITORIAL
WATERS BY VESSELS PARTICIPATING IN A MILITARY EXERCISE.  BOTH
OF THESE COULD POSSIBLY INFRINGE ON GREECE'S SOVEREIGN
TERRITORY, IN CONTRAVENTION OF INTERNATIONAL LAW.

-WITH REGARD TO GREECE'S OTHER CONCERNS, THE U.S. BELIEVES
THE REVISED EXERCISE SHOULD TAKE CARE TO ENSURE THAT ALL
PORTIONS OF THE EXERCISE (ESPECIALLY THE SAR PORTION) TAKE
PLACE IN TURKISH TERRITORIAL WATERS OR IN INTERNATIONAL
WATERS TO ENSURE IT DOES NOT INFRINGE IN ANY WAY ON GREEK
SOVEREIGN TERRITORY.

FOR EMBASSIES LONDON, ATHENS AND ANKARA TO USE WITH HOST
COUNTRY AND UK OFFICIALS AS APPROPRIATE:

-THE USG PARTICIPATES IN MULTILATERAL EXERCISES WORLDWIDE,
WITH OUR PARTNERS AND ALLIES.

-AT THE INVITATION OF TURKEY AND THE UK, THE USG PLANS TO
PARTICIPATE IN THE MULTILATERAL EXERCISE EGEMEN, WITH ONE
SHIP UNDER THE TACTICAL CONTROL OF THE UK COMMANDER.

-GREEK CONCERNS REGARDING THE EGEMEN SHOULD BE RAISED
DIRECTLY WITH THE UK AND TURKEY AS CO-PLANNERS OF THE
EXERCISE.

-THE USG RESPECTS GREECE'S AND TURKEY'S SOVEREIGN TERRITORY,
BUT ALSO REITERATES THE NEED TO RE-ENERGIZE BILATERAL
DISCUSSIONS TO RESOLVE OUTSTANDING DISPUTES IN THE AEGEAN.

-THE USG DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE MAPS DISTRIBUTED VIA THE NATO
CRONOS SYSTEM AS LEGITIMIZING ANY AEGEAN LITTORAL STATE'S
INTERPRETATION OF EITHER DEMILITARIZED ISLANDS OR SEARCH AND
RESCUE RESPONSIBILITIES.
