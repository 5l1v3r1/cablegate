Message from Acting Assistant Secretary Ambassador Jeffrey 
Feltman to Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker: 
 
Ryan, on behalf of all of your friends and admirers in your 
NEA family, I want to thank you personally for your efforts, 
and your remarkable accomplishments, in Iraq.  Under your 
leadership the Embassy and other elements of the U.S. Mission 
have made an extraordinary contribution to the great success 
of Iraq towards achieving stability and reconciliation.  The 
fact that over seven million Iraqis were able to safely vote 
in free and fair elections for their provincial council 
representatives last month underscored just how far Iraq has 
come. 
 
Because of your tireless efforts, the change in the U.S. 
approach to Iraq which coincided with your arrival in Baghdad 
has largely accomplished its goals.  Your skill and 
persistence are the reason the U.S. and Iraq signed historic 
Strategic Framework and Security Agreements that establish a 
strategic partnership of momentous importance to our two 
countries, and to the region as a whole.  These successes 
could not have been achieved without your expertise, 
diplomatic skills, leadership and ) perhaps most of all -- 
your tenacity. 
 
All of us in the Department will miss your counsel and 
camaraderie as you move on to a very well-deserved 
retirement.  You leave a legendary career.  We in NEA are 
very proud to have been able to have one of the Department's 
best as one of our own.  Again, thank you for your 
extraordinary service to the State Department, and to your 
country. 
CLINTON
