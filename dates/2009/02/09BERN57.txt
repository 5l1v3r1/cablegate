NON-HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO NICARAGUA FOLLOWING 
FRAUDULENT ELECTIONS 
 
REF: A. A. SECSTATE 132044 
     ¶B. B. BERN 00655 
 
¶1. (SBU) Further to reftel A request for Switzerland to 
freeze non-humanitarian assistance to Nicaragua following its 
fraudulent municipal elections of November 9, and reftel B 
interim response, Nora Kronig, Regional Coordinator for 
Central and South America at the Swiss Federal Department of 
Foreign Affairs (EDA), called Poloff on 28 January 2009 to 
provide the following input from her Swiss contacts concerned 
with this issue.  Kronig said that EDA took note of the USG 
position and was interested to know where the U.S. stood in 
this regard.  The GOS is, according to Kronig, aware of the 
risks associated with the Nicaraguan situation and is 
following the developments with great attention.  Further, 
Swiss interlocutors are discussing the municipal elections 
and their consequences within the Donors Group of Nicaragua. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Kronig added that Switzerland has expressed concern 
with the elections by way of a press communique and has also 
done so bilaterally with the GON.  Given the exclusion of two 
political parties in this election, Switzerland has addressed 
its concern at the Minister of Foreign Affairs level between 
the GOS and GON. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Budget Support Group, which Kronig explained 
gives financial assistance to the Nicaraguan government to 
implement programs, differs from the development/humanitarian 
aid provided by Switzerland through the Swiss Agency for 
Development and Cooperation (SDC).  Kronig stated that the 
Budget Support Group met in mid-January to assess the 
situation and discuss the continuation of providing 
assistance to Nicaragua, adding that the group decided that 
Nicaragua's actions will "bear consequences," and a 
suspension of budget support will not be excluded as a 
possibility.  The GOS has, at this time, decided that 
programs and projects that have been supported by Switzerland 
for a long time will be maintained, but under increased 
vigilance. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Kronig closed by explaining that Switzerland has 
always acted as a constructive partner and an honest broker 
in its relations with Nicaragua, and that the GOS will 
continue to opt for open and constructive dialogue.  That 
said, she noted that Switzerland will voice critical views 
and encourage democracy, non-violence, human rights, and the 
rule of law, and will seek constructive solutions where 
problems arise.
