¶2.  Aftermath of Israeli Elections 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
The Jerusalem Post quoted senior GOI officials as saying that PM 
Ehud OlmertQs decision to condition a Gaza cease-fire and the 
opening of the border crossings on the release of Gilad Shalit comes 
amid a growing sense in Jerusalem that Hamas is not QseriousQ about 
releasing Shalit and would be happy if the current situation 
continued Qindefinitely.Q  Maariv quoted senior Israeli defense 
sources as saying, among mutual recriminations between the 
entourages of Olmert and DM Ehud Barak, that the deal is not moving 
forward.  Leading media cited Egyptian mediatorsQ anger over 
IsraelQs linkage of the two issues. 
 
The media quoted President Shimon Peres as saying that until he 
received the official results of TuesdayQs elections, he is 
Qhesitant to even discuss with myself the subjectQ of assigning one 
of the political leaders the responsibility of forming a government. 
 All media reported that yesterday Kadima agreed to all of Yisrael 
BeiteinuQs demands but one, including toppling Hamas, changing the 
electoral system, funding immigrants, reforming conversions, and 
recognizing civil unions between men and women.  The only demand 
Kadima did not accept was initiating a loyalty oath to the state. 
HaQaretz reported that Yisrael Beiteinu Chairman Avigdor Lieberman 
and Kadima chief Tzipi Livni are working to form a "civil front" to 
counter the right-wing and ultra-Orthodox parties which Likud has 
been wooing in the coalition talks.  HaQaretz quoted sources in 
Kadima and Likud as saying they don't expect Lieberman to recommend 
any candidate to President Shimon Peres on Thursday as Yisrael 
Beiteinu's choice to form a new government. Lieberman would instead 
try to force the formation of a national unity government consisting 
of Kadima, Likud and Yisrael Beiteinu, without the ultra-Orthodox 
Sephardi party Shas.  Makor Rishon-Hatzofe reported that Likud 
Chairman Benjamin Netanyahu prefers a broad-based government. 
 
Citing the AP, HaQaretz quoted visiting U.S. Senator Benjamin Cardin 
(D-MD) as saying yesterday that there is little difference between 
the policies of President Obama and his predecessor over Iran -- 
both want to keep Iran from getting nuclear weapons.  Also citing 
the AP, HaQaretz reported that Senator John Kerry is challenging 
Syria to demonstrate its seriousness about encouraging peace and 
stability in the Middle East.  Kerry will meet with Syria's 
president this week on a tour of the region that began yesterday in 
Egypt.  The senator said the U.S. is eager to talk to Syria, whose 
president said last month he also wants a dialogue with Washington, 
but without preconditions. 
 
Leading media quoted Hizbullah leader Hassan Nasrallah as saying 
yesterday that his group has the right to possess an air defense 
system to counter the Israeli war planes that regularly fly over 
Lebanon.  Israel Radio quoted Nasrallah as saying that Hizbullah has 
acquired anti-aircraft weapons. 
 
Yesterday HaQaretz reported that some 1,700 dunams (approximately 
425 acres) of land in the northern part of Efrat were declared state 
land last week, paving the way for the West Bank settlement to start 
the process of seeking government approval to build there.  The 
Civil Administration issued the declaration after rejecting eight 
appeals by Palestinians against the move. 
 
HaQaretz reported that yesterday FM Tzipi Livni called on the U.S. 
to not participate in the QDurban 2Q conference to be held in Geneva 
in April.  The Jerusalem Post reported that yesterday senior White 
House and State Department officials held a conference call with 
American Jewish leaders to reassure them over the administrationQs 
decision to participate in preliminary discussions about the 
conference. 
 
Maariv cited the belief of senior Israeli defense sources that U.S. 
special envoy George Mitchell will recommend that the U.S. apply 
economic sanctions against Israel by curtailing American aid so that 
it relinquishes the settlements. 
 
The Jerusalem Post quoted Bill Knapp, NetanyahuQs American adviser 
who served as a strategist in President ObamaQs election campaign, 
as saying that Netanyahu and Obama would enjoy a good working 
relationship.  The newspaper also reported that Netanyahu is not 
ruling out participation in a Mideast conference in Moscow.  The 
Jerusalem Post also quoted Netanyahu as saying on Monday that he 
wants to strengthen moderate Palestinian forces. 
Leading media reported that yesterday the IDF bombed three smuggling 
tunnels along the Gaza-Egypt border, in response to Qassam rocket 
attacks earlier in the day. 
 
Citing the German press agency DPA, HaQaretz quoted Palestinian 
President Mahmoud Abbas as saying yesterday: QUnless settlements are 
brought to a halt, then talks [with Israel] will be meaningless and 
useless. 
 
The Jerusalem Post and other media reported that the IDF announced 
on Monday that it plans to partially re-open Zion Route in Hebron to 
Palestinian vehicles. 
 
Yediot reported that for the first time since a peace treaty was 
signed with Jordan, that country is suing senior Israelis at the 
International Court of Justice over war crimes -Q among them PM 
Olmert, FM Livni, DM Ehud Barak, IDF Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Gabi 
Ashkenazi, Deputy DN Matan Vilnai, and Internal Security Minister 
Avi Dichter.  Speaking on Israel Radio today, Dichter noted that the 
Israeli military was considerate and that official Jordan, which 
repressed a Palestinian revolt in 1970, was not likely to back the 
claim. 
 
HaQaretz reported that a team trained to remove and destroy 
unexploded ordnance has been operating in Gaza for three weeks, but 
its work is being held up because Israel has not approved the entry 
of its equipment nor an area for storing and neutralizing ordnance. 
 
Makor Rishon-Hatzofe reported that British police have arrested 
three British citizens suspected of planning a terrorist attack in 
Israel. 
 
Maariv reported that the Jewish community in Greece is angry over 
the attitude of Israeli-Arab Ambassador to Greece Ali Yihia 
regarding his reported lack of support for IsraelQs operation in 
Gaza and its aftermath.  The daily cited the Foreign MinistryQs 
satisfaction with YihiaQs performance. 
 
Yesterday The Jerusalem Post reported that senior defense officials 
told the newspaper on Sunday that an American refusal to permit the 
installation of Israeli-made defense systems in the Joint Strike 
Fighter (JSF) may postpone the planned delivery of the 
fifth-generation stealth jet beyond the target date of 2014. 
 
Yesterday HaQaretz reported that Abdel Wahid al-Nur, the leader of 
the Sudan Liberation Movement, one of the rebel groups in Sudan's 
Darfur region, recently visited Israel to discuss with a senior 
Israeli official the situation in Sudan.   Al-Nur came to Israel 
earlier this month on his own initiative to attend the annual 
Herzliya Conference 
 
HaQaretz reported that yesterday a Tel Aviv-based female chemist was 
arrested on suspicion of selling dangerous substances to 
Palestinians and criminals. 
 
HaQaretz quoted former Meretz leader Yossi Beilin as saying in his 
new book in Russian that Muhammad Dahlan, who was a member of the 
Palestinian delegation at Camp David in 2000, called former Shas 
leader Aryeh Deri and Avigdor Lieberman a Qkey to peace.Q  Over the 
weekend major media cited LiebermanQs desire to become defense 
minister.  Yediot reported that a group of Jewish university 
professors headed by Dennis Gaitsgory, who teaches mathematics at 
Harvard, has issued a petition warning that elations between Israel 
and U.S. Jews might be seriously harmed if Lieberman gets a key 
ministerial position. 
 
The media reported that Attorney General Menachem Mazuz has decided 
not to investigate Finance Minister Roni Bar-On over an alleged case 
of double voting in the Knesset in 2003. 
 
Yediot reported that an urban  project in the city of Acre (Akko) 
might remove the city from the list of UNESCOQs World Heritage 
sites. 
 
HaQaretz and The Jerusalem Post reported that former British PM Tony 
Blair will be one of the three laureates of the prestigious Dan 
David Prize for 2009, awarded annually by Tel Aviv University. 
 
The Jerusalem Post cited a Market Watch survey that found that 65% 
of Israelis would like Kadima and Likud to form a unity government 
-- 47% thought that Netanyahu should form the next government, while 
39% thought that Livni should.

¶1.  Mideast: 
------------ 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: 
QDisseminators of news should have learned better than to take 
Palestinian death-toll claims at face value, least of all when 
sourced directly or indirectly from the Hamas-run government of 
Gaza.

¶I.  "The First Casualty" 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized (2/17): 
QPalestinian propaganda is insidious because those being manipulated 
are oblivious to what is happening.  Chaotic images of casualties 
being hurried to hospitals, gut-wrenching funerals and swaths of 
shattered buildings create an overarching Qreality.Q  Against this, 
Israel's pleadings that the Palestinians are culpable for the 
destruction, and that the above images lack context, scarcely 
resonate.  Despite six decades of intransigence and a virtual 
copyright on airline hijackings and suicide bombings, the 
Palestinians have created a popular QbrandQ for themselves by 
parlaying their self-inflicted victimization into a battering ram 
against Israel.  Disseminators of news should have learned better 
than to take Palestinian death-toll claims at face value, least of 
all when sourced directly or indirectly from the Hamas-run 
government of Gaza. 
 
 
 
----------------------------------- 
¶2.  Aftermath of Israeli Elections: 
----------------------------------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized: Q[Avigdor 
Lieberman] serving in any ministry, due to the depth and scope of 
the investigation, is highly unreasonable and inappropriate, and it 
is doubtful whether it will pass legal muster. 
 
Leading industrialist Moshe Gaon, whose late father, Benny Gaon, was 
a strong backer of the Oslo process, wrote in an editorial of the 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot: QNow is the time to 
respect the rules of the democratic game and to understand that the 
majority opinion must be deferred to even if this is a Right-wing 
majority of voters.

¶I.  "Lieberman Unfit to Be Minister" 
 
The independent, left-leaning Ha'aretz editorialized (2/17): QAn 
investigation against Knesset Member Avigdor Lieberman is being 
pursued by the police, the Tax Authority, and the Israel Securities 
Authority on suspicions of serious charges including bribery, 
falsifying corporate documents, fraud, breach of trust, and money 
laundering.  Attorney General Menachem Mazuz has said the 
allegations are QsignificantQ.... Lieberman is thus disqualified and 
forbidden from heading the Public Security Ministry, the Justice 
Ministry, and the Finance Ministry in light of the investigations by 
the police and the Tax Authority, which operate under the Finance 
Ministry.  But his serving in any ministry, due to the depth and 
scope of the investigation, is highly unreasonable and 
inappropriate, and it is doubtful whether it will pass legal muster. 
 In this situation it would behoove the investigators and 
prosecutors to make every effort to expedite the matter of the 
Yisrael Beiteinu chairman, removing the cloud over him.  It is 
incumbent upon Mazuz to update the public and the person who forms 
the next government on the latest developments regarding the 
QsignificantQ suspicions against Lieberman, without harming the 
investigation. 
 
II.  "What Are They Afraid of?" 
 
Leading industrialist Moshe Gaon, whose late father, Benny Gaon, was 
a strong backer of the Oslo process, wrote in an editorial of the 
mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (2/17): QOver the past 
few days I have been hearing the voices of many of my friends in the 
business and media communities angrily demanding a national unity 
government.  Most of them voted for Kadima or Labor.  They now want 
to see their representatives sit with Likud and the Right.... There 
have not been any rules in Israeli politics for a long time.... A 
lame and forced solution in the form of a broad-based government 
that would rule by rotation is not intended to serve the state.  It 
is a cover-up for lack of willingness on the part of some 
politicians and media people -Q which I regret, too -Q to see the 
Right win and the Left lose.... Now is the time to respect the rules 
of the democratic game and to understand that the majority opinion 
must be deferred to even if this is a Right-wing majority of 
voters.
