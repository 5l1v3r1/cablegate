HAMAS? 
 
REF: STATE 14575 
 
¶1. (SBU) We delivered reftel demarche on February 25 to MFA 
Counselor for Israel and Palestine Aleksandr Rudokov, who 
said that Russia recognized the importance of the March 2 
conference in Sharm al-Sheikh to address the humanitarian 
needs of the Palestinian people, but previous commitments 
could prevent FM Lavrov from attending.  Lavrov is presently 
scheduled to accompany Medvedev to Italy on March 1 and Spain 
on March 2, although the MFA hoped that he could make it to 
Sharm al-Sheikh in time to participate in the conference. 
(Note:  MFA North America Department Director Neverov told 
the DCM on February 25 that he believed Lavrov would go to 
Sharm.)  Rudokov could not say what Russia would contribute 
to Palestinian reconstruction, which could be in the form of 
a combined financial and in-kind contribution. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Rudokov responded to the U.S. intention to address 
the humanitarian needs of Gaza through the Palestinian 
Authority and UN, while isolating Hamas, by asking how it 
would be possible to deliver aid to Gaza and reconstruct 
badly damaged infrastructure and housing without Hamas 
involvement.  The PA did not have the ability to deliver aid 
to Gaza, and even the UN could not work there without dealing 
with Hamas, he maintained.  Rudokov could not say whether the 
GOR would press this point during the March 2 conference, but 
reminded us that Russia did not consider it prudent to 
isolate Hamas, which needed to reconcile with the PA and be 
part of a meaningful peace agreement between Israel and the 
Palestinians.
