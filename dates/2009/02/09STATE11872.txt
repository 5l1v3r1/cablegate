¶1. (U) In response to reftel Leahy vetting requests, the 
Department has reviewed its files and finds it possesses no 
credible information of gross violations of human rights at 
this time by the members of the Lebanese Internal Security 
Forces and Lebanese Armed Forces personnel listed in reftels. 
If at any time the Embassy becomes aware of any information 
regarding incidents which could be deemed to be credible 
information of a gross violation of human rights by these 
individuals, the Embassy should so inform the Department. 
(Note:  Reftel Antonios-Irwin email exchanges include 
Lebanese Armed Forces vetting groups AH, AI, AJ, and AK, yet 
to arrive by cable but vetted by the Department.  End note.)
