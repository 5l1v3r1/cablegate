REF: STATE 4730 
 
(SBU) On February 4 Econoff discussed reftel points with 
Allan MacGillivray, Director of Industry Framework Policy, 
Telecommunications Policy Branch, Industry Canada. 
MacGillivray stated Canada chooses not to participate in or 
offer comment for the 1377 process but that he is happy to 
discuss Canada's telcom policy.  He said that the Government 
of Canada has not yet announced which recommendations from 
the "Compete to Win" report (referenced in the industry 
submissions) - including the recommendation to ease foreign 
ownership restrictions for the telecommunication industry - 
the Government will seek to implement.  MacGillivray noted 
that the federal budget, which was introduced last week, made 
reference to the Government's intent to respond to this 
report.  MacGillivray explained that he sees this reference 
within the budget as evidence of the Government's intent to 
issue a response "sooner rather than later".
