SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: NORTH KOREA 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies continued to focus 
February 26 news coverage on the debate between the ruling and 
opposition parties over whether Taiwan should sign a Comprehensive 
Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with China; and on the 
on-going investigation into the corruption case against former 
President Chen Shui-bian and his family.  In terms of editorials and 
commentaries, a column in the centrist, KMT-leaning "China Times" 
discussed North Korea's relations with the United States and said it 
seems quite obvious that Pyongyang wants to dominate the situation 
on the Korean Peninsula.  End summary. 
 
"North Korea Wants to Dominate the Situation on the Korean 
Peninsula" 
 
The "International Lookout" column in the centrist, KMT-leaning 
"China Times" [circulation: 150,000] wrote (2/26): 
 
"Pyongyang said what it is about to launch is an artificial 
satellite, but other countries such as Japan and South Korea say 
North Korea plans to launch a long-range ballistic missile.  Nothing 
has really happened yet, but the international community has grown 
anxious about [the situation on the Korean Peninsula].  It seems 
quite obvious that everything happening on the Korean Peninsula is 
dancing to the tune of North Korea, and that Pyongyang has full 
control [of the situation on the peninsula]. ...  [North Korean 
Leader] Kim Jong Il ..., in contrast, adopted a proactive strategy 
by deploying a battle formation first and then awaiting [U.S. 
President Barack] Obama's reaction.  [North Korea] started by 
sending out a series of war threats to South Korea, followed by 
declarations that it is about to launch satellites or long-range 
missiles, just one step short of [announcing that it will] carry out 
a nuclear test explosion.  Pyongyang's plan was to seek to define 
its nuclear policy first -- namely, there is no way it will 
compromise [on the nuclear issue], and that it will not hesitate in 
any way to retain its status as a nation in possession of nuclear 
weapons. ... 
 
"Kim Jong Il ... basically does not trust the United States, as any 
commitment the United States makes with other countries will likely 
be changed overnight, and things like communiques can be regarded as 
waste paper.  There have been too many such precedents, which also 
happened between China and the United States.  Given Pyongyang's 
strength, it will be nothing if it does not hold the nuclear weapons 
card tightly in its hand; joint forces from the United States, Japan 
and South Korea will be able to choke it to death easily. ..."
