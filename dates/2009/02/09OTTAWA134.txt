REF: OTTAWA 132 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: In separate remarks on February 23, Canada's top 
two diplomats reiterated Canada's top foreign policy priorities -- 
relations with the U.S., the Americas, Afghanistan, and emerging 
markets in Asia -- and its support for humanitarian aid to Gaza. 
Canada will further narrow its priority targets for assistance from 
25 to 20 (including six in the Americas) under the government's "Aid 
Effectiveness Agenda."  End summary. 
 
TOP PRIORITIES 
-------------- 
 
¶2.  (U)  On the same day that Prime Minister Stephen Harper was 
making a major public relations push in New York City, and on the 
eve of Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon's meeting with Secretary 
Clinton in Washington, FM Cannon on February 23 reiterated the 
foreign policy priorities of the government in a public speech, 
while Minister for International Cooperation Bev Oda announced a 
reduction in priority assistance targets from 25 to 20. 
 
¶3.  (U)  FM Cannon underscored that relations with the U.S. remained 
Canada's top priority, noting that "there is no question that the 
continued good health of this relationship is vital to our 
prosperity."  He said that Canada agreed with the U.S. that "a 
secure and efficient border must be a central priority to ensure the 
steady movement of goods, [and] services and be able to deter 
terrorism."  He added, however, that the U.S. "is not the entirety 
of our neighborhood" and cited the Americas as an "area of dynamic 
economic growth" and as another top policy priority. 
 
¶4.  (U)  FM Cannon also reminded his audience of Canada's ongoing 
commitment to Afghanistan -- the largest recipient of Canadian 
assistance.  He described improvement of relations with the emerging 
markets of Asia -- "a major driving force in the global economy" -- 
as another top priority, and said that he would visit India in March 
as well as that Canada would open six new trade offices in China. 
 
¶5.  (U)  FM Cannon voiced support for greater international 
assistance to "quickly and effectively help the people of Gaza 
rebuild their lives," and commented that "peace and security in the 
Middle East region has to be sustainable and durable," while 
insisting that Canadian policy in the Middle East was "balanced" and 
not biased toward Israel.  One of his staffers subsequently 
indicated to reporters that FM Cannon might attend the March 2 Sharm 
al-Sheik conference on Gaza (reftel). 
 
TARGETED AID RECIPIENTS 
----------------------- 
 
¶6.  (U)  Minister Oda's separate announcement described the 
government's "Aid Effectiveness Agenda" to "make our aid dollars go 
further and make a greater difference for those we help," while 
still helping the people "in greatest need."  She announced that the 
20 top targets of focus (which will receive about 80 pct of all 
bilateral assistance) will include: 
--  Afghanistan 
-- Bangladesh 
-- Bolivia 
-- the Caribbean 
-- Colombia 
-- Ethiopia 
-- Ghana 
-- Haiti 
-- Honduras 
-- Indonesia 
-- Mali 
-- Mozambique 
-- Pakistan 
-- Peru 
-- Senegal 
-- Sudan 
-- Tanzania 
-- Ukraine 
-- Vietnam 
-- West Bank/Gaza. 
 
¶7.   (U)  The new list includes five recipients from the Americas -- 
Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, Honduras, and the Caribbean -- that were 
not previous priority aid targets.  Minister Oda confirmed that 
"there will be, again, a new approach to the Americas." 
 
¶8. (SBU) Oda's announcement stimulated a mild firestorm in the House 
of Commons' Question Period on February 24, with opposition MPs 
charging that the government was abandoning Africa and francophone 
countries.  Oda clarified that 45 pct of Canada's assistance would 
Qcountries.  Oda clarified that 45 pct of Canada's assistance would 
still go to Africa and that the government would meet its pledge to 
double its assistance (from 2001 levels) to Africa by 2010.
