SUBJECT: KHARTOUM EAC CONVENES AFTER MEDIA REPORTS ICC WILL ISSUE 
ARREST WARRANT IN NEXT FEW DAYS 
 
REF: KHARTOUM 146; 01/04/09 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The CDA convened Embassy Khartoum's Emergency Action 
Committee (EAC) on February 12 to review the Mission's security 
posture after the New York Times and several other major media 
outlets reported the International Criminal Court (ICC) will issue 
an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar Al-Bashir in the 
upcoming days.  In attendance were the A/DCM, USAID, POL, DLO, PAO, 
RAO, CLO, CON, OBO SSM, and RSO. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The security situation in Sudan has not changed since the 
EAC last met on February 1, when Sudanese and international media 
reported an ICC decision was imminent (reftel).  With the exception 
of a peaceful march and petition delivery by approximately 100 
students at UNAMID headquarters in El Fasher today, there has been 
no public reaction to the latest media reports.  High-level police 
and security contacts are responsive to requests for assistance, and 
armed police posted at facilities and residences engaged EmbOffs 
today with a business-as-usual demeanor. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The EAC will continue to monitor the situation closely and 
maintain active engagement with host government interlocutors, 
specifically MFA, police, and security contacts, to determine if the 
relationship is becoming icy.  When an ICC announcement is made, the 
Post intends to encourage staff to be low-key, and to allow a 
liberal leave and work-from-home policy.  The Embassy will remain 
open and staffed by Mission-essential security, communications, and 
Front Office personnel. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The EAC also reviewed the Consular Affairs-proposed travel 
warning language.  Because the six-month travel warning review has 
coincided with the publication of the New York Times article, to 
avoid misconstrued interpretation of the warning's release at this 
time, the EAC recommended to wait until Tuesday, after the holiday 
weekend, to finalize travel warning language.  This will give the 
EAC more time to evaluate the situation on the ground.  The current 
travel warning addresses both the threat environment and prudent 
security advice. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The EAC is most concerned about the potential for one of 
many loosely-organized extremist cells in Khartoum to be emboldened 
by increased anti-American rhetoric that may result from an ICC 
decision.  The RSO just concluded a two-day surveillance 
detection/attack recognition training program for all Mission 
chauffeurs and conducted a Surveillance Detection team practical 
exercise this week to address this concern. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) While the Mission operates on a heightened security level, 
many soft targets in Khartoum, to include dozens of NGOs, are not as 
disciplined or well-trained.  In addition to coordinating closely 
with the Khartoum American School (KAS) today, the RSO informed the 
EAC he will also be hosting an Overseas Security Advisory Council 
(OSAC) meeting on Monday, February 16.  The RSO will use this 
outreach opportunity to review prudent security and emergency 
preparedness recommendations with the NGO community.  Any change in 
the Mission's security posture or ICC-related developments will be 
reported via septel.
