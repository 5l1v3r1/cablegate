SUBJECT: HONG KONG DRAFTING ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING 
LEGISLATION 
 
REF: HONG KONG 0062 
 
¶1. (SBU) Hong Kong Financial Services and Treasury Bureau 
officials are drafting anti-money laundering (AML) 
legislation, which they expect to submit to the Legislative 
Council for approval in early 2010.  They hope to consult 
with U.S. agencies and experts as they draft the legislation. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Currently, Hong Kong's three financial regulatory 
agencies (the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Securities 
and Futures Commission and the Office of the Commissioner of 
Insurance) issue AML guidelines that cover the banking, 
securities and insurance sectors.  Hong Kong does not, 
however, have legislation/laws providing a statutory backing 
for these agencies' anti-money guidelines.  Additionally, 
during its 2007 Mutual Evaluation of Hong Kong, the Financial 
Action Task Force (FATF) noted that Hong Kong lacked 
sufficient oversight of informal financial entities (e.g., 
money changers and remittance agents), lacked oversight of 
non-financial businesses (e.g., lawyers and accountants), and 
lacked statutory backing for customer due diligence 
procedures.  The new legislation will remedy the weaknesses 
noted in the FAFT Mutual Evaluation and will provide a legal 
basis for Hong Kong's AML regime, the Hong Kong officials 
told us in early February. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Hong Kong's Financial Services and Treasury Bureau 
officials requested to consult with pertinent USG agencies as 
they draft their AML legislation.  Post has passed this 
request to the U.S. Embassy Beijing Financial Attache office 
and stands ready to help arrange such consultations.
