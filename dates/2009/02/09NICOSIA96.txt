Classified by AMB Urbancic,  reasons 1.4 B and D. 
 
¶1. (C) Status of Ship:  M/V Monchegorsk remains at anchorage in 
Limassol, although the Embassy has received reports it might have moved 
slightly owing to traffic conditions in the port area.  Cypriot 
maritime officials are conducting a more-thorough inspection of 50-plus 
crates onboard the vessel.  According to MFA sources, they have not/not 
checked the remaining 40-plus crates, which are inaccessible unless the 
Monchegorsk moves pier-side. 
 
¶2.  (C) Diplomatic Activity:  French Ambassador Nicolas Galey on 
February 2 hosted a strategy session with his U.S., British, and German 
counterparts.  Galey briefed regarding his latest Monchegorsk-related 
communications with MFA Permanent Secretary (D-equivalent) Nicolas 
Emiliou and Presidential Diplomatic Coordinator Leonidas Pantelides. 
RoC maritime officials continued to inspect the 98 crates on board the 
vessel, Galey relayed, "with much to look at and little staff to do the 
work."  The inspectors did not have the means to check 40-plus 
containers without off-loading the entire cargo at pier-side (which the 
Cypriots continue to oppose.) 
 
¶3.  (C) Much of the deliberations on the Monchegorsk had shifted to New 
York, Galey noted, with the Cypriot UN Permrep having informed his UK 
and French counterparts that Cyprus intended to report the results of 
the inspection to the Iran Sanctions Committee and ask the Committee 
what actions to take.  Locally, Galey felt it most important to ensure 
the P-3 and like-minded nations were speaking from the same page, and 
raised the necessity of getting European Union leaders more involved, 
especially HighRep Javier Solana. German Ambassador Gottfried Zeitz 
briefed that "the Six" (the EU-3 plus others) were set to meet in 
Frankfurt on February 3 to discuss Iran; Zeitz believed that Solana 
would attend, so this forum seemed natural to discuss the Monchegorsk. 
 
¶4.  (C) Zeitz repeated an offer he earlier had made to the RoC (under 
instructions) for carte blanche assistance on the Monchegorsk matter; 
such aid could comprise sending technical experts from Berlin or even 
dispatching a vessel that could remove the cargo from Cypriot 
territory.  Ambassadors agreed this offer provided the RoC a "way out" 
of its current predicament, should it choose to accept it. 
 
¶5.  (C) British High Commissioner Peter Millett raised the need to 
ensure that the CypriotsQ report to Sanctions Committee did not spawn 
unproductive bickering in New York.  He envisioned three possibilities 
in its drafting:  1/ Cypriots simply report facts of vessel inspection 
(with a violation of 1747 implied); 2/ Cypriots report facts and 
request a Committee determination vis-a-vis a violation; and 3/ 
Cypriots report facts, request Committee determination as well as 
marching orders on how to dispose.  Option 1 was preferred by all, in 
order to prevent lengthy delays in disposition.  The French ambassador 
offered, after reading UNSCR 1701, that the Committee ought to be 
asking Cyprus how it wished to proceed, not vice-versa.  Ambassador 
Urbancic recommended that we also let the RoC know that the Six should 
have an idea of what the RoC would say before the report was actually 
sent to the Sanctions Committee.  Ambassadors agreed to convey local 
P-3 thinking and repeat Germany's assistance offer to MFA's Emiliou; 
Millett will telephone the MFA diplomat and later share his response 
with the others. 
 
¶6.  (C) Also on February 2, Polchief called on MFA Middle East Desk 
Officer Dionysus Dionysiou and Russian Deputy Chief of Mission 
Alexander Shcherbakov.  Regarding the recent visit of the Syrian envoy 
to lobby for the MonchegorskQs release (Reftels), Dionysiou, who had 
accompanied former RoC Foreign Minister Erato Marcoullis on the RoCQs 
last official visit to Damascus in late 2007, assumed the Syrian had 
played hardball.  They felt they had Cyprus in a corner, emboldened by 
the RoC recently having broken EU consensus to support (vice abstain) a 
UNGA resolution on the Golan Heights.  No end-state other than an RoC 
decision to let the vessel proceed to Latakeia would satisfy the SARG, 
Dionysiou predicted.  Should that not occur, the Syrians would look to 
upgrade further their relations with the breakaway "Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus", and lobby hard on the "TRNC's" behalf within the OIC. 
 
¶7.  (C) Dionysiou also debunked Emiliou's assertion that MFA lawyers 
were questioning 1747's application on conventional (vice nuclear) 
arms.  "OP 5 is clear-cut here," he claimed.  Nonetheless, having 
participated in the EU's drafting of the amended (in 2007) common 
position that followed 1747's passage, he claimed there remained plenty 
of constructive ambiguity in the UN text. 
 
¶8.  (C) Shcherbakov claimed that Russia, at least locally, was taking a 
relatively hands-off position on the Monchegorsk.  UNSCRs 1747 and 1803 
prescribed flag state responsibilities and "liabilities," he claimed, 
but mandated nothing for owners (Monchegorsk's are Russian); as such, 
Cyprus was responsible for handling this incident.  Press reports that 
alleged Moscow was pressuring Nicosia to allow the vessel free passage 
to Syria were bunk, he claimed.  Rather, Russia had recommended that 
Cyprus complete its inspection, send the results to the UN committee, 
and act on its recommendations.  Shcherbakov expected to receive a copy 
of the Cypriots' findings no later than February 3.
