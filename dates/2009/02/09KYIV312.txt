INFORMATION AND REPORTING REQUEST 
 
REF: STATE 6970 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Embassy delivered reftel demarche February 11 to 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Directorate for Arms Control and 
Military Technical Cooperation NPT officer Maryna Yermakova, 
welcomed Ukraine's feedback, and left reftel points as a 
nonpaper.  Yermakova thanked us for our early work leading to 
the May prepcom, and noted that Ukraine's position on several 
of the issues raised is laid out in their working paper 
submitted for the 2008 prepcom ("Preparing for a Successful 
Review Conference 2010"). She said that Ukraine finds it 
useful to address some of the actions necessary to achieve 
Treaty objectives outside the context of the review process, 
although she did not mention any particular action as an 
example, and noted that reaching consensus in plenary is 
extremely difficult. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Yermakova underlined that Ukraine looks forward to 
discussion of nonproliferation issues at the bilateral 
Nonproliferation Working Group meetings in Washington 
February 24-25, and promised to notify Embassy if she had 
anything further before that time. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment: The NPWG is a near term opportunity for 
the US to engage Ukraine on NPT issues at the expert level. 
Embassy will continue to reinforce US priorities with 
Ukrainian policy makers in the months leading to the PrepCom 
and RevCon, and report back on GOU views as they evolve.
