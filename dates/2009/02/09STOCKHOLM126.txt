¶1. (U) In preparation for its EU presidency the Swedish 
government appointed Anna Karin Enestrom as Special Envoy to 
Afghanistan and Pakistan on February 20.  Enestrom currently 
serves as ambassador to Pakistan.  Bildt issued a press

government's goal to increase Swedish and EU engagement in 
Afghanistan, adding "Afghanistan will be a key issue during 
Sweden's EU presidency" and will be a key item in 
transatlantic cooperation.  Enestrom's role will facilitate 
the promotion of a more vigorous and coherent EU policy 
towards the region during Sweden's EU presidency.  Bildt said 
he apprised Special Envoy Holbrooke of Enestrom's appointment 
when the two met in Munich in early February.
