ROSTER OF U.S. OFFICIALS CONVICTED OF CORRUPTION 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶1. (SBU) In A recent meeting with Council of Ministers 
Secretary General Ali Alaq, Anti-Corruption Coordinator (ACC) 
provided a list of American citizens, official and private, 
convicted in U.S. courts in recent years on corruption 
charges in connection with U.S. reconstruction projects in 
Iraq.  The list, which provided details on the nature of the 
charges, date of conviction, and sentence meted out in each 
case, was issued as a public document by the Office of the 
Special Inspector for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR). The GOI 
official agreed that SIGIR's list of convictions was clear 
evidence that the U.S. matched its words with deeds regarding 
the importance of bringing to account officials and others 
engaged in corrupt practices. 
 
GOI PUBLICIZES THE LIST 
----------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Subsequently, on February 10, the GOI issued a press 
statement on the Alaq/ACC meeting, noting, in a reference to 
the list, that ACC had informed the GOI of "a number of 
corruption cases discovered by the American side relating to 
elements from the U.S. military and its contractors and the 
measures taken against them." 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) As in past meetings with GOI officials (e.g., per 
reftel), Secretary General Ali Alaq expressed his 
appreciation for this information, and the GOI's decision to 
publicize it is noteworthy.  We regard SIGIR's list of U.S. 
convictions as a useful tool in our efforts to counter any 
impression among Iraqis that the USG urges them to act 
against those involved in corrupt practices but ignores 
abuses by American citizens and firms. END COMMENT.
