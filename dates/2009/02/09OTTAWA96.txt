¶1. (U) The Department of Public Safety, Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police (RCMP), and Canadian Crime Stoppers 
Association have formed a new partnership to raise awareness 
about human trafficking and to explain how to identify and 
report suspected cases.  In this national campaign, the NGO 
Canadian Crime Stoppers Association will use a telephone 
tipline -- 1-800-222-TIPS (8427) -- for the public to report 
suspected cases of human trafficking. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to Superintendent Bill Ard of the RCMP's 
Border Integrity Program, the new partnership will allow the 
public to "provide critical assistance" to law enforcement 
agencies by facilitating anonymous reporting of suspected 
human trafficking.  Trained personnel staff the hotline and 
can pass on tips to investigating officers.  Callers receive 
a code number for use in all subsequent calls, and do not 
have to identify themselves.  An Ottawa-based Canadian Crime 
Stoppers Association staff member confirmed to poloff that 
operators and staff have received training to detect cases of 
trafficking, and have already fielded calls regarding two 
suspected cases.  A senior staffer for leading TIP activist 
and Member of Parliament Joy Smith (Conservative/Kildonan-St. 
Paul) told poloff that Smith had participated in the public 
launch of the partnership and was strongly supportive.  In 
January 2008, the Canadian government had dedicated C$6 
million to strengthening initiatives to combat TIP and sexual 
exploitation of children, a portion of which went to this 
partnership program (reftel). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Comment: This partnership is an encouraging example 
of how the government, law enforcement agencies, and civil 
society can collaborate to fight TIP.  It is a further step 
in the right direction.
