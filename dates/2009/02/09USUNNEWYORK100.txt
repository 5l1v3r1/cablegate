SUBJECT: MULET BRIEFS COUNCIL ON ESCALATING VIOLENCE IN 
DARFUR 
 
REF: USUN 000555 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  Summary:  As requested by the United States, A/SYG 
Mulet briefed the Security Council on February 3 for the 
second time in less than a week on escalating violence in 
Darfur. Mulet reported that JEM forces had withdrawn from the 
vicinity of Muhajeriya, scene of much of the recent violence, 
but that the Government of Sudan had nevertheless asked 
UNAMID to remove its personnel from the area. He said that 
UNAMID was determined not to evacuate, especially because 
thousands of local residents needed mission protection, and 
that SYG Ban had personally engaged Sudanese President Bashir 
on the issue. UK Perm Rep Sawers indicated that his 
delegation would circulate a draft PRST for the Council's 
consideration.  The U.S., France, Mexico, Burkina Faso, 
Austria, Croatia, Costa Rica, Uganda, and Turkey expressed 
support for a PRST.  Russian Perm Rep Churkin stated that the 
PRST must send a strong signal to rebel groups.  Libya 
maintained that the Council should consider an Article 16 
resolution for deferral of the ICC decision.   End Summary. 
 
Twenty-Eight Bombings in One Morning 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU) UN Assistant Secretary General for Peacekeeping 
Operations, Edmond Mulet, briefed the Security Council on 
February 3 on recent fighting around Muhajeriya.  Mulet said 
that within the last twenty-four hours, Government of Sudan 
(GOS) forces dropped twenty-eight bombs in the Muhajeriya 
area. He said that two thousand civilians seeking UN 
protection remain huddled around UNAMID facilities in the 
area. He confirmed UNAMID reports that the Justice and 
Equality Movement (JEM) had withdrawn its forces 50 to 60 
kilometers away from Muhajeriya and declared its willingness 
to withdraw completely if the area were pronounced a UN 
demilitarized zone.  He said the GOS rejected this offer in a 
press release.  Mulet also noted that UNAMID had been 
prevented on February 3 by GOS forces from traveling to 
Muhajeriya, and underscored the GOS obligation to honor its 
Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) guaranteeing UNAMID 
unrestricted freedom of movement throughout Darfur. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Mulet detailed the GOS request for UNAMID personnel 
to leave Muhajeriya, noting that when the Deputy Wali of 
South Darfur met with the UNAMID head of office, he asked 
UNAMID to relocate personnel from Muhajeriya, saying this was 
necessary to "prevent any unnecessary loss of life . . . 
similar to Haskanita."  Mulet said that the UN also received 
two letters, one from the Deputy Wali and one from the senior 
GOS liaison with UNAMID requesting that UNAMID personnel 
relocate because the GOS could not guarantee their safety. 
Mulet indicated that despite the GOS request, UNAMID elected 
to stay in Muhajeriya.  Mulet confirmed that 
Secretary-General Ban met with President Bashir on the 
margins of the African Union (AU) Summit in Addis and urged 
the GOS to exercise restraint and guarantee the safety of UN 
personnel.  Additionally, the UNAMID Joint Special 
Representative, Rodolphe Adada, met with officials in 
Khartoum, while AU-UN Joint Chief Mediator Djbrill Bassole 
met with JEM members.  Adada and Bassole will travel to Chad 
for further discussions with JEM leadership. 
 
U.S: GOS Must Stop Bombing 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Ambassador Rice said that the GOS refusal to cease 
all military action, given confirmation that JEM had 
withdrawn from Muhajeriya, was disturbing, as were GOS 
restrictions on UNAMID's freedom of movement.  She expressed 
U.S. support for UNAMID's decision to remain in Muhajeriya 
and commended SYG Ban's diplomatic efforts to reduce tension. 
 She warned members to watch for indications that the recent 
GOS actions were a prelude to much more aggressive action in 
the area even though JEM had pulled back.  She urged the 
Council to speak with one voice and to call for a ceasefire 
and an end to the GOS bombing campaign in a PRST.  She also 
asked Mulet for confirmation of whether the GOS had used 
white airplanes in its bombing campaign, in contravention of 
its recent pledge in the tripartite process between the UN, 
AU and GOS. 
 
Like-minded Members Weigh In 
---------------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The UK argued that, in the face of mounting 
tensions, the Council must act.  Therefore, the UK indicated 
it would circulate a draft PRST for Council consideration. 
The U.S., France, Mexico, Burkina Faso, Austria, Croatia, 
Costa Rica, Uganda, and Turkey indicated their support for a 
PRST.  France and Croatia called on all parties to suspend 
 
USUN NEW Y 00000100  002 OF 002 
 
 
military actions and comply with humanitarian obligations. 
Austria expressed concern for internally displaced persons 
and commended UNAMID for remaining in Muhajeriya.  Burkina 
Faso noted that the upcoming meeting in Chad between Bassole 
and JEM leaders is encouraging and characterized JEM military 
action as linked to the ICC issue.  Costa Rica, in response 
to other member states reference to the ICC, argued that it 
was not appropriate to mention the ICC in a PRST on the 
current violence and reiterated that parties must meet their 
ICC obligations. 
 
. . . And So Do Others 
---------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Libya said that no sovereign government would allow 
a rebel movement to control part of its territory.  Libya 
urged the Council to adopt decisive measures -- including 
sanctions -- against JEM.  Libya argued that as long as the 
Council fails to act against rebels, violence will continue. 
Libya also argued that JEM activities had damaged the 
relationship between Chad and Sudan and undermined Libya's 
work in facilitating renewed diplomatic relations between the 
countries.  Libya reiterated that efforts to pass an Article 
16 resolution deferring ICC action against President Bashir 
must continue. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) China joined Libya in asserting that the GOS was 
within its rights to combat actions jeopardizing peace. 
China said that an ICC decision against Bashir would 
jeopardize peace and the Council must ensure the political 
process is not impeded.  China charged that JEM has "great 
ambitions," and called on the Council and individual Council 
members to exert pressure on JEM.  Russia claimed that the 
primary flaw in Council discussions on Darfur has been the 
failure to address rebel groups.  Russia noted that rebels 
refuse to negotiate or accept ceasefires, and the Security 
Council does not seem to be able to address this because it 
has no real channel to them.  Russia expressed hope that the 
draft PRST would send a strong signal to rebel groups. 
Vietnam said that the Council's priority should be urging JEM 
to cease its provocation.  Vietnam observed that the GOS is a 
recognized state and UN member, while JEM is an illegal 
group. 
 
Mulet Responds to Questions 
--------------------------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) In response to Ambassador Rice's question about the 
GOS use of white aircraft, Mulet noted that the GOS had 
denied it but the UN would investigate this further.  Mulet 
also noted that the conversation SYG Ban had with Bashir 
would be detailed in the upcoming UNAMID SYG report.  Mulet 
also said that, although JEM had withdrawn, the situation is 
fluid; rebels move quickly and could be back in Muhajariya 
within two hours.  Mulet closed by noting that, so long as 
UNAMID's movement is restricted (in violation of the SOFA), 
UNAMID cannot accurately report the situation on the ground 
in Darfur.
