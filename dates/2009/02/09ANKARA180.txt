REF: SECSTATE 5834 
 
Â¶1.  On January 27, we delivered this demarche to MFA Security 
Affairs Director Metin Ergin.  He said the Government of 
Turkey has seen significant problems with misuse of 
charitable donations and entities for terrorist purposes in 
Europe.  The GOT is supportive of cracking down on abuses, 
but Ergin said there is no way to follow up on the ultimate 
disposition of money after it leaves Turkey.  Ergin said the 
information in reftel was timely, and he appreciated 
receiving the list of websites which are constantly updated. 
Ergin agreed to share this information with MASAK, Turkey's 
Financial Intelligence Unit, and the Banking Regulation and 
Supervision Agency.  Separately, we shared reftel with 
Senturk Uzun, Head of the Associations Department at the 
Ministry of Interior, which has primary responsibility for 
auditing non-governmental organizations in Turkey.
