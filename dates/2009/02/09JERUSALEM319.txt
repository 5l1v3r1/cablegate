¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  The municipality of Jerusalem has 
reissued existing demolition orders for 88 Palestinian homes 
in the al-Bustan area of East Jerusalem's Silwan 
neighborhood. An attorney representing many of the home 
owners appealed for USG intervention to stop the demolitions. 
 A representative of the NGO Ir Amim said the demolitions 
will allow the settler organization Elad to turn the area 
into an archeological park.  A Jerusalem City Council member 
said the homes were built illegally and probably will be 
demolished, and that the residents rejected an offer of 
relocation to other areas of East Jerusalem.  End summary. 
 
PALESTINIANS REQUEST USG INTERVENTION TO PREVENT 
CONTROVERSIAL EAST JERUSALEM HOME DEMOLITIONS 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Jerusalem attorney Ziad Kawar told PolOff February 
23 that the Jerusalem Municipality is moving forward with 
plans to demolish at least 88 homes in the al-Bustan area of 
East Jerusalem's Silwan neighborhood.  Kawar, who represents 
several al-Bustan residents said his clients own the land, 
but, because the GOI has designated the area a "green" zone, 
construction is illegal.  He said the GOI Interior Ministry 
on February 17 rejected a rezoning plan developed by the 
residents of al-Bustan that would help legalize their homes. 
Municipal inspectors on February 22 surveyed the area in 
preparation for demolitions, Kawar said, adding that his 
efforts in court so far have failed to repeal the orders.  He 
requested USG intervention, saying that only American 
pressure on the GOI will change the current plan. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Sarah Kreimer, of the Jerusalem-based NGO Ir Amim, 
told PolOff February 18 that the al-Bustan demolitions will 
allow expansion of the City of David archeological park 
(reftel).  She said the settler organization Elad, which runs 
the archeological park, plans to excavate the area and 
incorporate it into the park.  She said the demolitions will 
displace current residents and reinforce the Palestinian 
perception that the GoI is not dealing with Palestinians in 
good faith. 
 
JERUSALEM MUNICIPALITY SAYS LAW, NOT 
POLITICS, WILL DETERMINE DEMOLITIONS 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Yakir Segev, Jerusalem City Council member 
responsible for East Jerusalem Affairs, told PolOff February 
23 that the al-Bustan area is an important archeological site 
and, according to Israeli law, should be open space.  He 
downplayed any political aspect to the decision, saying the 
issue is one for the courts.  Segev told PolOff that he met 
with the residents of al-Bustan to discuss alternative 
solutions -- such as relocating the residents to other areas 
of East Jerusalem -- but that they were not receptive. 
 
PLO CALLS FOR GENERAL STRIKE; 
PA ANNOUNCES TOUR OF AREA FOR PRESS, DIPLOMATS 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶5.  (U) PLO Secretary General Yasir 'Abd Rabbo announced a 
general strike on February 28 throughout the West Bank and 
East Jerusalem in protest of the impending demolitions in 
al-Bustan.  PA President Mahmoud Abbas' office called the 
GOI's actions in al-Bustan a move towards "mass population 
transfer," and announced that high-level diplomatic pressure 
would be brought on the UN, EU, and USG to win their support 
for preventing the demolitions.  The President's office will 
lead a tour for diplomats and hold a press conference in 
al-Bustan on February 24. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The Silwan neighborhood is a Palestinian area of 
East Jerusalem that has experienced a growing Israeli 
presence over the past few years.  The neighborhood contains 
archeological sites associated with an historical Jewish 
presence in the area.  Home demolitions in this area would 
provoke strong Palestinian reaction.  This issue has led 
Palestinian press for several days.  Demolitions of 88 
al-Bustan homes would also constitute a powerful "fact on the 
ground," unilaterally removing a Palestinian population in a 
sensitive area of Jerusalem adjacent to the Old City. 
 
BACKGROUND

JERUSALEM 00000319  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
¶7.  (U) Following Israel's 1967 occupation of East Jerusalem, 
GoI authorities devised new town plans for the area 
surrounding the Old City, a key element of which was the 
designation of the area outside the Old City walls as open 
public land.  In the intervening years, scores of Palestinian 
homes were constructed without building permits in the open 
land of the al-Bustan area of Silwan.  In November 2004, 
then-City Engineer Uri Shitreet ordered the clearing of the 
Palestinian homes from al-Bustan.  Palestinian residents 
appealed to the Israeli Attorney General.  Largely due to 
international pressure, then-Mayor Uri Lupolianski suspended 
the demolitions and allowed the residents to present an 
alternative neighborhood plan.
