Classified By: DCM Jonathan Cohen, Reasons 1.4 (b), (d) 
 
¶1.  (C) Embassy officials at the Port of Limassol confirmed 
on February 13 the 0700 hrs local quayside arrival of the M/V 
Monchegorsk.  Unloading of the vessel commenced at 0800 and 
ended at 1030; Emboffs counted 98 containers off-loaded. 
Port authority contacts report that many of them will remain 
at quayside for an indeterminate time, as limited truck 
availability will make cargo transfer to the naval facility 
at Mari a lengthy and complex undertaking (Ref A). 
 
¶2.  (C) A mid-level Foreign Ministry contact told PolChief on 
February 13 that the government was pleased with recent 
developments on the Monchegorsk matter, as were "all major 
players."  Pressed to confirm that that list included Syria 
and Iran, the Cypriot diplomat nodded affirmatively and 
added, "it seems so." 
 
¶3.  (C) Late in the evening on February 12, after news 
reports had revealed the ship would pull into port the 
following day, the Ambassador telephoned Palace Diplomatic 
Coordinator Leonidas Pantelides.  Pantelides confirmed the 
media accounts, adding that there were three containers whose 
contents the maritime inspectors had been unable to discern 
(note:  this jibes with the most recent RoC letter to the 
Sanctions Committee, dated February 12 (Ref B)).  Pantelides 
declined the Ambassador's offer of USG technical assistance 
in determining the containers' contents.
