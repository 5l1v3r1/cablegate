information on the final disposition of a case involving Answer 
Technology Company and its two representatives, Lee Jiu-Shi and Lee 
Jui-Fan.  On November 12, 2008, the court found the two individuals 
and the company guilty of making 13 shipments of analog-to-digital 
converters, digital-to-analog converters, and microcomputer 
controllers to Xing Hang Yuan Technology, in Shenzhen city, the PRC, 
without proper authorization.  (The Xing Hang Yuan changed its name

knew that the U.S.-origin items required licenses for exports from 
Taiwan and that Xing Hang Yuan was an arms sales agent providing 
weapons and electronic parts to the aerospace, aviation, and arms 
industries in the PRC.  All items were made by Analog Device Inc., a 
U.S. company.  The two individuals were assessed a fine of

assessed a fine of NTD400,000 (approximately USD13,000).
