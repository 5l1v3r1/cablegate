MEETING 
 
REF: STATE 9099 
 
(SBU) Germany will likely participate in the reftel April 
2009 Garmisch Global Initiative (GI) conference, German MFA 
Assistant Desk Officer Marc Hinrichsen told Econoff. 
However, Hinrichsen noted that low staffing levels in the 
German MFA's office responsible for the Global Initiative may 
complicate their planning.  Hinrichsen was not able to commit 
Germany to moderating any of the panels, although he noted 
the request and stated he would advance it through his 
office.  He welcomed the information on the updated version 
of the Model Guidelines for Nuclear Detection Architectures 
on the GI Information 
Portal.
