End Key Points and Comments. 
 
¶1.  On February 8 the GOQ signed a memorandum of 
understanding (MOU) with the Iraqi Kurdistan Regional 
Government (KRG) paving the way for cooperation on 
infrastructure development, agriculture, and aviation.  The 
agreement was signed during a visit by the president of 
Iraq's Kurdish region, Massud Barzani, which included a 
meeting with Amir Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.  The MOU was 
signed by Imad Ahmed, KRG Minister of Reconstruction and 
Housing, and MFA Minister of State for International 
Cooperation and Conferences Khalid Al-Attiyah. 
 
¶2.  The terms of the MOU held out the possibility that Qatar 
would open a consulate in the Kurdish region, and that the 
KRG would open an office in Doha.  Imad Ahmed stressed that 
all agreements entered into between the KRG and foreign 
governments are done with the knowledge of the Iraqi Foreign 
Ministry.  Therefore, the reciprocal opening 
of offices would be subject to approval by the Government of 
Iraq. 
 
¶3.  Ahmed pointed out, however, that the MOU is part of a 
broader plan to deepen the political and economic relations 
between Iraq and Qatar, including the Kurdish region. 
 
¶4.  Yasser Al-Moeid, political officer at the Iraqi Embassy 
in Doha, told Poloff Caudill on February 9 that he had no 
details on the MOU other than those reported in the press.
