¶1. SECRETARY CLINTON'S VISIT TO ASIA 
 
"Secretary Clinton calls for 'When you are in a common boat, you 
need to cross the river peacefully together' between the U.S. and 
China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(02/17): "Secretary Clinton has become the 
first American Secretary, in the last 50 years, to visit Asia for 
their first official visit. Her concept of 'smart power' and the way 
that it will work in Asia, is likely to face challenges globally. 
Major U.S. media organizations have indicated that China is the true 
focus of the Secretary's visit to Asia. In Secretary Clinton's 
recent speech, she suggested that the U.S. and China were 'in a 
common boat and should cross the river peacefully together' which is 
an old Chinese aphorism. However, she has not relaxed concerning 
China's human rights issues and how she will discuss these issues is 
still unclear. 
Secretary Clinton's arrival in Japan has not yet removed Japan's 
concern that the Obama administration is 'emphasizing China and 
neglecting Japan.' Chinese experts have commented that Secretary 
Clinton's trip to Asia has obviously made serious considerations 
concerning the closeness of relationship, the importance of the 
different countries and the administration has tried to maintain a 
balance accordingly. On the closeness of relationship, Japan is 
closer to the U.S.; however, when it comes to whose issues is more 
importance to resolve, China weights more. In fact, the Chinese 
people don't care much whether Secretary Clinton visits Beijing 
first or second, but, Japan is quite sensitive about it." 
 
¶2. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"The timing and effect of the China-U.S. defense diplomacy" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(02/17): "Secretary 
of State Hillary [Clinton's] visit to China will re-open defense 
diplomacy, which is a positive sign for the steady engagement 
between the U.S. and China. It is important timing, because Obama 
just stepped in the post. It shows Obama hopes to continue contact 
with China. The defense diplomacy was stopped when the Bush 
administration stated that it would sell arms to Taiwan. It is 
reopening because the Obama administration realizes that this is an 
issue that it wants to, very sensitively, deal with. The reopening 
is also happens during Secretary Clinton's visit to Asia. It shows 
that Hillary [Secretary Clinton] wants to increase the power of the 
State Department by updating several different dialogues while 
speaking in China. Although the two nations have formed a certain 
strategic cooperative partnership, advancing further in the defense 
field is not an easy task. Some American strategists still see China 
as a potential enemy. So, as the core of national security, defense 
diplomacy will embody many uncertainties." 
 
¶3. ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN 
 
"Core issues for U.S. economic stimulus package and economic 
recovery" 
 
A Shanghai-based news company under Shanghai Media Group, China 
Business News (Diyi Caijing Ribao)(02/17): "There is little room for 
the Obama administration to adopt trade protectionism and exchange 
rate polices. Obama can only solve the existing problems in the 
financial and housing markets when the American economy has enough 
strength to fend for itself. First, the administration must resolve 
a large amount of financial bad debt assets as well as the 
government's difficulties in debt regulations and financing. The 
U.S. will use measures of trade protectionism and exchange rate 
manipulation to deal with the financial crisis and China. But the 
effect will be limited. Meanwhile, many countries including America 
and Europe are hoping that China will help them through this 
difficult time. The international currency and financial system 
reform, proposed by the EU, are calling for cooperation from China. 
China needs more various and flexible measures to expand its 
domestic consumption."
