Main Stories: 
------------- 
All papers lead with photos and reports on the February 2 meeting of 
Palestinian Authority President Abbas, Egyptian President Mubarak 
and Saudi Foreign Minister Al Faisal in Cairo, noting simply that 
the leaders discussed Egyptian efforts regarding a Gaza truce and 
restoring Palestinian unity.  Al Hayat Al Jadida's coverage adds 
that Abbas then headed to Paris for a meeting with President 
Sarkozy, while Mubarak and Al Faisal left for Abu Dhabi on an 
unscheduled trip.  The paper quotes Abbas stating in Paris that he 
categorically rejects Hamas'call to replace the PLO with a new body, 
while Al Ayyam's front page highlights a quote by a Hamas 
representative in Lebanon confirming that the group wants immediate, 
practical steps implemented for PLO reform.  Meanwhile, Al Quds 
provides a further read-out of the Paris meeting quoting Abbas' 
advisor Nabil Abu Rudaynah telling press that President Sarkozy 
expressed support for Abbas and that the two leaders discussed the 
role of France in the peace process, in light of the change in U.S. 
and Israeli administrations.  Abbas added, according to coverage, 
that he hoped that the EU would play a "political" role in regional 
peace talks. 
 
Al Hayat Al Jadida's front page cites news agencies in reporting on 
agreement between U.S. Middle East envoy George Mitchell and French 
Foreign Minister Kouchner on prioritizing efforts to reach a 
sustainable truce in Gaza.  The report adds that Mitchell and 
Kouchner met in Paris on February 2 and that Kouchner stressed the 
need to accelerate efforts to open crossings between Gaza and 
Israel.  Meanwhile, another article on the paper's front page notes 
that Hamas has agreed to a one year truce with Israel if the "siege" 
on Gaza is ended, but the group is "not in a hurry" to enter 
Palestinian unity talks. 
 
President Obama is becoming more popular among "Egyptian Islamists," 
according to Al Arabiya's website, as noted on an inside page of Al 
Quds.  Since his interview with Al Arabiya satellite TV, reporting 
contends that even radical Muslim Brotherhood leaders have voiced 
their hopes that Obama will deliver his first speech from a Muslim 
capital in Cairo, possibly at the Al Azhar mosque.  Muslim 
Brotherhood General Advisor Akif, however, is quoted stating that he 
is not interested in Obama's speech nor in the choice of capital but 
rather in the content of Obama's Middle East policy.  Reporting also 
quotes former Islamic Jihad leader Kamal Said noting that Obama's 
inauguration speech provides an opportunity for the "Islamic 
movement" to open dialogue with the West.  Expressing similar 
sentiment, another "radical leader" appealed via his website to Al 
Qaeda to declare a truce with the U.S. as a gesture of good will 
towards President Obama, the report notes. 
President Obama says that most U.S. troops will return home from 
Iraq within a year, according to an inside report in Al Quds. 
Another inside AFP story quotes a U.S. National Security Council 
spokesman commenting on recent reports of secret contacts between 
President Obama's advisors with Iran and Syria.  The NSC spokesman 
underscored that Obama gave clear instructions to his team not to 
initiate any contacts with foreign governments during the 
transitional period. 
 
The three papers front page an AFP story reporting that 
International Criminal Court (ICC) Chief Prosecutor Luis Moreno- 
Ocampo has begun looking into alleged Israeli war crimes in Gaza. 
Moreno-Ocampo's office clarified on February 2 that that the action 
does not mean that an official investigation has been opened.  The 
papers highlight that the ICC has received several calls from the 
 
JERUSALEM 00000228  002 OF 002 
 
 
Palestinian Authority and other parties requesting an investigation 
into possible war crimes. 
 
Al Quds' front page runs February 2 statements by Israeli Defense 
Minister Barak confirming that Israel does not intend to wage a new 
offensive on Gaza in response to recent Palestinian rocket attacks 
on southern Israel.  In addition, all front pages quote Barak from a 
campaign rally on February 2, stating that he proposes the 
construction of a 48km tunnel under Israel to connect the West Bank 
to Gaza, adding that the tunnel would be under Israeli control while 
traffic inside would be controlled by the Palestinians.  In further 
reporting on official Israeli statements, Al Hayat Al Jadida's front 
page reports that Israeli Foreign Minister Livni stated on February 
2 that she expects the Obama administration to pressure Israel on 
reaching a regional peace agreement.  Al Quds front page adds that 
Livni also called for the drafting of an Israeli peace initiative in 
Hebrew, "before an initiative in French, Arabic or English is 
imposed on Israel." 
Al Ayyam runs a front page AFP story quoting Iran's President 
calling for a boycott of Israeli goods and warning of renewed 
Israeli "aggression" on Gaza. 
 
Al Hayat Al Jadida's front page reports that the U.N. emergency 
appeal for Gaza has raised $613 million in assistance.  Reporting 
also notes that U.N officials have again called for the opening of 
Gaza crossings and stressed that the body will investigate Israeli 
bombings of its facilities in Gaza. 
 
Al Quds' front page reports that Israel has agreed to release most 
of the Palestinian prisoners on Hamas' list for a prisoner exchange 
deal that would free captured Israeli soldier Shalit.  Jailed Fatah 
leader Marwan Barghouthi would be released, while "a few differences 
remain regarding the release of Hamas leaders," according to 
reporting. 
 
The three papers front page reports on the Israeli military killing 
two Palestinians, one near the West Bank city of Hebron and another 
in Gaza.  Eight additional Palestinians were injured in Gaza on 
February 2, papers note.  -------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
 
1)  Saad Muhayo opines in Al Quds under the title, "Erdogan 'lost 
it' but won the world":  "The Davos Forum... is the secret 
international government that controls the fate of all the world's 
s 
leaders and peoples... In Davos, Erdogan lost much of his 
credibility with the international, secret government, the Jewish 
lobby and the Turkish Army, but, he made an undisputed win of the 
leadership [position] of the Islamic world.  It is true that this 
win won't translate into direct benefits in the arena of Turkish and 
Middle East geopolitics, but certainly it will ensure him a 
permanent seat of prominence in history." 
2) Regular columnist Rajab Abu Sarayah opines in Al Ayyam under the 
title, "Not just an organization [PLO]: "Declaring a new political 
authority for the Palestinians, besides... deepening internal 
division, also strips the Palestinians of their moral authority at 
home and abroad and takes away the representation that is recognized 
at Arab, regional and international levels.  It thereby further 
weakens Palestinians and strips them of their ability and 
aspirations to achieve national goals."
