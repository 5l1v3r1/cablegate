Title- Cleaning balance sheets 
 
Editorial in liberal A Folha de S.Paulo (3-24) states: "....judging 
by main stock exchange reactions, which showed expressive rises 
after the announcement of the measures [US$ 1 trillion package], the 
project was very well received. Nevertheless, its success will 
depend upon the private sector adhesion to the proposal, which 
remains unknown." 
 
Title- Poor ignoramus 
 
Op-ed in liberal A Folha de S.Paulo (3-24) by Eliane Catanhede says: 
"[Hugo Chavez's latest measures] indicate a tense meeting in 
Trinidad and Tobago but for Lula nothing could be better.  The more 
Chavez attacks, the more he [Lula] defends himself.  That is how he 
is consolidating his image as a moderate leader, able to "calm down 
the beast"[soften him].  This time, for Obama." 
 
Title- When Lula meets Obama 
 
Op-ed in center-right Estado de S. Paulo (3-24) by former Brazilian 
Ambassador to the US Rubens Barbosa states: "...The Washington 
meeting [between Presidents Barack Obama and Luiz Inacio Lula da 
Silva] was certainly important for its symbolism.  In practical 
terms, little will change.  The meeting was the recognition of 
Brazil's new role as a protagonist - the country presents itself as 
one with global interests - and another step towards its gradual 
differentiation in the South American context."
