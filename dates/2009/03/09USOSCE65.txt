Session 3: Private Users and Civil Society

¶2.  (U)  The third session concentrated on the role of the 
private sector and civil society in enhancing cyber security. 
 Robert Doheny, U.S. Department of Defense, moderated. 
Keynote speakers were Flemming Faber, Head of ICT Security 
Division, IT and Telecom Agency, Ministry of Science, 
Technology and Innovation for Denmark; Udo Helmbrecht, 
President of the German Federal Office for Information 
Security (BSI); and, Colonel Friedrich Teichmann, Deputy 
Director for Communication and Information Systems Planning, 
Ministry of Defense and Sports of Austria. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  Faber, in his presentation, The Importance of 
Public Private Partnerships in Information Security, 
described the high degree of mutual trust between a 
government and its citizens needed to ensure cyber security 
at all levels (FSC.DEL/34/09).  In Denmark this had been 
achieved through extensive public awareness-raising through 
education and public media.  Still, Fleming said the "culture 
of security" would take time to develop.  Denmark, through 
"soft law" or voluntary agreements between public and private 
sectors, was able to introduce an electronic signature system 
already used by more than 25 percent of adults in banking and 
interactions with the government. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Helmbrecht's presentation, Secure Identities in a 
Global Cyber World, focused on the introduction of a national 
electronic identity card (FSC.DEL/35/09).  The card is a 
response to the growing threats to identity security 
perceived by the German government, industry, and private 
citizens.  The card could ultimately be used to verify 
identity, nationality, age, address, eligibility for 
government services, and provide access to banking and other 
sensitive websites.  The card would also provide an 
electronic signature valid for many types of electronic 
business transactions.  In terms of threats, Helmbrecht noted 
the decrease in instances of virus and worm attacks relative 
to the rise of botnets and threats stemming from web 2.0 
technologies.  He stressed that a strong national program 
will focus on prevention through awareness and education, 
preparedness for incidents, and sustainability. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  Teichmann, in Cyber Security at Home: A New 
Perspective, set out basic statistics about IT use and 
described the range of vulnerabilities encountered by the 
private user (FSC.DEL/41/09).  He described the needs and 
risks of different segments of the home-use population.  He 
called for enhanced awareness of the demands of cyber 
security at all levels of use, with emphasis on private users 
and civil society.  Teichmann recommended industry develop 
inexpensive IT security systems for the home user.

Session 4:  OSCE Role in Cybersecurity

¶6. (U) Working session 4 examined the possible role of the 
OSCE in enhancing cyber security.  The keynote speaker was 
Robert Doheny, Program Executive, Defense Cyber security 
Implementation and Principal Director, Crisis Management and 
 
USOSCE 00000065  002 OF 003 
 
 
Mission Assurance, Department of Defense Department of 
Defense. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Doheny, in Keys for Achieving Collective Cyber 
security, compared the dangers of a cyber attack to that of 
an asteroid falling toward the earth because it affects 
everyone and requires international cooperation to devise a 
solution for protection (FSC.DEL/43/09/Add.1).  He noted that 
the number of attacks had increased dramatically since the 
mid-1980s, while the level of sophistication required by an 
attacker has sharply declined.  Doheny said that we are all 
part of a Global Information Infrastructure (GII) and noted 
the great extent to which we share threats and 
vulnerabilities across international boundaries and between 
the public and private sectors.  He underscored the need for 
the OSCE to play a role in building trust and confidence to 
achieve cyber resiliency and outlined the following elements: 
 improve shared defense-in-depth capabilities; improve 
Identity Assurance (IA) and Computer Network Defense (CND) 
interoperability; share cyber situational awareness and early 
warning data; link watch center-to-watch center operations 
and exercises; improve interoperability to protect and share 
CND/IA information; and, foster relationships with collective 
security institutions 
 
¶8. (SBU) Doheny proposed next steps for the OSCE to enhance 
the cyber security of OSCE participating States (pS).  These 
include: networking and training workshops; a self-survey of 
existing policies and practices; sharing best practices with 
the Meridian Initiative; a workshop to exchange lessons 
learned from exercises and identify opportunities for 
confidence building exercises; publish information 
requirements for an early warning network; and develop a 
framework using the Counter-Terrorism Network to facilitate 
law enforcement cooperation in tracing cyber criminals. 
 
¶9. (SBU) The Estonian delegation (Tiirmaa-Klaar), supported 
by Austria, noted that the OSCE was a good forum in which to 
hold the discussions, but more can be done to include other 
countries and institutions as well, e.g., Arab nations, Asian 
countries, and others.  Doheny referred back to his 
presentation, where he explained the need to "foster 
relationships with collective security institutions" as a way 
of increasing international trust.  He agreed with the points 
raised.  The Finnish delegation said that it is not only 
important to raise awareness and strengthen the level of 
trust between international actors, but it is also necessary 
to assist one another in the implementation of security 
measures. 
 
¶10. (SBU) Greece (Pavlidis)  played a live audio feed of air 
traffic controllers at JFK International Airport and said 
that there is not such thing as 100% cyber security.  Japan 
(Ogata) recognized the need for governments to work very 
closely with the private sector to develop cyber security 
measures, but without killing innovation (FSC.DEL/52/09). 
Ogata emphasized: 1) there must be domestic cross-sector 
coordination; 2) policy and lawmakers must collaborate with 
private industry prior to drafting any policy regulation or 
laws; and 3) there was a need for better regional policy 
coordination. Ogata also suggested that OSCE efforts could 
link to efforts began as part of the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) cyber security initiatives. He indicated 
that Japan was willing to share their initiatives and 
practices related to threats, risks and proposed solutions.

¶11. (SBU) The Turkish delegation (Begic) said there were 
inconsistencies between Turkey's national law and the Council 
of Europe Convention on Cyber Crime that had prevented Turkey 
from joining the convention.    The Turkish del approached 
USdel after the discussion and asked for assistance in 
reconciling legal obstacles. 
 
¶12. (SBU) The Russian delegation (Krutskikh) expanded on the 
Turkish point and said that Russia will not agree with any 
conclusion reached at the workshop if it included a 
recommendation that all pS sign on to the Council of Europe 
Convention on Cyber Crime.  Krutskikh called the convention 
"outdated" and said it is "now high time that we elaborate 
new rules."  He also said Russia wanted "some kind of legal 
regime" and definitions of terms.  Krutskikh said Russia 
cannot agree to an international document that uses terms not 
used in Russian legislation.

¶13. (SBU) The French FSC Chair (Gonzalez) gave the closing 
remarks (FSC.DEL/58/99).    Gonzalez reiterated a few points 
that stood out: the importance of teaching younger 
generations about cyber safety; the U.S. emphasized free 
speech in response to a concern about spreading propaganda on 
the internet and the U.S. caution against excessive cyber 
regulation; a national response to cyber threats, while 
important, is not enough; Russia's concerns about the 
definition of "cyber" and limits of sovereignty in 
cyberspace; interest in and importance of the UK's "Meridian 
Process"; the need for governments to cooperate with the 
private sector; and the general agreement with the U.S. 
position of "defense first." 
 
¶14. (SBU) Regarding the role to be played by the OSCE, the 
French Chair acknowledged that a global approach is best. 
Gonzalez said that protocols regarding information exchange 
and confidence building were necessary.  He recalled the UK 
comment on the Meridian Process.  Gonzalez ended with an 
assertion that the OSCE is a good forum for discussion of 
cyberspace issues and can be useful in promoting a global 
culture of awareness.
