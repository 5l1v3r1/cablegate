¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The most contentious political issue in South 
Darfur remains the presence of 90,000 plus residents in Kalma camp. 
Suspicious tribal leaders and IDP representatives speaking with 
poloff in Nyala expressed fear that the GOS intends to evacuate the 
camp to force its residents back home.  With a meningitis outbreak 
already underway in South Darfur (ref A), one camp leader said his 
sector lacks water and health care, and is running low on food. 
IDPs believe the security situation would not permit them to return 
to their homes, but worry that South Darfur authorities may have 
other plans.  One observer sees Kalma camp as the most politically 
motivated opposition group in Darfur, a characteristic sure to 
provoke a reaction from the authorities in the months ahead although 
the regime has been repeatedly warned against further violence in 
Kalma after the August 2008 massacre there.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Adam Ahmed, an IDP leader from Sector 4 in Kalma Camp, told 
poloff on March 18 in Nyala that the more than 90,000 IDPs there 
lack any health care, are running low on water, and are fearful of a 
future and long-expected GOS evacuation of the camp.  In the wake of 
the GOS expulsion of the major NGOs which operated in the camp, the 
highly politicized IDP leaders, partisans of SLM leader Abdul Wahid 
Nur, are wary of any moves by the Government of Sudan (GOS) to 
proffer food and relief supplies (ref A), believing that without any 
INGOs operating in the camp it is more vulnerable now to security 
incidents.  "The goal of the government is to evacuate the camp," he 
said, echoing the prevailing view within the camp, site of the 
August 25 killings of 35 camp residents (refs B and C).  Ahmed cited 
an internal statistic that 38 people in camp had died since March 4, 
including eight deaths of either women or children in childbirth. 
(Note: The UN was unable to confirm the figure.  End note.)  Similar 
to other sectors in the camp, Ahmed told poloff his sector had no 
operating (motorized) water pumps, no available health care, and he 
was unaware of a planned WHO vaccination campaign against 
meningitis. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On March 18, Ahmed Adam Rijal, the preeminent Fur Maqdoom 
(traditional leader) in Nyala, stressed to poloff that IDPs in and 
around Nyala face an increasingly perilous situation.  Calling the 
GOS expulsion order "very stupid," the widely-respected leader had 
consulted with Kalma camp leaders who have refused GOS assistance to 
the camps, asking the authorities incredulously, "You have killed us 
before, and now you come to help us?"  Insisting that the expulsions 
will precede further actions against the camps, he said, "Evacuating 
the camps was their idea from the beginning.  The camps are a 
political issue now."  Fully recovered from a recent debilitating 
illness, the elderly but fierce Rijal plans to travel to the Arab 
League summit in Qatar on March 30 to meet with regional Arab 
leaders over the plight of Darfuris. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Suleiman Ishaq, SPLM leader in South Darfur and Daju tribal 
leader, met with poloff on March 17 in Nyala to discuss his alarm 
over the recent radical steps taken by the GOS in Darfur.  "They 
want to evacuate the camps.  For them, the real problem is the 
existence of the camps - they are going to solve this problem the 
Sudanese way," he warned.  A widely respected member of the now 
defunct Darfuri Native Administration, Ishaq has developed proposals 
in the past for an IDP Parliament and a civil-society conference, 
but acknowledged that in the current political climate, such 
proposals would be even less palatable to the regime than before. 
Ishaq foresaw further suffering should humanitarian supplies to 
Kalma camp dwindle, advising the international community that a 
crisis is brewing should the GOS intend to force Kalma residents 
from the camp.  "IDPs cannot evacuate the camps.  They would rather 
die there than be forced by the government to leave." 
 
¶5. (SBU) Marcel Akpovo, team leader of UNAMID Human Rights in South 
Darfur, told poloff on March 19 in Nyala that while the acute 
immediate threat of catastrophe in Kalma camp may have been put off 
for another month, the camp's presence remains the most contentious 
political issue in South Darfur.  "Evacuating the camp has been the 
intention of the government for a long time," he said.  With Fur 
sheikhs in the camp refusing GOS authorities and pro-government NGOs 
access to the camp, Kalma camp remains one of the few places in 
Sudan in which the National Congress Party has no political space to 
operate.  "The strength of the camp is that they are very united, 
and they believe in a political cause," Akpovo said, adding that in 
his 20 plus years working in Africa, he has not seen a group of IDPs 
as politically motivated as those in Kalma camp.  "They represent a 
political opposition to the government here, and the expulsion of 
the NGOs is a cause for them."  UNAMID Human Rights and UNDP Rule of 
 
KHARTOUM 00000410  002 OF 002 
 
 
Law have led an effort involving local lawyers to negotiate with 
camp leaders for the passage of humanitarian  aid, according to 
Akpovo, who added, "The government will probably fill the 
humanitarian vacuum but won't fill the political gap - the UN has a 
role to play in this." 
 
¶6. (SBU) COMMENT: Kalma camp IDPs are as concerned as NGOs and 
donors that the GOS may use the current political stalemate over aid 
as an excuse to force their way into the camp, or cut it off from 
the outside world completely.  Up to this point, Kalma IDP leaders 
have succeeded in uniting the camp behind their cause, and also 
dissuading their residents from celebrating the ICC verdict.  Such 
political organization is admirable, but could lead to trouble if 
the GOS goes one step too far.  Both Embassy and past Special Envoys 
have repeatedly warned the regime in 2007 and 2008 against 
precipitous action to break up Kalma. This is a message that 
constantly needs to be hammered home with the NCP. Regardless of GOS 
intentions for the camp, and for IDPs in general, Post advises a 
strong public and private message from Washington against evacuating 
the camps, both to control errant NCP actors in South Darfur (who 
most likely led to the August 25 2008 massacre), as well as to allow 
Kalma IDPs to step down from the ledge to better engage in 
constructive dialogue over their increasingly precarious future.
