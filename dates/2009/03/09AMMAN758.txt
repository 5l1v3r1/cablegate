SUBJECT: FTA Joint Forum on Environmental Cooperation Results in 
Comprehensive Two-year Bilateral Work Plan 
 
¶1. Summary:  On March 3, the U.S. and Jordan held the third Joint 
Forum on Environmental Cooperation under the U.S.-Jordan Free Trade 
Agreement (FTA).  U.S. and Jordanian representatives highlighted 
examples of the two countries' continuous cooperation and commitment 
to strengthen Jordan's environmental management capacity and support 
economic development.  One key deliverable was the signing of a Work 
Program that outlines areas for bilateral environmental 
collaboration through 2011.  Activities aim to enhance environmental 
enforcement, strengthen biodiversity protection, increase private 
sector environmental performance, and increase environmental 
outreach.  The media provided excellent coverage of the event, in 
which approximately 50 stakeholders from the private sector and 
civil society participated as part of the public consultation 
process.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  Jordanian representatives from the Ministry of Environment and 
the Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature met March 3 in 
Amman with U.S. officials from the State Department, USAID, the 
Environmental Protection Agency, and the Department of the Interior 
for the third U.S.-Jordan FTA Joint Environmental Forum. 
Approximately 50 stakeholders from the private sector and civil 
society also attended, as well as participants from FTA partners 
Morocco, Bahrain, and Oman, which all seek to replicate the forum 
process in their countries.  Both the U.S. and Jordanian 
representatives highlighted examples of the strong and successful 
bilateral cooperation programs that have enhanced environmental 
protection in Jordan, including: institutional strengthening for the 
Ministry of Environment, enhanced environmental enforcement capacity 
for the Royal Rangers (formerly the Environmental Rangers), 
increased waste-water use in industry, biodiversity protection, 
development of eco-tourism, and increased environmental outreach. 
 
¶3.  Minister of Environment Khaled Irani and Ocean Environment and 
Science (OES) Deputy Assistant Secretary Dan Reifsnyder signed the 
2009-2011 Work Program (essentially a road map for bilateral 
environmental cooperation) pursuant to the U.S.-Jordan Joint 
Statement on Environmental Technical Cooperation.  Additionally, as 
part of the public consultation process for the Work Program, Forum 
participants held a robust discussion its various elements which 
focus on four priority areas: institutional and policy strengthening 
for effective implementation and enforcement of environmental laws; 
biodiversity conservation and improved management of protected 
areas; improved private sector environmental performance; and 
environmental education, transparency, and public participation in 
decision-making and enforcement. 
 
¶4. After the signing, a joint communique was released reaffirming 
the strong commitment of the United States and Jordan to cooperate 
on protecting Jordan's environment and improving the management of 
natural resources.  The communique also reiterated that economic 
growth and environmental protection are mutually supportive. 
 
¶5. Media coverage of the Forum, which was open to the public, was 
extensive and positive.  All national media outlets and 
international wire services gave prominent, primetime treatment of 
the event, describing the signing of the Work Program.  DAS 
Reifsnyder, quoted by print and radio outlets, emphasized U.S. 
support for Jordan's efforts to improve enforcement of environmental 
laws, as well as for the exchange of experts and for encouraging 
citizen participation in environmental decision-making.
