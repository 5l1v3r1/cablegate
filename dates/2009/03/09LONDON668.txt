¶1.  (S/NF) Summary.  A lawyer's visit to Roxana Saberi on 
March 9 indicated Ms. Saberi was encouraged by news of 
efforts being made on her behalf, but is generally distraught 
at her situation.  According to UK Embassy 
Tehran, the charges against Ms Saberi were brought in by a 
court which tries national security matters; she is alleged 
to have filed news stories after her Iran press accreditation 
was pulled in 2006.  Friends of Ms. Saberi's have expressed 
their personal concern to Embassy London and have passed to 
Poloff supportive e-mails about Ms Saberi said to be from 
Iranian Ambassador to Japan Araghchi and from a former USG 
official, and well known author, not personally known to 
Poloff.   End summary 
 
FCO Not Optimistic 
------------------ 
 
¶2.  (S/NF) FCO contacts on March 12 and 13 told Poloff UK 
Embassy Tehran expects, based on feedback from Saberi's 
lawyer, that her release is "not imminent."   FCO contacts 
told Poloff that both MFA and the judiciary have said 
Saberi's arrest stemmed from a writ issued by the 
Revolutionary Court, which tries national security offenses. 
FCO contacts said the UK Embassy is expecting to have contact 
with Ms. Saberi's lawyer in the coming days. 
 
Ms. Saberi's UK-Based Friends Reach Out 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (S/NF) The lawyer for detained American citizen Roxana 
Saberi visited her in Evin Prison on March 9, according to 
a telephone call London Iran Watcher (Poloff) received March 
11 (ref a) from a dual American-Iranian citizen working 
for BBC-Persian.  The U.S. citizen BBC caller, previously 
known to Poloff, passed on that, according to Saberi's 
lawyer, Ms. Saberi is emotionally distraught, but also 
somewhat encouraged by efforts being made on her behalf by 
USG and (unspecified) others. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Poloff's BBC contact said she was calling as a 
private citizen and expressed concern for the welfare of 
Ms. Saberi, whom she described as a close friend.  Poloff 
reiterated the concerns for Ms. Saberi's safety publicly 
expressed by the Secretary, that protection of American 
citizens abroad is the USG's highest priority, and that Ms. 
Saberi, her dual nationality notwithstanding, is entitled to 
the full range of USG protection and advocacy enjoyed by all 
U.S. citizens. 
 
¶5.  (S/NF) The BBC contact said her information on Saberi's 
arrest status came via a UK citizen, a London-based fund 
manager, who is also a  friend of Saberi, who has been in 
direct touch with Saberi's lawyer.  Poloff asked that any and 
all information on Saberi's situation and welfare be shared. 
 
¶6.  (S/NF) The BBC contact on March 13 told Poloff she and 
the UK fund manager and other friends of Saberi began 
receiving "spam" e-mails from Saberi's e-mail address after 
February 1: the contact thought the e-mails might have been 
manipulated by regime authorities.  The BBC contact noted the 
e-mails used poor English, using Iranian-style syntax, and 
that the last e-mail the BBC contact had received that she 
thought was clearly from Roxana herself had been January 29. 
 
Her Friends Know Araghchi 
------------------------- 
 
¶7.  (S/NF) The BBC contact noted that the fund manager is not 
herself Iranian but had, as a private student in 2006, 
studied at a Tehran think tank associated with Iran's Foreign 
Ministry (she was uncertain of the name or 
acronym), and that the fund manager's tutor is now Iran's 
Ambassador to Japan, Syed Abbas Araghchi. 
 
¶8.  (S/NF) The fund manager, who called Poloff March 16, also 
forwarded to Poloff an e-mail (ref c) she said she had 
received March 9 from Ambassador Araghchi.  Araghchi's e-mail 
says: "I fully understand your sympathy and concerns about 
Roxana.  Good news are coming And I am confident she will be 
freed soon (sic)." 

Bob Baer Reportedly Says 
IRI Gesture is in the Works 
--------------------------- 
 
¶9.  (S/NF) The fund manager also forwarded to Poloff an 
e-mail (ref c) she had received March 10, apparently from 
former USG official and author Bob Baer; Baer's e-mail states 
"Iranians will release her in a gesture to the U.S., 
especially as Afghan talks get under way.  Any relevant 
updates I will send through (sic).  We are very anxious that 
Roxana be released as soon as possible and let me know if I 
can help in any way." 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶10. (S/NF)  UK Embassy's informal focus on the Saberi case 
appears to be active and continuing, despite the ending last 
week of Ambassador Adam's tour in Iran; FCO contacts March 13 
told Poloff that IRI authorities have granted "agrement" for 
incoming Ambassador Simon Gass, who is due to arrive in 
Tehran in mid-April.  Celebrations of the Persian New Year, 
which begin this week and traditionally continue in Iran to 
the end of March, conceivably may delay the regime's decision 
process. 
 
¶11.  (S/NF) Embassy can neither directly assess Baer's 
statement nor predict with precision what role if any 
Ambassador Araghchi may be playing as the Iranian regime 
considers its detention of Ms. Saberi.   Araghchi,  by 
reputation a moderate, able, and respected diplomat, and 
described by his former pupil, the London fund manager, as "a 
wonderful man," was briefly mentioned (ref b), in connection 
with Qalibaf's Japan visit last fall.  While Araghchi was 
Deputy Foreign Minister (2006-2007) there was speculation in 
the press and among some Poloff contacts that policy tensions 
between Araghchi and Ahmedinejad contributed to Araghchi's 
subsequent posting to Tokyo.  Araghchi's relationship to his 
former students (the fund manager and the AmCit BBC contact) 
appears cordial.
