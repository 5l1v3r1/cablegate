INTENTIONS TO PURSUE BILATERAL START FOLLOW-ON AGREEMENT: 
RUSSIAN RESPONSE 
 
REF: STATE 30048 
 
We delivered reftel demarche to Vladimir Yermakov, MFA 
Director for Strategic Capabilities Policy on March 31. 
Yermakov expressed appreciation for the notification, 
commenting that there had been a preliminary discussion with 
the Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukrainian delegations at the last 
session of the Joint Compliance and Inspection Commission 
(JCIC) meeting that the follow-on to the START Treaty would 
be a bilateral agreement between the U.S. and Russia.  He 
said Moscow had intended to follow up with the three 
countries, but it had not happened. In any event, Russia and 
the U.S. agreed that the follow-on treaty should be a 
bilateral one.  He expected there would be further discussion 
at the next JCIC and said Russia would like to consult with 
the U.S. on a joint position prior to that meeting.
