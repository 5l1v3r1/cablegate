SUBJECT: THANK YOU TO EMBASSY DAMASCUS 
 
Maura, 
 
I want to thank you and the entire Mission for the 
outstanding support provided during my travel to Damascus. 
This visit, a significant milestone in U.S.-Syria relations, 
was undoubtedly a team effort and Embassy Damascus, through 
its hard-work and professionalism, exemplified the best of 
the State Department. 
 
I would like to commend the entire Management and RSO teams 
for their work to support our schedule.  Specifically, Dan 
Chase, John Pigman, and Rashad Mansour who ensured our 
protection on the ground, and Susan Walsh, Khaled Hajj-Mousa, 
Antoun Nahas, and Moaz Mansour who facilitated the logistics 
of our visit.  To the public affairs office, specifically 
Kathy Van de Vate, Tracy Roberts and Wael Sawah, I must note 
that rarely does travel to one country make such news.  Their 
efforts to develop and implement a press strategy ensured our 
message reached both international and domestic media. 
 
To Tim Pounds, Russ Comeau and Andrew Boyd, thank you for the 
on-the-ground context and thorough reporting.  To Tim 
specifically, it was a long meeting.  Thank you for the 
comprehensive cables. (Did we set a record, Tim, for most 
number of cables out of a single meeting?).  I must commend 
Andy Abell whose efforts as control officer were truly 
exceptional.  His departure from Damascus this summer will be 
our gain, and I look forward to working with him more closely 
when he becomes Syria Desk Officer.  To all those in the 
Mission - and I know there were many - whose tireless, 
behind-the-scenes efforts made this trip a resounding 
success, please convey my sincerest appreciation. 
 
Lastly, to you and George, thank you both.  The trip's 
success is a testimony to your leadership and dedication.  I 
understand the toll these types of visits have on an embassy. 
 I appreciate your efforts all the more after seeing Post's 
inadequate facilities.  I assure you that all of us in 
Washington are committed to making progress on a new embassy 
compound, and are prepared to support you in any way we can. 
Maura, also thank you for providing my accommodations. 
 
Best, 
 
Jeff
