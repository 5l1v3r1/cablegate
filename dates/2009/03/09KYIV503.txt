REF: STATE 15113 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Embassy Reviewed the S/CT request regarding critical 
infrastructure and key resources (CI/KR).  Embassy's 
assessment is that CI/KR in Ukraine, if destroyed, disrupted 
or exploited, would not likely have an immediate and 
deleterious effect on the United States, and therefore does 
not meet the criteria as outlined in REFTEL.
