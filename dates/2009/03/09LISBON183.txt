(SBU) Portuguese MFA interlocutors were grateful for the 
reftel information, but did not have a prepared response 
given the pressures of preparation for the NATO Summit and 
the International Conference on Afghanistan.  Portuguese MOD 
and MFA interlocutors have recently made announcements of 
additional contributions to ISAF, particularly during the 
upcoming election period, for which Portugal committed to 
contribute a C-130.
