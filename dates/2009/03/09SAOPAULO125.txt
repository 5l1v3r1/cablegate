Recession and Protectionism: lessons and errors from the past 
 
Op-ed in business oriented Valor Econtmico (3-5) by economist 
Marcelo Piancasteli from the Institute of Applied Economic Research 
(IPEA). Several years ago, on an invitation from the State 
Department, Mr. Piancasteli, on a student program, visited 
Pittsburgh, PA, an area with high concentration of steel mills. On 
this industry, he now states: "The U.S. steel industry has improved, 
but has not turned globally competitive....In the package of 
measures proposed by President Obama's administration to fight 
recession, there is an astute article to limit steel imports, which 
brings back the time old adage of protectionism: protect jobs in 
industries with no conditions to compete in the global market....The 
current  initiative.... this allows us to review past lessons....We 
know today that U.S. protectionism, along with other mistakes in 
monetary policy, only prolonged [1929] recession, which lasted 10 
years and only ended because World War II started."
