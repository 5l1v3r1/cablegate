TITLE- THE NEW U.S. DIPLOMACY 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (3-8) states: "U.S. 
Secretary Hillary Clinton's first international trip to the Middle 
East and to Europe indicated a substantial shift...in U.S. diplomacy 
under Barack Obama's administration.  At Washington's instigation 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has re-established 
formal relations with Russia....The initiative shows Obama's concern 
to rebuild coherence between the means and the ends in U.S. foreign 
policy, which was buried by a series of errors made by the Bush 
administration.  The return to rationality does not guarantee that 
those ends will be achieved....but the change is indispensable to 
regain U.S. position on the world's chessboard."
