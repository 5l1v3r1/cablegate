REFTEL: E-MAIL #207003 DATED 3/13/2009 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to determine the 
legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, Novatest, Moscow, 
Russia. The company is listed on BIS license applications: NLR as 
the ultimate consignee of two optical instruments, appliances, 
electronic devices and components, two electrical machines and 
apparatus, and other navigation direction finding equipment, 
airborne communication equipment, all aircraft inertial navigation 
systems. These items are controlled for national security, 
anti-terrorism, missile technology, nuclear non-proliferation and 
regional stability reasons under ECCN 3A001, 3A992 and 7A994. The 
licensee is Lansmont Corporation, 17 Mandeville Court, Monterey, CA 
¶93940. 
 
¶3. On March 23, 2009, Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested post-shipment 
verification at the offices of Novatest, 7A, Staropetrovsky proezd, 
Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with Gennady Levkovsky, 
General Director. 
 
¶4. Novatest was founded in 2005 from a former division of the ASM 
Test and Measurement company.  Mr. Levkovsky is the sole owner of 
Novatest, and had worked for ASM for 12 years prior to the creation 
of Novatest.  The company provides testing and measurement equipment 
to various end users throughout Russia and the CIS countries. 
Novatest employs 50 people in four office locations: Moscow, St. 
Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Ukraine. The principal end users for 
this equipment are in the metallurgical field. Novatest carries 
equipment from several manufacturers, most notably Instron, LDS 
vibration testing devises and Rotodata Telemetry Systems for turbine 
engines. Novatest was the subject of a previous positive end use 
check on March 2, 2006. 
 
¶5. The commodities in reftel were imported by Novatest as parts of a 
transportation vibration recorder system, also called a shaker, with 
GPS options. All shakers less than 4 tons come under export control. 
Novatest imports approximately 20 shaker systems a year. The end 
user of the reftel commodities, Scientific-Production Association of 
Applied Mechanics, is a producer of telecommunication satellites 
located in Krasnoyarsk, Russia. The satellites are transported to 
the Russian launch facility in Kazakhstan by railroad. During 
transport, the reftel commodity will record, and transmit back to 
Krasnoyarsk, any shock or serious vibration to the satellite. 
 
¶6. The export control team was provided a copy of the sale contract 
and shipping records for the reftel commodities, thereby accounting 
for the entire shipment. The equipment was used for the end use for 
which it was licensed. There were no indications of impropriety and 
Gennady LevkovskyQs answers were not evasive to the export control 
team. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post recommends Novatest, Moscow, Russia, as a 
reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
