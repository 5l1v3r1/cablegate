Title- "Brazil Omits itself" 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (3-30) states: "....In 
addition to the classic repressive apparatus, Kim Jong-il [North 
Korean leader] presents odious particularities....the United Nations 
Human Rights Council last week approved a resolution condemning Kim 
Jong-il's regime.  Brazil abstained from voting.  In the 
Sudan....300,000 people have died in the Darfur's region and the 
life of 2 million refugees hangs in the balance.  Brazil does not 
condemn the Sudanese regime....More than 90 countries have approved 
a U.N. resolution banning cluster bombs....Also in this matter, 
Brazil omits itself.  It is not by courting dictators and 
malefactors that Brazil will take over a leading role in the world - 
a role that Lula's government says it so desires..." 
 
Title- "Iran and the 'new beginning' 
 
Editorial in center-right Estado de S.Paulo (3-30) says: "....With 
regards to the bilateral relationship with the U.S., Teheran's first 
reaction was cold, as one would anticipate.  [Iran] subjected the 
resumption of talks, halted in 1980,....to an apology, among others, 
for the U.S. having shot down  a commercial Iranian jet in 1998, 
killing 290 people....Obama represents a complication for the 
Iranian government.  At least it is now harder to keep on calling 
the U.S. the 'great Satan"....No one can see under which political 
conditions an Iranian leader would have to subject its nuclear 
program to international surveillance or to accept the transference 
of its uranium enrichment to another State....Even among Iranians of 
the Occidentalized middle class the right of its country to its 
nuclear activities is nonnegotiable."
