SUBJECT: GRENADA WEEKLY ACTIVITY REPORT FOR FEBRUARY 22 - 28, 2009 
 
¶1. Embassy Grenada's weekly report (GWAR) provides a little 
detail about events of interest that do not merit longer 
reporting at this time. 
 
¶2. Begin GWAR text: 
 
a. Israeli Ambassador Meets PM Thomas 
Prime Minister Tillman Thomas last week met discussions with 
Israeli Ambassador, His Excellency Amos Radian. They discussed 
matters of mutual concern and areas of bilateral cooperation 
with specific emphasis on agriculture and training. The Prime 
Minister pointed out that Grenada was experiencing some 
difficulty in benefiting from some of the training programs 
offered by Israel due to the high cost of travel. The Ambassador 
said the issue is being addressed by Israel through the 
involvement of UN Agencies who will help by paying the airfare 
for persons accessing training opportunities in Israel, while 
Grenada will meet all other expenses. 
 
b. Chinese Minister Visits Grenada 
The Chinese Minister of International Affairs Wang Jairu visited 
Grenada last week seeking clarity on several issues, including 
the regional discussions on economic and political union. He 
indicated that the PRC supports the idea. Minister Wang Jairu 
also discussed with Prime Minister Tillman Thomas a possible 
increase in technical co-operation in the areas of Education, 
Agriculture and Agro processing. PM Thomas said Grenada has 
designed a strategy to process fruits, both for local 
consumption and for export. He noted that markets for Grenadian 
products were available in the region and in the Grenadian 
Diaspora, particularly the United States. 
 
c. Nazim Burke Elected NDC DPL 
In a unanimous vote during the ruling National Democratic 
Congress March 1 convention, Minister for Finance Nazim Burke 
was elected to be the party's deputy political leader, replacing 
Senator George Prime.  Minister for Foreign Affairs and Tourism 
Peter David withdrew his name from consideration several weeks 
before in response to NDC concern that a fight between him and 
Burke would divide the party.
