SUBJECT: EMBASSY JAKARTA PROPOSAL FOR SCIENCE FELLOWS 
 
REF: A) SECSTATE 10843 
 
SUBJECT OF PROPOSAL AND GENERAL INFORMATION 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (U) Embassy Jakarta is interested in the Embassy Science Fellow 
Program (ESFP) and requests Department assistance in identifying up 
to two interested candidates focused on marine and fisheries issues, 
with specific interest in the Coral Triangle Initiative, and climate 
change.  These fellows would work with the Ministry of Marine 
Affairs and Fisheries, and with the Ministry of Environment and the 
National Climate Change Council, respectively.  We would prefer to 
host a fellow(s) for 90 days, which would require a medical 
clearance.  Security clearance is not required, but is preferred. 
 
PROPOSAL DESCRIPTION 
-------------------- 
 
 
¶2. (U) Embassy Jakarta proposes that the two fellows work on two 
distinct areas of interest: the Coral Triangle Initiative and 
partnering with the Government of Indonesia (GOI) on climate change, 
both detailed below: 
 
-- Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) - Indonesia will host the first 
World Ocean Conference (WOC) May 11-15, 2009 to highlight the 
relationship between climate change and the oceans. The first CTI 
Summit of leaders from Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Papua 
New Guinea, East Timor, and the Solomon Islands (plus two partner 
countries, the U.S. and Australia) will take place at the same time. 
The Summit will officially launch a CTI regional plan of action to 
safeguard the region's extraordinary marine and coastal biological 
resources.  A science Qllow would pick up where this process left 
off by working with the Indonesian Ministry of Marine Affairs and 
Fisheries (MMAF) and the Indonesian CTI Secretariat to identify 
opportunities for partnership in areas of mutual interest such as 
marine protected areas and ecosystem-based fisheries management. 
NOAA would be the ideal agency for this project because it has an 
existing MOU with the MMAF. NOAA also plans to heavily participate 
in the WOC. 
 
-- Climate Change - Both the U.S. and Indonesia have made climate 
change a priority. Secretary Clinton recently visited Indonesia, 
accompanied by the U.S. Climate Change Envoy, Todd Stern. Indonesia 
has recently established a National Climate Change Council (NCCC), 
chaired by the Minister of the Environment, to coordinate climate 
change policies and programs. A fellow from the EPA would be well 
suited to develop relationships with the NCCC, and identify 
opportunities for partnership on specific initiatives such as 
Methane-to-Markets, clean technology for reducing emissions, or 
joint research on climate change impacts and adaptation measures, to 
name a few. 
 
ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT 
---------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Embassy Jakarta would provide logistical support for up to 
two prospective Fellows under the ESFP guidelines. We would provide 
secure office space on the embassy compound with appropriate 
computer, email and internet access. We will provide housing subject 
to availability for the specific dates proposed by the program.  The 
Fellows would also have access to the Embassy Health Unit (pending 
appropriate medical clearances), FPO and CLO. Embassy Jakarta's 
preferred timeline is a Fall 2009 arrival, Winter 2009 departure. 
 
RSO CONCURRENCE 
--------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Embassy Jakarta is not an unaccompanied post.  RSO has 
supported past Science Fellow assignments to Indonesia and supports 
the continuation of this program.
