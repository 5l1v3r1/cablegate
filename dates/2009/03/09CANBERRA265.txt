SUBJECT: AUSTRALIA PROSCRIBES SIX TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS 
 
 ¶1. (U) On March 18 the Australian Attorney General's Office 
announced the relisting of six groups as terrorist 
organizations under the criminal code because of information 
provided by Australia's security agencies. The relisting 
insures that it remains an offense to associate with, train 
with, provide training for, receive funds from, make funds 
available to, or direct or recruit for the following 
organizations. 
 
¶2. (U) Ansar al-Islam (formerly Ansar al-Sunna) and Asbat 
al-Ansar are extremist groups which continue to engage in 
terrorist activity in Iraq. 
 
¶3. (U) The Islamic Army of Aden continues to target Yemeni 
and Western interests in the southern governorates of Yemen 
and has previously kidnapped Western tourists, which resulted 
in the death of an Australian. 
 
¶4. (U) The Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan continues to engage 
in terrorist activity in Afghanistan in support of the 
Taliban and other Islamic extremist groups. 
 
¶5. (U) Jaish-e Mohammed (JeM) is an extremist organization 
based in Pakistan which continues to engage in terrorist 
activity in Kashmir including hijacking, bombings, abductions 
and training. 
 
¶6. (U) Lashkar-e Jhangvi is based in Pakistan and has close 
ties to Lashkar-e Tayyiba (LeT) which is also listed as a 
terrorist organization under Australia's counterterrorism 
laws and is believed to be responsible for the Mumbai 
terrorist attacks in November 2008. 
 
¶7. (U) One organization, Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) will 
not be relisted as it no longer meets the threshold for 
proscription, based on current intelligence that it has 
affiliated with other terrorist organizations.
