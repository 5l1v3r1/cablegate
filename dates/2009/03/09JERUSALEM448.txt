Main Stories: 
------------- 
All papers lead with statements by Egyptian Intelligence Chief 
Sulayman and Arab League Secretary General Amr Musa from the 
inauguration of Palestinian reconciliation dialogue in Cairo on 
March 10.  They encouraged Palestinian delegations to do their 
utmost to achieve reconciliation and unity as soon as possible and 
warned of the "dangerous consequences" of failure.  According to 
reports, Sulayman stated that if Palestinians agreed on forming a 
"national unity" government with all factions represented, he 
recommended that, "not so well known" members be seated in order to 
ensure international support.  The papers also run statements by 
Fatah and Hamas delegation members, including Musa Abu Marzoq of 
Hamas and Zakarayah Al Agha of Fatah, expressing optimism over the 
ultimate success of dialogue. Amr Musa commented to press that 
Palestinian reconciliation would form the base for any future Arab 
action. 
 
Al Quds' and Al Ayyam's front pages report that the Israeli 
Jerusalem municipality issued demolition orders to Palestinian 
residents of 11 houses in the East Jerusalem neighborhoods of Bayt 
Hanina, Ras Al Amud, Silwan and Shufat.  Papers also note that 
dozens of demolition orders have also been issued to Bedouins in the 
Jaba area near Jerusalem.  Reports further add that the Israeli 
Jerusalem municipal court has put stay on Israeli orders for 
demolishing 55 Palestinian flats in Rash Khmays in Shufat refugee 
camp in Jerusalem. 
 
Al Quds' front page runs a report on dozens of American, Muslim and 
Arab scholars and activists signing a letter to President Obama 
encouraging him to support democratic leaders in the region and not 
become concerned over electoral wins by "Islamic movements".  The 
signatories argue that a majority of "Islamic movements" are 
non-violent.  The letter was sent ahead of the expected visit by 
President Obama to Turkey and notes the importance of U.S. contact 
with the Arab and Islamic worlds. 
 
Al Ayyam's front page runs the red-font headline, "Occupation plans 
to build a police station adjacent to the Al Aqsa compound's western 
side."  Reporting explains that the Al Aqsa Waqf and Heritage Trust 
revealed the Israeli plans that they consider an Israeli effort to 
consolidate control over the mosque compound. 
Al Quds' front page runs results from a public opinion poll 
conducted by the Arab Research and Development Center (AWRAD) in the 
West Bank and Gaza between February 26,28. The poll shows that 64% 
of Palestinians object to establishing an alternate body to the PLO, 
81% prefer simultaneous Palestinian Authority (PA) presidential and 
legislative elections, and if elections were held today, that 
possible Fatah candidates, PA President Abbas, Marwan Barghuthi and 
Mubadara leader Mustafa Barghuthi would win more votes than Hamas 
candidates. 
Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida front page a report quoting an 
unnamed Hamas official revealing accelerated efforts to wrap up a 
prisoner exchange deal between Israel and Hamas. The report adds 
that the Israeli envoy, Ofer Dekel has returned to Cairo. 
Al Quds' inside runs a DPA report on Vice President Biden expressing 
support for U.S. dialogue with moderates in the Taliban in 
Afghanistan.  His statements were made following talks in Brussels 
with NATO Ambassadors. 
All papers run inside reporting on a visit by a USAID delegation to 
the Hebron Governorate in the West Bank to discuss USAID development 
projects. 
Al Quds' runs an inside report about the Israeli army removing a 
 
JERUSALEM 00000448  002 OF 002 
 
 
road block at the entrance of Bani Naim town near Hebron in the West 
Bank.  The obstacle had been in place for nine years and was removed 
by the Israeli military, reporting adds.  -------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
 
1) Omar Al Ghul writes in Al Hayat Al Jadida under the title "Why 
Salam Fayyad?"(03/11):  "There are compelling reasons for naming the 
Prime Minister to head any future national consensus government. 
But will they [Palestinian factions] stop their nonsense and 
boasting about what is beyond their capability, and seize the 
political moment and support the choice of a future Salam Fayyad 
government?" 
2) Al Quds' editorial is titled, "Gaza siege and the Lifeline 
convoy"(03/11):  "U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton recently 
sent a tough message to the Israeli government calling on the 
lifting of limitations on humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip. 
 There are hundreds of trucks waiting at the Kerem Shalom and other 
crossings.  The Israeli authorities do not allow them to enter Gaza 
and the result is the spoiling of food stuffs, medicine and other 
humanitarian assistance sent because of adverse weather conditions 
and lack of proper storage."
