SUBJECT: FRENCH WILL BRIEF AT RABAT SEMINAR ON CONVENTIONAL 
ARMS AND REGIONAL SECURITY 
 
REF: SECSTATE 19800 
 
(SBU) French MFA Desk Officer for Conventional Arms 
Nonproliferation Guillaume Habert advised on March 13 that 
the GOF will accept the U.S. invitation to participate and 
provide a briefing at the April 14-15 Conventional Arms and 
Regional Security Seminar in Rabat, Morocco.  Habert said the 
MFA would communicate the name of the participant as soon as 
possible, noting that sending someone from Paris might not be 
possible due to tight travel budgets.  In that case, an 
Embassy Rabat pol-mil officer would be provided appropriate 
materials for briefing on behalf of the GOF.  Habert noted 
that the GOF briefing will be in French, given the large 
number of Francophone countries likely to attend.  Embassy 
Paris' POC for seminar arrangements will be Annie 
Schlapprizzi.
