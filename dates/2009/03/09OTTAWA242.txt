     ¶C. BANDO-MATTEI E-MAIL OF 3/13/09 
 
¶1.  (U) Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade 
(DFAIT) Senior Advisor for Defense and Security Relations 
Sarah Robertson confirmed to pol/miloff on March 25 that 
Foreign Minister Cannon had instructed DFAIT staff to seek 
membership for Canada in the Contact Group on Piracy off the 
Coast of Somalia (CGPCS).  Robertson noted that the minutes 
of the March 17 CGPCS indicate that the U.S. hosts that 
organization's secretariat.  She requested instruction and 
points of contact by which Canada could pursue formal 
membership. 
 
¶2.  (U) Action request for AF/RSA and PM/PPA:  Given that 
Canada is a reliable and capable anti-piracy partner, Embassy 
recommends its inclusion in the CGPCS.  Please advise ASAP 
and provide any guidance on next steps.
