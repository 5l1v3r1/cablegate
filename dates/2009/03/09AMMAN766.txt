¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel demarche to Mohammad 
Tarawneh, acting Deputy Director for International 
Organization Affairs at the Foreign Ministry on March 25. 
Poloff requested the Government of Jordan (GOJ) consider 
offering support to AMISOM and Somalia security sector reform 
efforts.  Tarawneh responded that the GOJ would consider the 
request and respond in principle to the Embassy as soon as 
possible. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment:  Post will follow up with the Foreign 
Ministry for a substantive response.  That said, based on 
recent coordination of regional deployments and equipment 
transfers, financial support to AMISOM and Somalia security 
sector reform is unlikely.  It is possible that the GOJ would 
consider transferring equipment if outside funding were 
provided or secured by the USG.  Post believes that, based on 
past GOJ peacekeeping contributions, the GOJ might also 
consider participating in a UN peacekeeping mission should 
one be deployed in the future.
