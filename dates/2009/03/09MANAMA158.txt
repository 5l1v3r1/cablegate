¶1.  The Bahrain Defense Force General Headquarters requests 
U.S. Government permission to demilitarize and dispose of 
three (3) TAH-1F Cobra Attack Helicopter airframes. 
 
¶2.    The aircraft arrived to Bahrain on 16 November 2004. 
The U.S. Army serial numbers for these airframes are: 
 
¶A.    76-22572 
¶B.    76-22607 
¶C.    76-22712 
 
¶3.    Many components and repair parts for this type of 
aircraft are no longer available for purchase and repairs are 
cost prohibitive.  All serviceable components have been 
removed from these aircraft for repair of other aircraft in 
Bahrain's fleet.  The remaining airframes are no longer 
useful. 
 
¶4.    Bahrain acquired and refurbished the three (3) TAH-1P 
helicopters under Foreign Military Sales case BA-B-UFX using 
national funds. 
 
¶5.    The original acquisition value of the aircraft is not 
specified in the Letter of Offer and Acceptance (LOA).  The 
BDF paid $300,000 for defense services to refurbish of each 
aircraft.  The airframes have no known remaining value other 
than scrap. 
 
¶6.    The Bahrain Defense Force is prepared to demilitarize 
the airframes in accordance with the instructions from 
Department of Defense Manual 4160.21-M-1, pages A4-33 through 
A4-34 and A7-44.  The demilitarization process will be 
observed by a member of the U.S. Office of Military 
Cooperation. 
 
¶7.    Bahrain would like to dispose of these aircraft as soon 
as possible, but not later than 31 July 2009. 
 
¶8.    Following demilitarization, the airframes will be sold 
as scrap metal with estimated proceeds of no more than $900 
each ($2700 total).
