SUBJECT: SOMALIA - TFG INTERIOR MINISTER SLIGHTLY WOUNDED 
IN MOGADISHU ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT 
 
¶1. (SBU) Recently-appointed Transitional Federal Government 
(TFG) Interior Minister Sheikh Abdikadir Ali Omar was 
slightly injured by the explosion of a roadside bomb or mine 
in an apparent assassination attempt as he was walking near 
Bakara market, Mogadishu, at about 9:30 (local) on March 26. 
One of Omar's assistants was killed in the attack and one of 
his bodyguards was wounded. No organization has to date 
claimed responsibility for the attack. 
¶2. (SBU) At a subsequent press conference, Omar refused to 
speculate on who might have perpetrated the attack, noting 
only that the attackers likely came from the ranks of those 
"opposed to peace." Omar urged Somalis to join the TFG's 
reconciliation effort.  TFG MP Osman Libah told us that he 
and other members of Parliament, as well as some of the 
leadership of Hisbul Islam expressed their solidarity with 
Omar after his press conference. Newly-appointed TFG 
Intelligence Chief Mohamed Sheikh told us in a separate 
telephone conversation from Mogadishu that he suspected that 
al-Shabaab was behind the attack on Omar.  (Note:  Al-Shabaab 
has promised to attack those who ally themselves with the 
TFG.) 
 
¶3. (SBU) Omar is a member of the Hawiye/Habr Gedr/Salebaan 
sub-clan and was Deputy Chairman of the Islamic Courts Union 
(ICU) when it seized control of Mogadishu in 2006.  He 
retains control of what is estimated to be the most powerful 
non-clan militia in Mogadishu. His "defection" to the TFG 
from the ranks of the ICU may have triggered the March 26 
assassination attempt. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The attempt on Omar follows two earlier roadside 
explosions targeting Somalis associated with the TFG.  On 
March 11, a roadside explosion killed General Ubayd Ali Fidow 
(Abgaal/Warsangeli) in Shibis District.  Fidow had worked as 
security chief for former Prime Minister Gedi.  No 
organization claimed responsibility for the attack.  On March 
15, Wadajir District Commissioner Ahmed Hassan "Dai" survived 
a roadside explosion as he was traveling in Mogadishu. 
"Dai's" driver and two bodyguards were reportedly killed. 
Al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for the attack on "Dai."
