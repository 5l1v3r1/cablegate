FUNDING 
 
REF: STATE 23811 
 
¶1. The European Commission has allocated 40 million euros for 
AMISOM support in 2008-2009 and is prepared to spend more if 
the African Union is able to absorb it, according to 
contacts.  Poloff delivered reftel points March 27 to 
Ragnheidur Roubineau, Somalia desk officer at the Council 
Secretariat, who said the European Union is willing to spend 
"significant amounts more" on AMISOM support this year. 
 
¶2.  The EU has been frustrated by the slow pace at which the 
African Union has been able to spend the money it has been 
given for peacekeeper salaries and establishment of a new 
force headquarters.  Of 20 million euros disbursed by the EU 
in 2008, only about a third has been spent, Roubineau said. 
Authority for some of that funding will expire in May and the 
AU might have to return unspent funds to the EU.  The EU 
allocated an additional 20 million euro in January 2009, but 
has not yet released it to the AU because of the 
still-unspent carryover from 2008.  The European Commission 
has 300 million euros in its newest African Peace Facility 
budget and could draw down an undetermined amount to support 
AMISOM. 
 
¶3.  On security sector reform, the EU continues to support 
police salaries and training through UNDP and would be 
willing to increase its support if the capacity to absorb 
more was evident, Roubineau said.
