(SBU) In a March 18 conversation with the MFA International 
Organization officers responsible for Security Council matters,

DPolCouns emphasized in particular that a public statement of 
support from Vietnam when the UNSC meets to discuss Somalia March 20 
would be particularly welcome.  MFA IO officer To Anh Tuan

MFA leadership and to his colleagues in New York.
