TAGS: PTER PARM ETRD KSTC XL HA DR CA
SUBJECT: CANADA TO SPONSOR UNSCR 1540 SEMINAR FOR CARICOM 
MEMBER STATES IN MAY 
 
REF: STATE 27289 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request for ISN/CPI -- see para 5. 
 
¶2.  (U) In response to reftel demarche, Department of Foreign 
Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) Senior Policy Officer 
David MacDuff expressed Canada's appreciation for the U.S. 
decision to provide both legislative drafting support and a 
regional coordinator to help CARICOM members states comply 
with UNSCR 1540 requirements.  For its part, MacDuff said, 
Canada plans to sponsor a seminar in May on the 
implementation of export controls and integration of the 
newly developed legislative and legal framework into CARICOM 
member state legal systems. 
 
¶3.  (U) According to MacDuff, the upcoming seminar will be 
billed as a follow-up to the February 2008 meeting of 
Caribbean states that the Washington-based Stimson Center, 
Canada, and other underwriters funded to encourage Caribbean 
states' buy-in to UNSCR 1540.  Canadian and Stimson Center 
officials expect to complete the seminar design soon, he 
added.  The next step will be to seek Canadian government 
approval for approximately USD 30,000 of the estimated USD 
50,000 cost of the seminar, with Stimson and other donors 
paying the rest, MacDuff noted. 
 
¶4.  (U) MacDuff commented that, according to the Italians, 
the Dominican Republic and Haiti have not yet complied with 
initial UNSCR 1540 reporting requirements.  Canadian and 
Stimson Center planners would need this "baseline 
information," he remarked, in order to design a useful 
seminar.  MacDuff asked whether the U.S. intends to take 
additional action to encourage the Dominican Republic and 
Haiti to complete their reports well in advance of the 
seminar.  Barbados, Jamaica, St Kitts and Nevis, and Trinidad 
and Tobago have completed their reports, he confirmed. 
 
¶5.  (U)  Action request:  please advise whether the USG 
intends to take additional, near-term action to urge the 
Dominican Republic and Haiti to complete outstanding UNSCR 
1540 reporting requirements, and whether the USG would be 
interested in conducting joint demarches with Canada.  Also, 
please advise whether we support/encourage the Canadian 
proposal to organize the upcoming seminar.
