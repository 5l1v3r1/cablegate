SUBJECT: EUROPEANS STEP UP WHA REGIONAL CLIMATE DIPLOMACY 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Europeans are lavishing greater attention on Costa 
Rica and other regional players with a view to shaping Latin 
America's engagement at the December 2009 Copenhagen negotiations on 
climate change.  Through a Feb. 23-24 visit, France's climate envoy 
signed a joint statement with Costa Rica's environment minister to 
stress French support for the GOCR's "National Climate Change 
Strategy."  In addition, as the UK and other EU members look for 
Costa Rica to play an influential role during the region's run-up to 
Copenhagen, they have stepped up their climate engagement to "help 
Latin America go to Copenhagen well prepared."  Regardless of any 
vehicle the USG might choose, such as Central America's emerging bid 
for a new "CONCAUSA III" process with the U.S. (septel), the EU has 
already started the race for regional influence on climate.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
France & Costa Rica Agree to Climate Cooperation 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶2.  (U) Brice Lalonde, France's chief climate change negotiator, 
visited Costa Rica Feb. 23-24, meeting with Costa Rican President 
Oscar Arias, Environment Minister Roberto Dobles, other government 
officials and private sector representatives.  On Feb. 24, Lalonde 
and Dobles signed a joint statement in which France committed to 
supporting Costa Rica's implementation of its "Peace with Nature" 
initiative and its "National Climate Change Strategy," both of which 
aim to make Costa Rica carbon neutral by 2021. 
 
¶3.  (U) Touting Costa Rica as an "environmental legend for 
biodiversity in the world," Lalonde said that Costa Rica would give 
France advice on natural resource management.  The agreement also 
reportedly provides for French assistance to Costa Rica on water, 
waste management, public transportation, energy efficiency, and 
geothermal development.  Looking ahead to the December 2009 climate 
negotiations in Copenhagen, Dobles suggested that Costa Rica could 
play a "catalytic role" in helping to bridge the "enormous 
differences" between the different blocs heading into the 
negotiations. 
 
Other EU Players Boost Climate Focus in the Region 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On Feb. 28, British Ambassador to Costa Rica, Tom Kennedy, 
told REO that climate change is the UK's key priority for Latin 
America.   He said that the UK has contributed USD 1 million to the 
UN Economic Commission for Latin America & the Caribbean (ECLAC) for 
preparation of "mini Stern reports" addressing the economic aspects 
of climate change for Mexico, Central America, and South America. 
(Note: Kennedy credited the UK's 2006 "Stern Review on the Economics 
of Climate Change" as having a "pivotal impact on the international 
climate debate."  End note.)  Kennedy added that UK embassies in the 
region, led by a nine-person team in their Mexico City embassy, are 
contributing to a regional climate change study.  In addition, he 
said that the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) has a campaign 
underway to get military authorities engaged on climate change 
issues.  They have begun by working to influence "military opinion 
leaders" in Mexico, Colombia, and Guatemala. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Kennedy noted that several EU members look for Costa Rica 
to play an influential role with other Latin Americans during the 
run-up to Copenhagen and that several EU members aim to help Latin 
America go to Copenhagen "well prepared."  Noting the French envoy's 
Feb. 23-24 visit, Kennedy suggested that France views Costa Rica as 
a "key entry point to the G77."  Along with the UK, he said that 
Germany and Spain appear to have stepped up their support for Costa 
Rica's implementation of its National Climate Change Strategy. 
Kennedy reasoned that Costa Rica's many years on the international 
stage, its various "centers of excellence" on environment, a strong 
NGO community, and the GOCR's "Peace With Nature" commitment to 
carbon neutrality put Costa Rica at the forefront of the region on 
climate.  He said that Costa Rica had hoped to host a regional 
meeting on climate change this month, but was preempted by an ECLAC 
climate meeting set for March 9 in Santiago.  Costa Rica may look to 
host a follow-on meeting mid-September 2009 which, Kennedy averred, 
could include EU invitees. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Kennedy continued, "everyone has noticed what President 
Obama is saying and doing on climate change."  He was gratified to 
learn of Secretary Clinton's & Special Envoy Todd Stern's recent 
visit to China, noting that "it would be a disaster for all of us if 
we don't come out of Copenhagen without the U.S. and China together 
on climate." 
 
 
COMMENT: "Game On" for Regional Influence on Climate 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶7.  (SBU) As evidenced by the French climate envoy's recent visit 
and increased attention that other Europeans are lavishing on the 
region on climate, the EU hopes to use its influence with Costa Rica 
and other regional "opinion leaders" such as Mexico in shaping Latin 
America's and the G77's engagement at Copenhagen.  In addition to 
U.S. engagement with the region's heavy hitters (e.g., Brazil and 
Mexico), the emerging Central American hope of strengthening climate 
ties with the U.S. through a new "CONCAUSA III" process (septel) 
could offer a vehicle to broaden the U.S profile and influence in 
Central America and the Caribbean.  Regardless of the vehicle we 
choose, the EU has already started the race for regional influence. 
END COMMENT.
