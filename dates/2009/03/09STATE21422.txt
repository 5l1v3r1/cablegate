SUBJECT: SUDAN: TALKING POINTS FOR MARCH 6 OCHA 
BRIEFING 
 
Â¶1.      USUN may draw from the following talking 
points 
for their March 6 briefing in the Security Council 
by 
Under Secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs 
John 
Holmes. 
 
Begin talking points: 
 
-- The United States condemns the decision by the 
Government of Sudan to expel from its borders 13 
foreign based NGOs and completely dissolve 3 local 
NGOs. Together these NGOs provide approximately 70% 
of the humanitarian aid being delivered in Darfur. 
 
-- The Government of Sudan's reckless decision has 
endangered 4.7 million of their own citizens and 
flouts numerous resolutions of this Council. 
Although thus far, these actions have only affected 
assistance to Darfur, we are deeply concerned about 
the possible impact they could have on the critical 
aid being provided 
throughout the rest of Sudan, especially the South 
and Three Areas.  These NGOs have decades of 
experience assisting the Sudanese people.  Their 
work keeps people alive, and their forced departure 
immediately and seriously threatens the lives and 
well-being of millions of people.  The United 
States fully supports their work and strongly backs 
their ability to continue their life-saving efforts 
unobstructed. 
 
-- Over the last two days the United States 
Government has reached out to the Government of 
Sudan in Khartoum, Washington, and New York to urge 
it to reconsider these expulsions.  I know the 
United Nations and many other concerned members 
states have reached out to the Government of Sudan 
as well.  Unfortunately, the Government of Sudan 
has chosen not to listen.  We call on all states, 
especially those in this body and others that have 
influence with top Sudanese officials, to press the 
GOS to reverse this decision. 
 
-- The UN and other humanitarian agencies that 
remain in Darfur are simply not capable of filling 
the void left by these NGOs, as they are already 
stretched to capacity. 
 
-- The international community must make it 
crystal-clear to the Sudanese government that it 
will be held 
accountable for the humanitarian consequences of 
its 
decision to expel these NGOS. 
 
-- Regarding an Article 16 deferral, the United 
States has made its position perfectly clear.  We 
do not support it. 
 
--These most recent actions of the GOS only worsen 
the situation. 
 
Questions for Holmes: 
 
-- Does the UN have contingency planning to meet 
the void left by the departing NGOs? 
-- What kind of programs will the UN not be able to 
replace due to the NGO expulsions?  Is there a 
system of prioritizing assistance? 
-- What kind of support will you need from the 
international community?  Do you have available 
emergency funding to cover expanded operations?  Do 
you need an emergency funding appeal? 
 
End talking points.
