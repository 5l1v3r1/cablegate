SUBJECT: South Asian Drug on Ontario Law Enforcement's Radar 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: Local authorities have begun to see an increasing 
number of cases involving doda, an opium-related drug popular in the 
local South Asian immigrant community.  The drug's relative low cost 
and easy availability (the drug is made from the same poppy flowers 
used by florists) have added to its popularity.  Although local 
authorities have been aware of doda for some time, a lack of 
information about the drug's content limited their actions.  Recent 
analysis released by Health Canada, however, indicates doda contains 
substances prohibited under Canada's Controlled Substance Act.  As a 
result of these findings, we are likely to see more publicity about 
doda and more doda-related arrests in the Greater Toronto Area 
(GTA).  End Summary.

CULTURALLY ENTRENCHED, DODA UNDER THE RADAR UNTIL RECENTLY 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Traditionally used in South Asian communities in the Toronto 
Area, Doda (sometimes spelled dode) is a powder made by grinding the 
husk and seeds of the poppy flower.  Doda is taken with tea or water 
and produces a quick high, followed by a sense of calm or 
well-being.  However, the drug can become addictive and, in large 
amounts can lead to an overdose.  Unlike khat, a comparable drug 
popular with East African and Middle Eastern users, doda retains its 
potency for several days and has a long shelf life.  Doda is mostly 
used by men in long-shift jobs such as truck drivers, taxi drivers, 
and factory workers, to help them stay awake. 
 
¶3. (U) Despite the drug's reported popularity in the GTA for several 
years, until recently, police have not been able to make arrests for 
doda use because there has been little information about the drug's 
content.  Prompted by a high-profile arrest in late 2008 when police 
seized more than 38 kilograms of doda with a street value of 
C$68,000, Health Canada analyzed the opiate content in doda.  Health 
Canada's analysis showed doda contains codeine and morphine, which 
are prohibited under Schedule I of Canada's Controlled Drugs and 
Substances Act.  The agency's findings have taken doda out of its 
previous legal grey area. (Note:  Under the U.S. Controlled 
Substances Act, the powder would be considered a Schedule II drug.) 
 
-------------------------------------------- 
CHEAP AND EASY TO FIND, POPULARITY IS INCREASING 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Doda powder is easily available for as little as C$1 per gram 
in flea markets, small grocery stores, and meat shops in South Asian 
neighborhoods.  Some users reportedly spend C$10-$40 per day on 
doda.  Some reports have indicated that the drug sellers rely on 
sources of poppy flowers imported from the U.S., as well as from 
other countries.  Arizona apparently is a prime U.S. source area, 
where the flower grows in the wild and is available through online 
retailers. 
 
¶5. (U) There is a growing concern that teenagers are mixing doda 
with other drugs, creating a volatile mix.  During his three years 
on the Brampton, Ontario city council, Vicky Dhillon, a member of 
the South Asian community, has been a long-time advocate of banning 
doda.  In his campaign against the drug, he refers to the damage he 
has seen the drug cause to his community, as well as the evidence 
that the drug is spreading to the local high schools. 
 
¶6. (U) Comment: At present, doda is most popular in the immigrant 
South Asian communities of Toronto.  Until recently it was readily 
available in corner shops throughout the GTA. However, a high 
profile arrest and Canadian government analysis have put a spotlight 
on the drug, but it is not yet clear how this recent attention has 
affected the availability of the drug.  With the new information 
about the narcotic content of doda, we expect to see and hear more 
about this drug and about doda-related arrests both within and 
outside the South Asian community.
