SUBJECT: REFUGEE FLOWS INTO YEMEN STRAIN AN ALREADY BURDENED SYSTEM 
 
¶1. (SBU/NF) SUMMARY: Pressing on an already overburdened system, the 
number of refugees in Yemen continued to increase in 2008. The ROYG 
is beginning to feel the increasing pressure from the existing 
population of refugees, along with these new arrivals, as evidenced 
by a draft law to end the policy of automatically granting refugee 
status to Somalis.  The draft law circulated among the ROYG, but 
failed to gain traction. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU/NF) 2008 saw a 70% increase in the number of migrant 
arrivals on the southern and western coasts of Yemen since 2007. 
According to UNHCR statistics, there were 50,091 new arrivals in 
¶2008. This is a significant increase over the 2007 figure of 29,360. 
 Among these new arrivals, there was a sharp increase in the number 
of Somalis, from 17,785 in 2007 to 33,019 in 2008, an increase of 
more than 85%.  Over the same period, non-Somali arrivals increased 
by almost 50%, from 11,575 to 17,072. 
 
¶3. (SBU/NF) The two main causes of the increase are continued 
instability in the Horn of Africa, especially Somalia, and migrants 
seeking economic opportunity.  UNHCR interviews migrants when they 
arrive at UNHCR reception centers near the coast and compiles the 
interviews into monthly reports.  Most migrants cite lack of 
security due to the on-going civil war in Somalia and lack of 
economic opportunity as their main reasons for making the trip. 
Many report they hope to use Yemen as a gateway into other Gulf and 
Middle Eastern countries in search of jobs and economic 
opportunity. 
 
¶4. (SBU/NF) At the end of 2008, there were 140,308 recognized 
refugees in Yemen.  Of those, 133,080 were Somalis, 4,594 were 
Iraqis, and the rest included small numbers of Ethiopians, 
Palestinians, and Eritreans.  (Note: Somalis are given automatic 
refugee status by the ROYG. End Note.) A majority of the refugees 
live in urban centers, especially Sanaa and Aden.  In the Kharaz 
refugee camp, located west of Aden, the number of residents has 
remained relatively steady since 2003.  At the end of 2008, there 
were 11,184 residents, of which 10,732 were Somali. 
 
¶5. (SBU/NF) UNHCR estimates that at least 140,000 unregistered 
migrants live in Yemen. The vast majority of the unrecognized 
migrants are Ethiopians.  Lacking any legal status in Yemen, these 
migrants are particularly vulnerable to exploitation.  The ROYG is 
often unwilling to allow UNHCR complete status determinations for 
these migrants, who often avoid local and UNHCR authorities, and 
attempt to reach larger urban centers where there are work 
opportunities and communities to support them.  The number of new 
Ethiopian arrivals processed in UNHCR reception centers increased 
from 21% in 2007 to 36% in 2008.  UNHCR attributes the increase to 
better outreach and resource allocation when meeting migrants 
arriving at the coast. 
 
¶6. (SBU/NF) The increase in refugees burdens Yemen's economy by 
adding workers to an already tight labor market.  This economic 
pressure led some in the ROYG to circulate a draft law ending the 
policy of automatically granting refugee status to Somalis.  While 
this draft law failed to gain traction in the ROYG, UNHCR reports 
that there are factions within the ROYG that wish to reduce the 
burden of refugees in Yemen.  (Note: Post has been unable to 
indentify the source of the draft law but continues to investigate. 
End Note.)  UNHCR continues to encourage the ROYG to adopt a 
national refugee law under the 1951 Convention Relating to the 
Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol to which Yemen is a 
signatory.  According to the UNHCR Representative in Yemen, Claire 
Bourgeois, the ROYG fears such a law will only increase the refugee 
flow.  UNHCR also reported the ROYG often limits or delays UNHCR 
access to non-Somali migrants. 
 
¶7. (SBU/NF) UNHCR aims to improve educational and economic 
opportunities, healthcare, and sanitation for refugees in the urban 
centers where current conditions are very difficult.  An added 
benefit of these programs is that they would also improve conditions 
for the local population, helping to entice the ROYG cooperation. 
Monitoring and reporting on these programs in urban centers is more 
viable given the current security situation in Yemen, which limits 
in country travel for many foreigners. 
 
¶8. COMMENT: (SBU/NF) In the unlikely event that the ROYG enacts 
legislation guaranteeing refugee rights under the 1951 Convention 
Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol, the 
automatic granting of refugee status to Somalis will end because the 
Convention and Protocol state refugee status determinations must 
normally be determined on an individual basis.  (Note: Group 
determinations can be made in cases of extreme urgency but this does 
not apply in the current situation with Somalis.  End Note.)  A 
comprehensive refugee law would also help with UNHCR's inconsistent 
access to non-Somali migrants to make refugee status determinations. 
 The prospects for such a law, though, seem unlikely at this time. 
END COMMENT.
