SUBJECT: GEORGIA ACTION REQUEST: SRSG VERBEKE NON-PAPER ON 
FUTURE UN PRESENCE 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY AND ACTION REQUEST. The UN Department of 
Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) has circulated a Non-Paper to 
the U.S. and other key stakeholders, which outlines basic 
principles for a security regime for Abkhazia, Georgia.  The 
Non-Paper also outlines elements of a future UN role in 
Georgia, to replace the UN Observer Mission in Georgia 
(UNOMIG), pending a broader agreement on a security regime. 
DPKO has asked for our views on the non-paper "in the coming 
days," in order to inform the thoughts of SRSG Johan Verbeke, 
who is currently engaged in a round of consultations in 
capitals of key stakeholders.  DPKO has told us that Verbeke 
will likely complete a first draft of his recommendations in 
mid-April.  USUN requests the Department to provide comments 
to the elements of the Non-Paper by March 31, 2009.  Text of 
the Non-Paper is contained in paragraph two. END SUMMARY AND 
ACTION REQUEST. 
 
¶2. (SBU) BEGIN TEXT OF NON-PAPER:

ground; (iii) the activities of the UN mission; and (iv) 
recommendations on "future activities".  The Council 
undertook to outline by 15 June "the elements of a future UN 
presence in the region", taking into account the 
recommendations in the report, the Geneva discussions and 
developments on the ground.
