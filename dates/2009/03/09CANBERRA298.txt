SUBJECT: SUBJECT: PAPER SCORE'S PM'S "SECRET" MEETING WITH 
CHINESE OFFICIAL 
 
Classified By: POLITICAL COUNSELOR JAMES F. COLE.  REASON: 1.4 (D) 
 
¶1.  (C/NF) SUMMARY: "The Australian" newspaper has criticized 
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's "secret" talks with Chinese 
Communist Party propaganda chief Li Changcum, on March 21. 
Officials in the Office of Prime Minister and Cabinet have 
told the Embassy that Rudd and Li discussed the need for 
coordinated action by the G-20 in dealing with the Global 
Economic Crisis and the Free Trade Agreement talks between 
the two.  However, the meeting is viewed by many in the 
context of China's plays for Australian resources, and Rudd's 
call for China to have greater influence in the IMF.  Li also 
met Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull, acting Governor 
General Marie Bashir and Australian press executives.  The 
Prime Minister's meeting with Li was routine - the public 
recognize China is a key trading partner - yet by excluding 
Australian media he has left himself open to questions and 
suspicions about his dealings with China, particularly in 
light of his subsequent strong advocacy for a greater role 
for Beijing in the IMF.  END SUMMARY. 
 
RUDD MEETS CHINESE PROPAGANDA CHIEF 
 
¶2. (U) The front page of the March 24 "The Australian" 
newspaper carried a headline: "Chinese walls: PM keeps 
Lodge talks secret," with photos of Rudd and the propaganda 
chief of the Chinese Communist Party, Li Chanchun.  The 
article reported that Chinese state-owned media but not 
Australian were invited to cover Rudd March 21 meeting with 
Li at the Prime Minister's residence in Canberra.  Less than 
24 hours later, Rudd declared he would push for China to be 
given a greater role at the IMF when he attends the G20 
summit next week. 
 
¶3.  (C/NF) Officials in the Office of Prime Minister and 
Cabinet told Pol on March 24 that Rudd and Li discussed the 
need for coordinated action by the G-20 in dealing with the 
Global Economic Crisis and the Free Trade Agreement talks 
between the two.  Chinalco's proposal for a greater stake in 
mining giant Rio Tinto was also undoubtedly on the agenda - 
PRC Embassy DCM Hong Liang told us last week that he was 
working on the visit of a "senior leader" and that Chinese 
investment in Australia would be an important topic.  The 
Prime Minister's office described the meeting as "private" 
and reportedly noted it was "not the Prime Minister of 
Australia's role to put out a press release announcing what 
every visiting politician is doing."  According to the 
Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) it received a tip 
that Li was arriving Friday night (March 20) on a flight from 
China. 
 
LI MEETS OPPOSITION LEADER TURNBULL 
 
¶4. (U) On March 23, Li and other Chinese officials met 
Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull in Sydney.  Addressing the 
media afterwards, Turnbull said they discussed climate 
change, Chinalco's proposal for a greater stake in mining 
giant Rio Tinto, and economic matters.  Like Rudd, Turnbull 
backed a greater role for China in the IMF, pointing out that 
this was a policy of the Howard government.  Likely referring 
to the Australian press being kept away from the PM's 
meeting, Turnbull noted that "It is always best for leaders 
to be open and transparent about their dealings with foreign 
government and leaders." Li also met with acting Governor 
General Marie Bashir and Australian press executives. 
RUDD MISREADS PRESS REACTION 
 
¶5. (C/NF) COMMENT: (SBU) COMMENT: Rudd,s handling of the 
public relations aspect of this senior official's visit is 
puzzling, if not inept.  The Prime Minister's meeting with Li 
Qpuzzling, if not inept.  The Prime Minister's meeting with Li 
was justifiable and defensible - the public recognize China 
is a key trading partner - yet by excluding Australian media 
he has left himself open to questions and suspicions about 
his dealings with China, particularly in light of his 
subsequent strong advocacy for a greater role for Beijing in 
the IMF.  Once the Chinese media filed their stories about 
the meeting, it was inevitable the Australian media would 
learn about it.  If the PM consented to a Chinese request to 
exclude Australian media from his official residence, it 
looks even worse for him, and only supplies fuel for those 
who claim he is too deferential to China. END COMMENT.
