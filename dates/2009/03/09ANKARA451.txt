SUBJECT: TURKEY: REQUEST REVISITING NSOI VISIT AFTER JUNE

REF: A. SECSTATE 24630 
     ¶B. SECSTATE 21170 
 
¶1. (SBU) We delivered the request for Nuclear Smuggling 
Outreach Initiative (NSOI) Coordinator Michael Stafford to 
visit Turkey soon to present for Turkish officials' 
consideration NSOI projects in the Caucasus and Central Asia 
(ref a).  Gun expressed appreciation for Mr. Stafford's offer 
to visit Ankara and said that it would be useful to have more 
information regarding these projects.  Given Turkey's 
commitment to co-host the 10th International EXBS conference 
(ref b) and a flurry of other activities for which his office 
is responsible in the near term, however, Gun requested to 
postpone discussion of Mr. Stafford's visit until after the 
EXBS conference (currently scheduled to take place week of 
June 22). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: We will follow up with the MFA at the 
earliest opportunity following the EXBS conference to request 
MFA support for Mr. Stafford's visit.
