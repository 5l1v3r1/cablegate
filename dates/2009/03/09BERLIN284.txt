HELMUT HOFMANN GMBH RESPONSES TO DTCC INQUIRIES 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶2.  (SBU) The reftel questions were answered by Stephan Mock, 
Purchasing Department - Helmut Hofmann GmbH. 
 
Begin text of responses: 
-- Can you confirm that the ammunition and firearms listed 
below were purchased for commercial resale in Germany only? 
RESPONSE: Yes, I can confirm that the ammunition and firearms 
are for resale in Germany only. 
 
-- Who are your regular customers and where do they reside? 
Our regular customers are dealers for hunting and sporting 
goods.  They are all based in Germany. 
 
-- What quantities of the items authorized on this license 
did Helmut Hofmann actually receive thus far? 
RESPONSE: All but a few remaining orders for rimfire .22 
ammunition.  Those will be shipped later this month. 
 
-- What are your annual sales of U.S.-origin firearms and 
ammunition? 
RESPONSE: Sales vary with market demand and U.S. dollar / 
euro exchange rate.  Ammunition sales can vary from 10 
million rounds (including affordable rimfire) up to 30 
million rounds.  Firearms vary as well with our 2008 numbers 
exceeding 1000 units sold. 
 
-- What quantity of firearms and ammunition did your company 
seek to import from the United States in 2008? 
RESPONSE:  This information is not immediately available.  In 
order to accurately check the orders to U.S. suppliers, this 
would take weeks of work. 
 
-- Can you explain the discrepancy, if any, between that 
which was authorized for export from the United States and 
that which the company actually sold in 2008? 
RESPONSE: Naturally, the difference will equate to the 
product that we imported in 2008 versus how much product will 
be sold in 2009.  That said, the 2008 product is sitting in 
our warehouse until we can sell it.  A large quantity of from 
our 2008 orders from a particular U.S. supplier is still on 
backorder and will ship at some point in 2009. 
 
--Are you familiar with the regulations governing the import 
of U.S.-origin defense articles, including restrictions on 
re-transfer or re-export? 
RESPONSE: Yes, we are familiar with the regulations governing 
the import of U.S.-origin defense articles.  Our last 
training seminar for the regulations was at in 2008 in 
Frankfurt.

COMMENT 
------- 
¶3. (SBU) Stephan Mock of Helmut Hofmann GmbH was very 
responsive to the reftel inquiries and indicated a 
willingness to address any follow-up questions.  Helmut 
Hofmann GmbH orders ammunition/firearms from U.S. suppliers 
based on their anticipated annual need.  Therefore, it is not 
abnormal for them to requested a greater amount of imported 
product than is sold in a given year.  Should they be left 
with excess (unsold) inventory, this would influence their 
request for import of ammunition/firearms for the following 
year.
