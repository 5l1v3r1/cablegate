¶1.  (U) Summary. This cable is the second in a monthly series 
recording significant counternarcotics activity in Afghanistan. 
Highlights include: 
 
- The Afghan National Police Poppy Eradication Force (PEF) and 
Afghan National Army Counter Narcotics Infantry Kandak (CNIK) 
eradicated about 27 hectares of poppy in three days of operations 
inside the Food Zone in Nad-e Ali district. PEF/CNIK received 
sporadic harassing fire from insurgents on all three days, with one 
CNIK soldier killed by RPG fire on March 3.  ISAF responded to enemy 
attacks twice during the week with artillery and once with 
air-to-surface missiles.  PEF/CNIK conducted eradication outside the 
Food Zone March 7-10. 
 
- Governor Led Eradication efforts (GLE) in Helmand province have 
eradicated 811 hectares while also facing stiff opposition from 
insurgent forces.  Total verified eradication (PEF and GLE) as of 
March 10 stands at nearly 3,000 ha. 
 
 
- The Afghan government arrested 3 low and mid-level narcotics 
traffickers, seized 902 kg of opium and destroyed 4 heroin labs. 
 
- For the time frame 19 Jan-20 Feb, the Criminal Justice Task Force 
(CJTF) started 30 case investigations involving 37 suspects while 65 
cases are in the prosecution stage. The Primary court convicted 26 
people on drug trafficking offences and acquitted 8. The Appeal 
Court convicted 51 people and acquitted 8. 
 
End Summary. 
 
ERADICATION AND RAIDS 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Helmand Operation: Repeated refusals to leave base camp by 
the ANA's Counter Narcotics Infantry Kandak (CNIK) crippled Food 
Zone operations, which are now suspended in favor of eradication in 
more secure areas.  At the PAG on March 12 with Defense Minister 
Wardak present, DCM Dell stressed the importance of supporting 
Helmand Governor Mangal and seconded the UK's request that Wardak 
order the CNIK to enter districts such as Nad Ali.   Dell praised 
Mangal's careful planning, noting Mangal deserved the support of all 
elements of his own government.  All parts of the government must 
work together to succeed in delivering governance at the local 
level, Dell said. 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Citing security concerns, the CNIK commander refused to 
take part in the first day of Food Zone operations, planned for 
February 22.  After ANA Chief of Staff General Bismullah Khan and 
DMOI Daud traveled to Helmand on February 23 to stiffen CNIK's 
resolve, PEF/CNIK conducted eradication in the Food Zone on February 
24, February 28, March 2, and March 3.  Harassing fire from 
insurgents occurred on three of four days, killing one CNIK soldier 
on March 3.  ISAF supported CNIK with artillery and missiles on 
February 24 and March 3.  Due to difficulty of movement, harassment 
by insurgents, and interspersing of poppy with other crops in small 
fields, PEF/CNIK averaged less than 10 hectares per day inside the 
Food Zone. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On March 4, the CNIK commander again declined to take the 
field, this time citing potential civilian casualties.  On March 6, 
Governor Mangal and the ANA 205th Corps Chief of Staff visited 
PEF/CNIK.  Mangal accepted that PEF/CNIK should eradicate outside 
the Food Zone for the time being, but stated his desire for PEF/CNIK 
to return to the Food Zone as soon as possible.  On March 7, 
PEF/CNIK began eradication operations outside the Food Zone in the 
area North-West of Babaji.  As of March 10, PEF/CNIK had eradicated 
more than 200 ha in this area (with no enemy contact). 
 
¶5. (SBU) In addition to the PEF operations, Governor Led Eradication 
efforts (GLE) in Helmand province have eradicated 811 hectares 
inside the Food Zone since mid-February, while also facing stiff 
opposition from insurgent forces.  Total verified eradication in 
Helmand (PEF and GLE) as of March 10 stands at nearly 2,929 ha.

SIGNIFICANT CN CASES 
 
¶10. (SBU) Mohammaed Gul.  Mohammed Gul's conviction for heroin 
trafficking was upheld in Appeals Court of the Counter Narcotics 
Tribunal in Kabul on February 28, 2009. Gul was a highway police 
officer in Kabul who assisted a large network of heroin dealers 
throughout the city. He was arrested along with eight associates in 
August 2008 with approximately 26 kgs of heroin. The arrests were 
the result of a complex undercover operation by SIU. The total 
amount of heroin seized was about 26 kg.  All nine defendants were 
convicted in Primary Court and sentenced to 16 years imprisonment. 
¶11. (SBU) Haji Abdullah Khostel.  Haji Khostel was indicted in Kabul 
with a trial date set for late March. He is suspected of 
masterminding one of the largest heroin production and trafficking 
operations in Afghanistan as well as collusion with the Taliban, who 
provided security for his activities. On February 5, 2009 the ASNF 
conducted several raids in Farah province (eastern Afghanistan) 
targeting Khostel's associates, relatives and drug processing 
facilities.  Khostel was subsequently arrested at Herat airport to 
prevent his escape from Afghanistan. He is suspected to be involved 
in the trafficking of more than 1700 kgs of heroin, 4100 kgs of 
opium and 2700 liters of precursors. 
¶12. (SBU) Muhammaeb Sayeed Silab, a former senior CNPA officer in 
Nimruz Province, was arrested on January 20 for his connection with 
the Haji Abdullah Khostel trafficking network that facilitated their 
activities both within Afghanistan and across the Afghan-Iranian 
border.  Saleb has attempted to obtain a reduced sentence by 
cooperating with CJTF prosecutors in accordance with Article 41 of 
the Counter Narcotics Law. Information he provided has led to the 
arrest and disruption of the Khostel network.  Silab's trial is 
expected to start in April.
