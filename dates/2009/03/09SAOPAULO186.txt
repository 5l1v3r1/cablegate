SUBJECT:  MEDIA REACTION - GLOBAL ECONOMY: FINANCIAL CRISIS; SAO 
PAULO; OBAMA TRIES TO AVOID NATIONALIZATION; DOUBTFUL SUCCESS OF 
PLAN TO CAPITALIZE BANKS IN U.S. 
 
Title- Obama tries to avoid nationalization 
 
Editorial in center-right Estado de S. Paulo (3-25) states: "The new 
plan to capitalize U.S. bank is President Obama's last attempt to 
solve the problem without having to resort to nationalization....For 
the government this is a high risk moment.  If it goes well, 
President Obama will have solved a huge problem without having to 
negotiate political support for nationalization.  If it goes badly, 
it will have compromised more money and will have wasted time and 
maybe he, who will then be politically weakened, will need to 
nationalize banks." 
 
Title- Doubtful success of plan to capitalize banks in U.S. 
 
Editorial in business oriented Valor Econtmico (3-25) says: "....The 
indirect path was taken [in the U.S.] to by-pass two problems.  The 
first, a real one, was to avoid having to ask Congress for a hundred 
billion more dollars that would be required if direct intervention, 
nationalization [of banks] or more capital injection was chosen. 
The second one, to avoid, under doubtful premises is for the State 
to evaluate those assets...there are good chances that this plan 
will not work.  One of the bad signs given by the government was its 
defensive attitude [in defense of the plan]."
