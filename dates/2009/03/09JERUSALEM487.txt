Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al Quds leads with March 18 statements by Palestinian Authority 
Premier advisor Hatim Abdul Qader revealing that the Jerusalem 
municipality had in the preceding 48 hours issued 80 demolition 
orders for 90 Palestinian residential flats in Jerusalem.  All 
papers run front page coverage of the news and add that the 
Municipality on March 18, demolished a Palestinian house in 
Azzariyah near Jerusalem.  Papers highlight that the owner had 
obtained the required building permit from the local village council 
that considers the house to be in Area B, as defined by the Oslo 
Accords. 
Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida lead with news that Palestinian 
factions have agreed to an, "interim, transitional national 
consensus government with a limited term that ends after 
accomplishing presidential and legislative elections and the 
formation of a new government."  The papers add that the factions 
did not agree on the political platform for the new government.  All 
papers report that the fate of internal Palestinian reconciliation 
dialogue depends on the outcome of talks in Washington between 
Egyptian intelligence chief Omar Sulayman and the U.S. 
administration.  Al Ayyam's front page reveals that Washington has 
told Sulayman that the U.S. will only recognize a Palestinian 
Authority government that accepts Quartet conditions and denounces 
violence.  The papers further report that Sulayman met with Special 
Envoy Mitchell in Washington. 
Al Ayyam's and Al Quds' front pages, also inside Al Hayat Al Jadida, 
feature a report on Israel's decision to "tighten" detention 
conditions for Hamas prisoners in Israeli prisons, in response to 
the failure of prisoner exchange talks with Hamas.  The papers 
further report that Israel moved detained Popular Front for the 
Liberation of Palestine leader Ahmad Sa'adat to Ashkelon prison, 
noting that the Israeli move is meant to diminish Sa'adat's 
influence as a leader.   In related news, Al Hayat Al Jadida and Al 
Quds front page statements by Hamas leader Salah Bardawil stating on 
March 18 that Israel is to blame for the failure of prisoner 
exchange talks and urges Egypt to publicly assign blame to one of 
the parties. 
Al Quds and Al Ayyam front page statements by Palestinian Authority 
President Abbas and Premier Fayyad following their separate meetings 
with Middle East Quartet Envoy Tony Blair in Ramallah on March 18. 
The Palestinian leaders reiterated their calls for a halt to Israeli 
settlement activities and incursions into the Palestinian 
Territories, stating that such action is key to rebuilding 
confidence in the peace process. 
 
All papers do inside reporting on increased tension in Bethlehem 
caused by the alleged attempt by Palestinian Authority (PA) National 
Security forces to arrest a Palestinian judge, chasing him into the 
courthouse.  The PA security forces denied targeting a judge and 
said that they were, "only tracking a citizen in an Israeli 
yellow-plated vehicle." 
Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida front page reports that Israeli 
Premier designate Netanyahu has invited the Kadima and Labor parties 
to coalition talks to form a new Israeli government.  The paper 
further adds that Netanyahu continues, in parallel, to form a 
"rightwing" government. 
 
An Al Quds' inside page reports on statements by USAID Director 
Howard Sumka, delivered on March 18 at the inauguration of a public 
park in Kufr Nima near Ramallah.  Sumka is quoted stating that the 
park is the first of 20 parks to be established in the West Bank in 
support of the Palestinian people.--------------

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
 
1)  Independent daily Al Quds' editorial is titled, "Diminishing 
chances for peace"(03/19):  "The chances for [regional] peace are 
diminishing against an increase in violence and calls for 
confrontation... [coupled with]irresponsible, possible 
miscalculations by Israel regarding the Iranian issue... a heavy 
responsibility is placed on the shoulders of the international 
community and new U.S. administration to intensify a positive, 
effective role in moving things towards... calm." 
 
 
2)  Omar Al Abdul Majid Swaylim comments in independent daily Al 
Ayyam under the title, "Dialogue Committees:  Initial 
harvest"(03/19):  "While it seems that [Palestinian reconciliation 
talks] have reached an internal truce [between Fatah and Hamas]... 
it is more important [to] reach a solution to the root of the 
problem.  Let's speed up, slowly, as the wise proverb says."
