SUBJECT: SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE HOLBROOKE AND KHALILI FOCUS 
ON ELECTIONS 
 
¶1. (SBU)  During a February 13 meeting, Special 
Representative Holbrooke and Vice President Khalili focused 
on upcoming Afghan presidential elections.  Khalili 
emphasized elections had to take place before the 
constitutionally mandated date of May 21 to avoid a crisis of 
legitimacy.  If President Karzai remained in office, he would 
be illegitimate, but if a third party became interim 
president, it could lead to a bigger crisis.  Holbrooke 
encouraged Khalili and his fellow leaders to find a pragmatic 
solution in order to prevent a political crisis on May 22. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Khalili noted according to the Constitution, the 
Speaker of the Upper House of Parliament should become the 
interim president if the president resigns.  He stated the 
United Front believed Upper House Speaker Mujadeddi was too 
old to be president. Khalili personally did not oppose 
Mujadeddi as an interim leader.  Khalili accepted the 
logistical and security difficulties of a spring election, 
but emphasized the government should be legitimate.  He 
argued that a delay in elections would make Karzai more 
powerful.  He did allow if all political parties and players 
agreed to August elections, he would also support the later 
date.  Khalili told Holbrooke that he did not intend to be a 
presidential candidate in this year's election, since 
Afghanistan was not yet ready for a Hazara Shi'a president. 
 
¶3. (U)  Ambassador Holbrooke's party cleared this message.
