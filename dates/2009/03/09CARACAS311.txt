Lina Ron is the leader of a small, pro-government party, "Unidad 
Popular Venezuela" (UPV), which has threatened and targeted members 
of the independent media and opposition leaders with political 
violence.  In January 2009, Ron personally led her party's attack on 
an opposition left-wing party, "Bandera Roja" (BR).  Ron and UPV 
militants forcibly removed BR and opposition leaders from a downtown 
Caracas auditorium, where BR members were celebrating the 
anniversary of the party's founding.  Credible open source reporting 
and Ron's public statements and actions support her inclusion in the 
Visas Viper program.

David Santana is the founder and leader of the "La Piedrita" 
collective, a small pro-government organization in eastern Caracas 
that frequently engages in domestic political violence.  During a 
recent newspaper interview, Santana claimed responsibility for tear 
gas bomb attacks and threats against members of the independent 
media, including the media conglomerate president Marcel Granier, 
the outspoken journalist Marta Colomina, and the independent cable 
station of Globovision.  Santana also claimed responsibility for 
attacks on opposition political parties such as Copei and the 
"Bandera Roja".  He said that "La Piedrita" was responsible for an 
attack on the Holy See mission to Venezuela as well.  Santana's 
public statements and violent actions provide credible evidence of 
his qualification for the Visas Viper program. 
 
¶4.  Visas Viper coordinator at post is Alyce Abdalla. Contact 
information is AbdallaAN@state.gov and 058-212-907-8254.
