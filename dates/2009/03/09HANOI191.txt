RESPONSE 
 
REF: STATE 19213 
 
(SBU) In a March 2 meeting with the MFA's Director General for 
International Organizations, Le Hoai Trung, CDA discussed the 
International Criminal Court's imminent indictment of Sudan 
President Omar al-Bashir and urged Vietnam not to support an Article 
16 deferral of prosecution.  She urged Vietnam to be muted in its 
response to the indictment, noting that the United States does not 
believe that a UNSC statement is necessary unless there is 
significant violence or Khartoum reacts in an extreme fashion.  DG 
Trung reiterated his government's strong opposition to the ICC 
indictment, but said that his government would take the U.S. 
position into consideration.  He said that its general disapproval 
notwithstanding, Hanoi had not yet drafted instructions to its UN 
Mission on how specifically to respond to an indictment.
