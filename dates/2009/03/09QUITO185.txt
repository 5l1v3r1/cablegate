SUBJECT: EMBASSY SCIENCE FELLOW (ECUADOR) 
 
¶1.  (U) Post seeks an Embassy Science Fellow (ESF) to assist USAID, 
USDA, and ECON with the development of projects for a viable 
biofuels sector in Ecuador.  The ESF will perform studies on the 
viability of certain crops for use in biofuel production from both 
agricultural and industrial standpoints.  Additionally, the ESF will 
perform studies on the environmental impact of developing a biofuels 
sector in Ecuador.  The ESF will work with GOE officials from the 
Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Renewable Energy, and 
its Office of Biofuels, as well as with scientists at universities 
such as the Escuela Politecnica del Ejercito (ESPE), private sector 
businesses, producer associations, and the Corporation for Energy 
Investigation.  The ESF will help establish more formal relations 
with similar research centers in the United States.  The ESF will 
also give lectures to an extended audience within the Ecuadorian 
business and scientific community.  This request has full country 
team support. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post proposes a stay of up to three months in Quito in the 
September-November time frame, with appropriate field visits.  USAID 
will provide office space, computer, and secretarial support.  FAS 
will provide funds for local housing and in-country travel expenses. 
 Post will provide additional support through program funds for 
email/internet access, health unit access, cashier services, and 
mail services.  Spanish speaking ability is strongly desirable and 
preferred.  A security clearance is not necessary. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Background: USAID/Ecuador has been assessing the 
possibility of establishing a commercial and technical cooperation 
package between the U.S. and private sector firms in the framework 
of the Summit of the Americas.  This topic was also discussed in the 
Bilateral Dialogue meeting with the GOE and is one of the 10 key 
strategic sectors that President Correa has given priority in the 
GOE's development plan.  As a first step, USAID will prepare a 
business and environmental assessment that will serve as the basis 
for requesting follow-up funding under initiatives to address global 
climate change currently being planned in USAID/W. The ESF will help 
prepare the request for a project follow-on activity, based on 
scientific and technical data that he/she will collect during the 
assignment in Ecuador. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post believes that ESF engagement with the Ecuadorian 
government, scientific, and business communities will help advance 
Ecuador's development priorities and is consistent with a number of 
mission objectives.  The effort will help foster economic growth and 
incomes, as well as promote environmental conservation and 
sustainable development.  With its focus on creating sources of 
clean and sustainable energy, the proposal supports USG efforts to 
prevent climate change by providing a low-carbon, low-sulfur fuel. 
The proposed partnership will promote a cost-effective biofuel 
alternative based strictly on market economics and environmental 
management, and encourage the maintenance of a sustainable natural 
resource base.  U.S. and Ecuadorian scientific institution cooperate 
in a range of specific activities, and the ESF should help expand 
that range of relationships.

Officer, BrustFE@state.gov, tel: (593)2-398-5219 and fax: (593)
