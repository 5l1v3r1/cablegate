¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to determine the 
legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, Roshydromet, Moscow, 
Russia. Roshydromet is the abbreviated name for the Federal Service 
for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring. The company is 
listed on BIS license applications: D389140 as the ultimate 
consignee of one Altix 4700 titanium 416 CPU blades w/2 dual core 
Montvale 1.67GHZ/18MB/667MHZ FSB sockets, 8 memory dim slots. ECCN 
4A003. The licensee is Silicon Graphics Inc., 1140 E. Arques Ave., 
M/S 50-1-554, Mountain View, CA 94043. 
 
¶3. On March 19, 2009, Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested post-shipment 
verification at the offices of Roshydromet, B. Perdtechensky per, 
9-11, Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with Vladimir 
Antsypovich, Director of the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology 
and Environmental Monitoring, and Sergey Lubov, Deputy Director. 
 
¶4. Vladimir Antsypovich is the Director at the main computer center 
within the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental 
Monitoring, the office responsible for the reftel commodity. 
 
¶5. Roshydromet was established 175 years ago as one of the first 
weather forecasting centers in the world.  Roshydromet is part of 
the Ministry of Natural Resources and employs 35,000 people 
throughout Russia. Roshydromet provides state authorities and the 
public with hydro meteorological information, including forecasting 
information and information on environmental pollution. In addition 
to weather forecasting, one of RoshydrometQs goals is to enhance the 
efficiency of business activities in weather dependent industries, 
e.g., aviation, marine and river transport, power industry and 
agriculture. 
 
¶6.  Roshydromet is one of three World Meteorological Centers (WMC), 
together with Washington, DC and Melbourne, Australia. The WMCs 
prepare global analysis products, short, medium and long range 
forecasts, and climate-related diagnostic products to member 
countries. 
 
¶7.  Vladimir Antsypovich took the export control team on a tour of 
the facility that houses the reftel commodity. From all 
observations, the facility meets the requirements outlined in reftel 
under the NDAA. The export control team was able to see the reftel 
commodity at its installed location; however, the system is not 
expected to be fully operational until May 2009. There were no 
indications of impropriety at Roshydromet and Vladimir Antsypovich 
answers were not evasive. 
 
¶8. Recommendations: Post recommends Roshydromet, Moscow, Russia, as 
a reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
