REF: JAKARTA 433 and previous 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary. The May 11-15 World Ocean Conference (WOC) and 
Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) Summit in Manado, Indonesia is an 
unparalleled "smart power" diplomacy opportunity.  We can showcase 
our environmental and climate change leadership on the road to 
Copenhagen and beyond.  We can strengthen our cooperation with 
Indonesia, a major greenhouse gas emitter and possible supporter of 
binding commitments for developing countries.  And, as the largest 
bilateral supporter of the Coral Triangle Initiative, we can 
demonstrate practical contributions to marine conservation. 
Secretary Clinton told President Yudhoyono that she would send a 
"high-level U.S. delegation" to the World Ocean Conference.  We 
request information on who will head that delegation.  End Summary. 
 
Major Economies Forum and Copenhagen: Advancing our Agenda 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
¶2. (SBU) High-level USG representation is essential to the WOC's 
success.  With the participation of at least seven heads of state, 
2,500 participants from over 100 countries, scientists, NGO 
representatives and worldwide media coverage, we can use the WOC to 
advance our policies on climate and the environment.  Our high-level 
participation will help to cultivate the Government of Indonesia's 
constructive engagement in the Major Economies Forum on Energy and 
Climate that President Obama has proposed.  We will accomplish this 
in part by signing a Manado Ocean Declaration that draws attention 
to the relationship between climate change and the ocean. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Indonesia, as a major developing country, can be 
particularly helpful in urging countries like China and India to be 
flexible and creative in seeking a global climate change agreement 
at Copenhagen.  During Secretary Clinton's visit, Indonesian 
officials told Special Envoy Todd Stern they welcomed U.S. 
leadership on climate change under President Obama.  They offered to 
help us in any way possible, including as an intermediary with 
countries like India and China.  Indonesia would certainly welcome a 
major speech on our climate policy from our head of delegation. 
 
Strengthening the U.S.-Indonesia Comprehensive Partnership 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
¶4. (SBU) Through high-level engagement and support for the WOC, we 
will advance our broader Comprehensive Partnership with Indonesia, a 
major economy and greenhouse gas emitter.  We are encouraging the 
participation of U.S. companies like Google and Mars, academic and 
scientific institutions and NGOs in the WOC and side events to 
advance that broader partnership.  During her visit, the Secretary 
discussed climate change cooperation and told President Yudhoyono 
that a senior-level USG official would participate in the WOC. 
Anything less would be disappointing to Indonesia. 
 
Real Environmental Leadership: The Coral Triangle Initiative 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
¶5. (SBU) Our support for the CTI, President Yudhoyono's initiative, 
is also important to Indonesia.  The first CTI Summit will take 
place during the WOC.  As a key CTI partner and the largest 
bilateral donor, we need to be represented at the highest possible 
level.  We can take this opportunity to demonstrate to Indonesia, 
the region and the rest of the world that we are making significant 
financial, technical and political commitments to address climate 
change and the world's environment.  The CTI is the first 
multilateral partnership of its kind, addressing the linkages 
between climate change, marine conservation, and food security.  The 
six CTI heads of state (Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Timor 
Leste, Papua New Guinea, and Solomon Islands) are planning to come, 
as well as Prime Minister Rudd from Australia, and the leaders of 
the Seychelles and Kiribas. 
 
¶6. (U) The CTI is also remarkable because it is the first time that 
three major non-governmental organizations (the World Wildlife Fund, 
Conservation International, and The Nature Conservancy) are working 
collaboratively on a major environmental program.  During the CTI 
Summit, the international heads of these organizations will meet 
together for the first time in their organizations' histories. 
 
We're Back: Getting the Message Out 
----------------------------------- 
¶7. (SBU) The WOC presents a timely and strategic public diplomacy 
opportunity for us to reinforce the message that the U.S. is ready 
to take leadership on climate change.  Any messages delivered by USG 
representatives during this week will be heard throughout Indonesia 
and the region, for a start, and across the globe if we get our 
delegation right.  We expect the Indonesian press and some of the 
 
JAKARTA 00000539  002 OF 002 
 
 
Jakarta-based international correspondents to provide coverage of 
the WOC and CTI Summit from Manado.  Two Chinese news agencies have 
registered with the organizers, and more foreign press will do so 
over the coming weeks. 
 
¶8. (U) The GOI has warmly welcomed substantive U.S. contributions to 
the WOC program.  This includes a proposed keynote address by Dr. 
Nancy Knowlton, the Sant Chair in Marine Science at the 
Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History, whose trip is 
being coordinated by our Public Affairs Section.  The organizers 
have also invited National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) Administrator Dr. Jane Lubchenco to give the keynote address 
for World Ocean Policy Day on May 13.  They would welcome any 
additional contributions by senior USG officials and policymakers. 
 
¶9. (SBU) We continue to urge the highest-level USG delegation 
possible (including senior officials from State, USAID and 
Commerce/NOAA).  Meanwhile, the Embassy will continue to lay the 
groundwork for this delegation's success in advancing our bilateral 
and international goals through the WOC and CTI Summit.
