SUBJECT: SOMALIA - BOSSASO CLERIC'S SUPPORTERS PROTEST ARREST 
 
SUMMARY 
-------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On March 24, violent protests erupted in Puntland's port 
city of Bossaso as police and Puntland Intelligence Service (PIS) 
officers arrested Osman Mohamed Shire, a prominent local cleric. 
Puntland residents told us that PIS targeted the cleric for his 
public statements in support of a recent Osama bin Laden video on 
Somalia, and on suspicion that he has links with al-Shabaab in 
Kismayo, which he has visited frequently.  The arrest sparked a 
violent protest as youth threw stones at security officers and lit 
fires on the main road.  The protests temporarily stopped all 
traffic and businesses along the main highway.  The media and 
Embassy contacts report that three persons were killed, a PIS 
officer in a vehicle accident, and two protestors.  Prominent imams 
objected to the way in which Shire was treated while being detained. 
 They urged residents to refrain from any violent acts and at 
present, Bossaso remains calm.  End summary. 
 
Preacher Arrested, 
Violence Ensued 
----------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On March 24, violent protests erupted in Puntland's port 
city of Bossaso as police and the Puntland Intelligence Service 
(PIS) arrested Osman Mohamed Shire, a prominent local cleric known 
for his efforts to generate street support for his causes.  Several 
sources in Bossaso confirmed to Somalia Unit that Shire was 
preaching to crowds along the highway from a car fitted with a 
public address system when PIS officers detained him.  The crowd 
violently confronted the PIS officers in an attempt to prevent them 
from taking Shire away. Angry youths threw stones and other objects 
at the security officers.  The confrontation drew additional crowds 
and protestors burned tires and blocked the road with boulders. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Maryan Ahmed, a Bossaso-based educator and activist for 
women's rights told us the PIS had been following Shire for several 
months for his suspected links with al-Shabaab. Shire reportedly 
visited Kismayo on numerous occasions after al-Shabaab took over, 
Ahmed said.  Shire gained support for numerous fundraisers he 
conducted in Bossaso to build mosques and support orphans and enjoys 
a wide following, especially among youth. Ahmed suspects that it was 
these travels, Shire's regular preaching, and sermons supporting the 
recent Bin Laden video on Somalia which provoked his arrest. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) According to one of our partners in Bossaso, at the time 
of Shire's arrest a helicopter was seen flying over the area, 
causing increased tensions and further escalating the protests. 
Others alleged to us that unknown gunman fired at security officials 
from the rooftop of an adjacent hotel.  PIS officers reportedly 
fired into the air to disperse the crowd.  Two protesters were 
reportedly wounded and later died of their injuries.  The third 
reported death was that of a PIS officer who was killed when he fell 
from his vehicle and was run over by another PIS vehicle while 
leaving the protest. 
 
Calm Restored 
------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) In the wake of the disturbance, several prominent imams 
urged Bossaso residents to remain calm.  These imams criticized the 
manner in which the PIS arrested the cleric, although they did not 
publicly question the decision to arrest Shire.  In a media 
interview, Abdullahi Said Samatar, Puntland Minister of Security, 
termed the violent reaction of Bossaso youth deplorable and insisted 
that the security forces have the right to arrest anyone for 
security reasons.  Samatar announced that President Farole had 
appointed a high level committee, including the Ministers of 
Security and Interior, to investigate the incident and elucidate the 
circumstances surrounding the violence.  "We will correct our 
actions if investigations reveal misconduct on the part of our 
security forces," said Samatar. In the interim, he urged members of 
the public to work in partnership with the security forces and avoid 
antagonizing each other. At present, the situation in Bossaso 
remains calm.

------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Security formed one of President Farole's election 
campaign platforms and this incident is evidence that his 
administration is willing to use a strong hand, if it deems it 
necessary. The October 29 suicide bombings and an evident 
fundamentalist Islamist presence have convinced the Puntland 
Administration that it must act aggressively to counter any 
potentially disruptive influence. It is also significant that the 
Minister of Security voluntarily opened an investigation and is 
willing to take corrective action, if warranted.
