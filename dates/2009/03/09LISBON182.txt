(SBU) Portuguese MFA interlocutors were grateful to receive 
the reftel white paper, which they said was a great 
assistance for their preparations for both the Afghanistan 
meeting in the Hague and the upcoming NATO Summit.  They were 
not prepared to respond to the paper in a detailed manner, 
but noted Foreign Minister Amado's recent statements 
regarding the need for NATO to reemphasize the Atlantic 
region.
