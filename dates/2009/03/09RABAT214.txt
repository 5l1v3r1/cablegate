¶1.  This message provides requested updates for the 
Department of Labor's annual report on the Worst 
Forms of Child Labor in the Western Sahara. (Ref A) 
The sovereignty of the Western Sahara is disputed 
between the Government of Morocco and the Polisario, 
an Algerian-backed organization seeking 
independence.  The GOM maintains control over a 
significant portion of the Western Sahara from the 
coastal areas inward.  The GOM considers the 
Western Sahara to be an integral part of its 
national territory and applies the same laws and 
administrative procedures that exist in the rest of 
the country.  Post has submitted a report detailing 
the overall situation of forced labor and child 
labor in Morocco (Ref B). 
 
¶2. Economic activity in the Western Sahara is 
limited to phosphate mining, pastoral nomadism, and 
fishing.  There is very limited industrial activity. 
Emboffs visit the region frequently and Post is not 
aware of any significant instances of forced labor 
or child labor in the Western Sahara.  Traditional 
Sahrawi practices of domestic slavery were 
eliminated many years ago.  The only reports we have 
heard of about slavery stem from allegations that 
the practice continues in Polisario-controlled 
refugee camps.  Child and labor issues are also 
addressed in the Western Sahara Chapter of the 
annual Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 
(Ref C). 
 
¶3.  This message was prepared by Consulate 
Casablanca Laboff Matthew Lehrfeld, and represents 
coordinated Mission views. Further inquiries should 
be directed to Consulate Casablanca, info Rabat.
