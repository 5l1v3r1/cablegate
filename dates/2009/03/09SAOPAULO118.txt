"Time to wait" 
 
Editorial in liberal A Folha de S. Paulo (3-2) says: "Each day there 
is less probability that Israel forms a coalition 
government....Without Kadima's support, Likud is left with the 
option of leading a more radical and nationalist government, leaning 
towards the opposition to any substantial concession to the 
Palestinians and the peace process...Either way, on the Israeli side 
as on the Palestinian side, the new political scene will be 
determined by the concrete results from the political distension 
with Iran launched by new US President, Barack Obama." 
 
"Obama's budget" 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (3-2) states: 
"....United States President, Barack Obama, began to fulfill his 
campaign promises when he presented the main points of his budget 
proposal for the fiscal year 2010.....Obama's explicit commitment is 
to reduce the U.S. deficit in the upcoming years..... During his 
campaign, Obama did not make any commitment to open the American 
market more and to contribute to the trade liberalization....Obama 
will have to negotiate his first budget in an environment filled 
with a lot of pessimism."
