Cuba's new cabinet 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (3-4) states: 
"....Fidel's brother, 77 years old Raul Castro, leaves clear his 
intention of being surrounded by people of his strict confidence in 
order to consolidate his hegemony - without waiting for the 
commander [Fidel Castro] to pass away. Military nominations lead one 
to think that Raul, Cuba's Defense Minister for decades, wants to 
have members of the institution he knows best and controls - the 
Armed Forces - close to him. What for? Only time will tell...." 
 
Obama listens to lobbies 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (3-4) states: 
"President Barack Obama may be able complicate the conclusion of 
global trade negotiations - the Doha Round - and also block the 
liberalization of international trade. These are the most important 
signs of the first manifestation of his administration's foreign 
trade policy. The United States Trade Representative Office (USTR) 
annual report, the first one produced by the Obama administration, 
justifies the fears of a more protectionist U.S. policy and a more 
sensible one to lobbies that defend subsidies and barriers....The 
inclusion of 'social and environmental' objectives in the Doha Round 
may seriously complicate negotiations .....President Luiz Inacio 
Lula da Silva has at least one serious topic to talk to Obama this 
month in the United States".
