SUBJECT: CHP CONTROL OF EDIRNE THREATENED IN MAYORAL 
REMATCH 
 
1 (U) Incumbent Edirne Mayor Hamdi Sedefci of the Republican 
People's Party (CHP) faces a tough rematch at the polls on 
March 29 from Justice and Development Party (AKP) candidate 
Mustafa Hatipler.  Sedefci barely defeated Hatipler in the 
2004 local contest; winning by less than 1,000 votes out of 
82,000 cast. A close contest in the last election, combined 
with a four month stint in jail in 2008 on corruption 
charges, threatens to make this rematch an even tougher race 
for the incumbent Sedefci. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Sedefci told us the 2004 campaign was more 
challenging because he lacked a sizable staff in the previous 
election as he did not run as an incumbent.  He claimed his 
proven track record of providing services to the city will 
help him to victory, predicting a strong turnout for CHP. He 
explained that his election strategy in the last two months 
has included reaching out to nearly 5,000 more "trustworthy" 
women and children through tea party meetings.  Sedefci 
assured us the corruption charges against him were baseless, 
driven by a vengeful police chief.  Sedefci contended the 
baseless charges came only four months after he had been 
jailed.  He cited human rights concerns for having been 
jailed without charge, claiming the police arrested him first 
and then searched for evidence.  He declined to provide his 
thoughts on the Ergenekenon indictment, noting that the room 
was bugged.  He has been out of jail for about nine months, 
but he told us his next court appearance will be on April 10 
after the election. 
 
¶3. (SBU) In contrast, our meeting with AKP candidate Hatipler 
centered on policy issues, such as improving Edirne's 
infrastructure and creating more opportunities for college 
bound students. Hatiplar contended Sedefci's greatest 
challenge will be overcoming his failure to attract 
investment to the city, especially in light of the economic 
crisis. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Edirne -- a former capital of the Ottoman Empire -- 
is literally at the crossroads to the European Union, 
bordering both Greece and Bulgaria. Edirne's 130,000 
residents resemble the diversity of the region, home to a 
synagogue until 1970 and two Bulgarian churches. Also the 
Roma compose 30 percent of Edirne's population, according to 
Deputy Governor Aydin Akkor.  Edirne's electorate has 
historically alternated between electing CHP or center-right 
Motherland Party (ANAP) mayors over the past six elections. 
In the 2007 general election AKP did relatively poorly in 
Edirne; receiving only 21 percent of the vote, compared to 47 
percent nationwide. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  With polling data unavailable, it is 
unclear whether the corruption charges against Sedefci will 
make the difference this time around. Both pro-government and 
opposition media have portrayed Sedefci as the culprit, yet 
Sedefci's self portrayal as the victim of a political witch 
hunt might resonate with voters. If Hatipler does prevail on 
March 29, then AKP would have a powerful symbolic victory in 
this historic and diverse city.
