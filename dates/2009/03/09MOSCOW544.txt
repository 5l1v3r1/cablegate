SUBJECT: RUSSIA SYMPATHIZES WITH PROPOSED MORATORIUM ON 
PROSECUTION OF SUDANESE PRESIDENT 
 
¶1.  The Russian government has criticized the ICC's issuance 
of an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Bashir, which the 
GOR contends could negatively impact the chances for reaching 
a peaceful settlement to the conflict in Darfur.  According 
to a MFA statement, Russia "understands" the position of the 
African Union, Arab League, Organization of the Islamic 
Conference, and the Non-Aligned Movement, which have called 
for the UNSC to suspend prosecution of the Sudanese President 
for one year under Article 16 of the Rome Statute.  The GOR 
has not indicated whether this means it will actually support 
a potential UNSCR to defer prosecution.  Russia also called 
upon the Sudanese leadership to continue the search for a 
negotiated solution to the problem of Darfur, in 
collaboration with the UN, African Union and other mediators. 
 
 
¶2.  Mikhail Margelov, the Russian President's recently 
appointed Special Representative for Sudan and Chairman of 
the Federation Council's International Affairs Committee, 
criticized the ICC for selectively issuing an arrest warrant 
for Bashir.  Margelov told Interfax that the ICC action 
threatened dire consequences for Sudan and the prosecution 
should be deferred.  Stating that all those guilty of crimes 
in Sudan should be held accountable, regardless of their 
position, Margelov declared that by charging only Bashir with 
crimes against humanity, the ICC had created skepticism of 
its impartiality.  In a commentary written for the daily 
newspaper Kommersant, Margelov criticized the ICC for 
intending to arrest the "leader of only one belligerent 
party" when the rebels fighting the Sudanese government were 
guilty of robbery, rape, torture and abduction.  Instead of 
pursuing Bashir's arrest and prosecution, Margelov called 
upon the international community to support the agreement 
signed February 18 by the Sudanese government and the rebel 
group the Movement for Justice and Equality, which offered a 
step toward a comprehensive peace settlement. 
 
¶3. Interfax reported that a source within the MFA warned that 
the ICC arrest warrant "could destabilize" the situation in 
Sudan.  Speaking with Echo Moskvy radio via telephone from 
Khartoum, a representative of the Russian Embassy said the 
ICC decision was a "mistake."  He stressed that Russian 
citizens living in Sudan should not fear for their safety in 
the event of public protests against the ICC decision because 
Russia enjoyed "good relations" with the country.
