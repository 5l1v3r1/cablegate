BOARD MEETING 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Iraqi Ambassador Aqrawi told Ambassador Schulte on 
June 8 that Baghdad had instructed him earlier in the day to 
seek an Agenda item at the June 15-19 Board of Governors 
meeting on Iraqi compliance.  Aqrawi shared that Board Chair 
Feroukhi discouraged a new agenda item at this late stage but 
suggested raising the issue under the Agenda Item "Any Other 
Business" (AOB).  Aqrawi sought guidance from Ambassador 
Schulte on how to proceed.  Aqrawi told Ambassador Schulte 
that he had not yet approached the Secretariat. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Action Request: Mission requests immediate guidance 
on whether to encourage Ambassador Aqrawi to raise the issue 
of Iraq compliance under AOB.  Iraq could request the 
Secretariat prepare a paper on Iraq's cooperation and 
compliance with its safeguards agreement for the September 
Board of Governors meeting.  Mission appreciates knowing how 
this fits into our broader commitment in helping Iraq lift 
Chapter VII restrictions.
