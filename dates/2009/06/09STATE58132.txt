conducting a pre-license check on application 050172197 for

requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days.

appeared on previous licenses but the companies' bona fides 
have not been verified by a Blue Lantern check. 
 
¶4. ACTION ISLAMABAD:  Post is requested to make inquiries 
with appropriate GOP officials to determine if the PMOD 
ordered the thermal camera systems from AERO and if so, 
verify the amount, and that the items will be used for the 
purpose stated on the license.  PM/DTCC also requests that 
post conducts a site visit to AERO in order to provide 
Department with an assessment of its business operations and 
on-site security.  Finally, post is asked to assess whether 
the company appears to be a reliable recipient of USML items. 
 If a site visit is not possible, please inform the PM/DTCC 
officer. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
(For AERO) 
 
--Does the company have supporting documentation for this 
proposed transaction? 
 
--Does the company have secure facilities and proper 
accounting and security procedures for handling sensitive 
USML items? 
 
--What is the exact end-use for this USML item? 
 
--What is the nature of the company and when was it 
established?  Who are its principals? 
 
--What type of organizations are among its typical customers 
and where are the customers located? 
 
--Does the company understand the restrictions on United 
States Munitions List (USML) items, especially the 
prohibition against unauthorized re-transfer and re-export?

officials in order to establish the bona fides of this
