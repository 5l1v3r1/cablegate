CLASSIFIED BY: Elizabeth Kauffman, Acting Consul General. REASON: 1.4 (b), (d) 

Â¶1. (S/NF) On 6/3/2009, Acting CG chaired a meeting of the EAC to discuss the increased threat stemming from the release of Jammat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed from house arrest in Pakistan. Regional Affairs in New Delhi has seen credible intelligence suggesting there are multiple threads of terrorist planning ongoing in India, some of which are possibly tied to Saeed's release.  The EAC discussed the warden message issued by New Delhi and agreed to enact SMS messaging to notify Consulate staff and family members. The EAC also agreed to activate the ACS warden message system for all registered American citizens. The Consulate also issued a Management Notice advising staff to register  with ACS to ensure full distribution of future warden messages. In attendance at the EAC were representatives from CONS, ECON, MGT, POL, PAS, and RSO.
