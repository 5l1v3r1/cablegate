SUBJECT: UPPER HOUSE SPEAKER MOJADDEDI PRESSING KARZAI FOR 
SUBSTANTIVE PLEDGE IN EXCHANGE FOR SUPPORT 
 
¶1. During Ambassador Eickenberry's June 9 courtesy call, 
Upper House Speaker Mojaddedi conceded President Karzai was 
the only viable presidential candidate but had many flaws. 
Neither Abdullah Abdullah nor Ashraf Ghani have the 
personality or capacity to govern, Mojaddedi claimed. 
However, Mojadeddi has told Karzai he would only support the 
latter's presidential bid if Karzai made a contract with the 
people to take certain actions and not repeat past mistakes. 
Mojaddedi has asked for a written committment to this pledge. 
 Karzai has not yet delivered, but recently told Mojaddedi he 
was preparing the document. 
 
¶2. President Obama's speech greatly impressed Mojadeddi, and 
he has sent Obama a letter thanking him for his support.  The 
Upper House MPs present also approved of the speech. 
Mojaddedi's aide declared that any Afghans have read the 
speech, as media outlets had widely disseminated the speech 
in Dari (most likely sourced from distribution by Embassy 
Kabul's public affairs section). 
 
¶3. Recently returned from an eight-hour spinal surgery in 
Turkey, Mojadeddi appeared weak, but said he was not in pain. 
 "I am too old and sick to do a proper job for the country. 
However, I am trying and still can influence others in the 
right direction."
