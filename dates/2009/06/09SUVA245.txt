SUBJECT: AMBASSADOR LUNCHES WITH TAIWAN'S TRADE MISSION 
REPRESENTATIVE 
 
¶1.  On June 4, I met with Victor Chin, Taiwan's Trade Mission 
Representative, for an informal luncheon to discuss Taiwan's goals 
in the region.  Chin assured me that Taiwan was honoring its pledge 
to withhold any direct payments to Fiji's de facto PM Bainimarama. 
Chin recalled that immediately after the 2006 coup, the United 
States requested Taipei to stop its grassroots payments amounting to 
USD million to Fiji's prime minister's office.  Although these 
payments had been given to former PM Qarase, Chin said Bainimarama 
was calling on a weekly basis asking to resume the payments.  Chin 
added that Taipei decided to curtail grassroots payments to Pacific 
politicians even before its current apparent truce with Beijing on 
checkbook diplomacy.  He noted that Beijing was honoring its 
agreement not to pursue efforts to get Kiribati, Tuvalu, Nauru and 
Solomon Islands to switch allegiances.  However, there was no local 
engagement between his office and the PRC embassy. 
 
¶2.  Chin said that recent trade missions by Taiwanese businessmen to 
Fiji were organized by Fiji's representative in Taipei.  The Fijian 
government, Chin reported, is keen on finding foreign investors to 
take over some of the cash short resort properties.  Thus far there 
have been no takers.  Chin observed that the local Chinese community 
has not been adversely affected by the economic downturn because it 
is engaged in local exports, particularly fisheries, food products 
and mahogany, which are sold mostly to mainland China.   He said 
that Taipei would continue its agricultural development projects at 
the village level. 
 
COMMENT 
----------------- 
 
¶3.  It is a bit ironic that Fiji is seeking Taiwanese investment in 
the tourism sector while at the same time seeking PRC tourists. 
Fiji last year relaxed entry requirements for Chinese visitors and 
received Beijing's designation as an approved tourist destination.
