REF: A. JAKARTA 1065 
     ¶B. JAKARTA 891 AND PREVIOUS 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  SUMMARY:  In a June 22 meeting with Defense 
Minister Sudarsono, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for 
South and Southeast Asia Robert Scher underscored the 
positive developments in the military relationship and 
applauded Indonesia's progress on defense reform.  DASD Scher 
offered U.S. air transportation assistance for Indonesia and 
urged speedy completion of negotiations for the C-12 
Memorandum of Understanding, NAMRU-2 and the Defense 
Cooperation Agreement.  Minister Sudarsono concurred with 
these priorities and expressed an interest in the U.S. 
strategic reviews underway, such as the Quadrennial Defense 
Review. END SUMMARY. 
 
IMPROVE COOPERATION ON AIR SAFETY 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On June 22, DASD Scher underscored to Minister 
Sudarsono that assisting Indonesia with its air 
transportation is a high priority for the USG and Secretary 
Gates in particular.  DASD Scher offered assistance with 
maintenance programs for Indonesia's existing fleet of 
C-130s.  In addition, he said the United States will work to 
find C-130 H models available for Indonesia in coming years. 
Minister Sudarsono said that in 2010, Indonesia would 
consider focusing its budget for refurbishing C-130s on the 
newer H type aircraft.  Minister Sudarsono agreed that the 
Indonesian Air Force could benefit from a smaller C-130 fleet 
with a higher number of flight-ready aircraft. 
 
CONCLUDE OUTSTANDING AGREEMENTS 
 
¶3.  (SBU) DASD Scher urged the Minister to conclude 
negotiations of a number of outstanding agreements.  On the 
C-12, Minister Sudarsono expressed the Indonesian military 
preference to return to the basis for the previous MOU, in 
which the C-12 supported exclusively military assistance 
programs.  Minister Sudarsono expressed a willingness to be 
flexible on this point, however, in relation to disaster 
response.  DASD Scher also emphasized the importance of 
finding a positive resolution to NAMRU-2 questions soon. 
(Note: In a separate development reported in ref A, on June 
23 the GOI accepted a way forward on NAMRU.) 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Minister Sudarsono reinforced the Indonesian desire 
to wait until a Comprehensive Partnership document is signed 
before completing a Defense Cooperation Agreement.  DASD 
Scher urged the Indonesian government to resolve outstanding 
questions on the Defense Cooperation Agreement quickly. 
 
EMPHASIZE GLOBAL PARTNERSHIPS 
 
¶5.  (SBU) DASD Scher commended Indonesia's contributions to 
peacekeeping, including recently hosting the Garuda Shield 
Global Peacekeeping Operations Initiative (GPOI) Capstone 
Exercise.  He emphasized the importance the United States 
places on working with key partners to address shared global 
issues, and noted the value of peacekeeping as one such 
example.  Minister Sudarsono expressed a strong interest in 
the U.S. strategic reviews underway, such as the Quadrennial 
Defense Review and others. 
 
¶6.  DASD Scher approved this message.
