¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: One of Russia's two representatives to the 
International Whaling Commission (IWC) told Post that Russia fully 
supports U.S. positions for the upcoming IWC meeting in Madeira. 
Specifically, the government of Russia (GOR) favors continuing the 
"Future of the IWC" process to reach a consensus package, 
restricting NGO and other outside participation to an observer role, 
and limiting the number of countries involved in IWC meetings.  The 
delegation has not yet decided whom to support for the positions of 
IWC Chair and Vice-Chair.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU)On June 5, Vasiliy Titushkin of the MFA Legal Department, 
one of Russia's two representatives to the IWC, told Post's 
Environment Specialist that Russia fully agrees with U.S. positions 
for the upcoming IWC meeting.  Russia's second commissioner, 
Valentin Ilyashenko of the Ministry of Natural Resources and 
Ecology, is already in Madeira for the IWC meeting and could not be 
reached for comment.  Titushkin did not yet know whether he would 
attend the meeting. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Titushkin said that the GOR favors continuing the "Future 
of the IWC" discussions with the aim of achieving a consensus 
package.  He added that if a other IWC members can agree on a 
compromise solution, Russia will not block it.  Russia supports 
continuing the IWC's work, especially its role in preserving 
aboriginal subsistence whaling. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Titushkin noted that Russia favors limiting the role of 
NGOs and other outside observers in IWC meetings.  The IWC should 
remain an intergovernmental organization, he said, in accordance 
with its original purpose.  He said that some NGOs have actively 
interfered in the decision-making process and have tried to force 
their opinions upon governments.  However, he said, Russia is not 
opposed to an observer role for NGOs, as long as it does not involve 
active participation. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Russia favors limiting the number of countries that 
participate in IWC discussions.  Titushkin commented that, as a 
rule, decisions should be made by a smaller working group of the 
most influential countries and those with a vested interest in a 
given discussion.  Wider participation greatly increases the 
complexity of the process. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Russia still has no favored candidates for the positions of 
IWC Chair and Vice-Chair.  Titushkin explained that the Russian 
delegation will decide at the meeting whom to support based upon the 
results of discussions.
