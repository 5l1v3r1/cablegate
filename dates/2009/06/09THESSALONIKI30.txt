CYBER-CRIME, OTHER TRANSNATIONAL THREATS

¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  Post's fourth annual regional seminar on 
Trans-border Law Enforcement Cooperation, which focused this 
year on Cyber crime, confirmed strong regional interest in 
tackling Balkan transnational crime.  Police and prosecutors 
from Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, 
Macedonia and Turkey received training in cyber-forensics from 
U.S.-based experts working for the Department of Commerce and 
Department of Justice.  Coinciding with the announcement of 
President Obama's cyber-security initiative, the seminar 
underscored the importance the USG attaches to the topic and our 
commitment to confronting it through international cooperation. 
Such seminars encourage a collective approach to fighting 
transnational crime and contribute to regional cooperation and 
stability.  The seminar also highlighted Greece's potential to 
play a leadership role in fighting Balkan transnational crime, 
with support from the USG.  END SUMMARY 
EIGHT BALKAN COUNTRIES AND U.S. COOPERATE ON CYBER-CRIME 
--------------------------------------------- ----------- 
 
¶2.  (U) Police and prosecutors from Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, 
Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, Macedonia and Turkey participated in 
ConGen Thessaloniki's fourth annual training seminar on 
trans-border cooperation in the northern Greek border town of 
Drama June 1-4, 2009, with a special focus on cyber-crime.  The 
primary aims of the seminar were 1. to build capacity of 
participants to investigate and prosecute crime through the use 
of cyber forensics and  2.  to promote practical cooperation 
among police and prosecutors from neighboring southeast European 
countries. 
 
¶3.  (U) Experts from the U.S. Department of Justice and 
Department of Commerce provided instruction in cyber forensic 
investigative skills.  This included the use of computers and 
information technology to investigate a wide variety of crimes 
that at some point in their planning or execution involved the 
use of computers or related devices such as smart phones. 
(e.g. credit card fraud, bank fraud, identity theft, robbery, 
child pornography, rape, kidnapping, murder and terrorism).  The 
seminar focused on hands-on training on techniques, review of 
recent success stories and how cross-border cooperation 
contributed to success, best practices in investigation and 
prevention.   The seminar took place in a classroom-type setting 
with audiovisual equipment and a laptop for each participant. 
This was the fourth consecutive year Post has organized a 
regional seminar on trans-border cooperation, with previous 
topics including trafficking in persons, narcotics trafficking, 
illegal immigration and weapons smuggling.   As in previous 
years, the Department of Justice provided funding to cover the 
cost of participants' transportation, lodging and per diem 
during the seminar. 
 
SEMINAR CONCLUSIONS 
------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The quality and engagement of participants indicated a 
high level of concern about cyber-crime and an interest in 
working regionally to address it.  The USG's credibility, 
resources and organizational capacity were critical factors in 
bringing together police and prosecutors from eight southeast 
European countries for joint training.  Such regional seminars 
encourage a collective approach to fighting transnational crime 
and contribute to regional cooperation and stability.  Other 
Post conclusions from the seminar follow: 
 
-- Fighting cyber-crime is a high priority for SEE countries and 
a topic on which the USG can strengthen bilateral relations and 
regional cooperation.  Participating countries sent experienced 
police officials and prosecutors who remained engaged throughout 
the seminar and afterwards requested additional USG training on 
cyber-crime and cyber-forensics.   There appear to be some 
differences in the level of cyber-forensics capability between 
participating countries, though most have established special 
cyber-crime police units and all seem to appreciate the need for 
a coordinated law enforcement response to cyber-crime. 
 
-- Training police and prosecutors together in the same seminar

was productive, but judges also need training.  Participating 
police and prosecutors readily admitted they need more training 
and that they need to work more closely together (domestically 
and internationally), but insisted that successful prosecution 
of cyber-crime depended on training judges too.  Participants 
said judges need separate, basic training (tailored to judges) 
in cyber-crime and cyber-forensics to help them get up to speed. 
 
-- The seminar helped foster regional cooperation at the 
operational level.  During parts of the seminar that emphasized 
cross-border dialogue and cooperation, participants exchanged 
information freely and refrained from the political posturing 
and bickering (e.g. between Macedonian and Greek officials) that 
has flared up occasionally at previous seminars. 
 
-- USG-provided training in trans-border cooperation and 
cyber-crime has promoted goodwill towards the USG.  National and 
local media provided comprehensive and positive coverage of the 
opening reception as well as closing press conference.  The 
seminar generated good public relations for the USG, since most 
Greeks recognize cyber-crime as a potential threat to them and 
accept the training as "win-win". 
 
-- Greece should be encouraged to play a leadership role in 
strengthening regional law enforcement cooperation, including on 
cyber-crime.  Greece has technical capabilities and experience 
to organize future training seminars with U.S. support as 
needed.  In the past few weeks, the Greek police electronic 
crime squad has helped dismantle a Greek-Macedonian-Bulgarian 
credit card fraud ring, a Bulgarian-Greek ATM/credit card fraud 
ring and an internet child porn ring based in Greece. 
 
SUGGESTED NEXT STEPS 
-------------------- 
¶5.  (SBU) Post recommends (if funds are available) co-organizing 
a follow-up regional seminar in 2010 on cyber-forensics and 
cyber crime (or illegal immigration or another transnational 
threat of mutual interest) with the Greek Police at its new 
Police Training Academy in the northern Greece border town of 
Verria.  Athens Legatt, DHS/ICE rep, and CG Thessaloniki 
visited the newly completed training facility in February, 
during which the chief of northern Greece police, General 
Bamiatsis, expressed a strong interest in hosting regional 
seminars that would include U.S. instructors.  Bamiatsis's 
successor, General Apostolides, reiterated the offer to Post on 
June 16.  Apostolides added that the academy hosted its first 
regional training seminar (on the handling of hostage 
situations), with the participation of police from Greece, 
Turkey, Bulgaria, Romania and Albania.  (Note:  A U.S. 
co-organizing role in future seminars might help secure 
participation of Macedonia and other Balkan countries.  End 
note) 
 
¶6.  (U) Post would like to thank Embassy Athens Office of the 
Legal Attache, SECI, the Department of Justice and Department of 
Commerece for invaluable support in the organization of the 
seminar.  Post also thanks Embassies Tirana, Sofia, Ankara, 
Podgorica, Belgrade, Skopje and Bucharest for their assistance 
in identifying and vetting excellent participants for the 
seminar.
