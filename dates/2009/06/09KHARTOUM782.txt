SUBJECT: KHARTOUM EAC RECONVENES ON JUNE 23 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  A/CDA Asquino reconvened the Emergency Action 
Committee (EAC) on Wednesday, June 23, to evaluate the most recent 
threat information regarding the anticipated June 24 announcement of 
verdicts in the Granville/Abbas terrorist murder case.  The EAC also 
discussed a commitment from the Sudanese National Intelligence and 
Security Service (NISS) to provide additional security for Embassy 
facilities and residences connected with this announcement and the 
June 19 killing of an alleged extremist, Obaid Abdel Wahab.  A/CDA, 
POL, RSO, DLO, MGT, CONS, USAID, PAO, IMO, GSO, HRO, RAO, and LEGAT 
Cairo were in attendance. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The EAC was briefed that there was no indication of any 
specific threats to US or Western interests, but that NISS was 
concerned about anti-regime rhetoric preached in several mosques on 
Friday, June 19.  The latter resulted from the killing of University 
of Khartoum professor, and alleged extremist, Obaid Abdel Wahab. 
NISS informed EmbOffs that they are taking such threats very 
seriously, and have made plans to increase uniformed and 
plain-clothed security at the US and British Embassies, in addition 
to GoS security installations.  In addition, NISS instituted 
heightened security measures for the June 24 Granville/Abbas trial 
verdict announcement that included posting additional security 
around the courthouse and its surrounding environs. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) After reviewing Post's existing security protocols, the 
EAC agreed to the following additional measures: 
 
- Only Mission-critical staff will be required to report for work at 
the Chancery on June 24.  OBO/NEC personnel are considered to be 
Mission-critical.  All USAID Mission personnel in Khartoum will work 
from home. 
 
- Those reporting for work at official facilities in Khartoum should 
stagger their schedules and use motorpool transportation.  No 
vehicles will be allowed to park outside the Chancery after 11:00 
a.m. on June 24. 
 
- The weekly radio check will be conducted on Wednesday instead of 
Thursday morning.  Mission personnel must continue to carry their 
radios with them at all times.  Any imminent danger information will 
be disseminated via the Embassy E&R radio network.  The verdict 
announcement will be sent to Embassy staff from the RSO via SMS text 
message. 
 
- The EAC also agreed that American personnel should stay off the 
roads in Khartoum between 12:00 Noon and 6:00 P.M. on Friday, June 
26 due to NISS' concern for continued anti-regime/anti-Western 
rhetoric during this Friday's sermons. 
 
- A core EAC will reconvene on Thursday, June 25, to review public 
reaction to the verdict announcement and possible threat-related 
information. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) A Mission Security Notice and Consular Warden Message were 
distributed after the EAC advising the Mission employees and 
American Citizens of the additional security precautions and 
potential for violence.  Post remains on high alert and will 
immediately report any new developments via septel.
