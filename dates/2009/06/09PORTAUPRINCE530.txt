WAGE BILL

Classified By: Ambassador Janet A. Sanderson for Reasons 1.4 (a, d) 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Students from two faculties of the State 
University of Haiti (Universite d'Etat Haiti/UEH) faced off 
with police the afternoon of June 3 during a student-led 
protest to pressure the government to increase the minimum 
wage.  Students pelted vehicles and businesses with rocks and 
bottles, resulting in property damage to nearby enterprises, 
including a local NGO -- FOKAL, formerly headed by the Prime 
Minister. Riot police, armed with teargas, responded 
forcefully to quell the unrest and sought to protect FOKAL 
premises which appeared specifically targeted.  Students vow 
to continue their protests until the minimum wage bill is 
promulgated.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Violence broke out June 3 during a protest by 
approximately seventy students from the State University's 
(UEH) Faculty of Human Sciences (FASCH) and the Institute of 
Administration, Management and International Studies 
(INAGHEI) who accused President Preval of defending the 
''interests of the bourgeoisie'' against the interests of 
workers.  Haitian Police (HNP) representatives reported to 
the RSO that neither students nor police was directly 
injured.  The press reported June 4 that two students 
suffered leg injuries while fleeing the dispersion of tear 
gas. Seven students were arrested and later released. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The HNP reported that one car window and a window at 
the FOKAL office located near the site of the protest was 
broken.  Some reports indicate that FOKAL, an NGO that 
promotes cultural arts and was previously directed by Prime 
Minister Pierre-Louis, may have been intentionally targeted 
by students to express their anger at Preval and Pierre-Louis 
over the delay in promulgating the minimum wage law.  HNP 
deployed riot control (CIMO) and special weapons teams (UDMO) 
to the area in a show of force to quell the violence and 
later dispatched a CIMO team to guard the FOKAL office. The 
students promised to continue protests until Preval signs the 
minimum wage bill that would raise minimum daily wages from 
70 Haitian gourdes (HTG) to 200 HTG, equivalent to USD 1.75 
and USD 5.00, respectively. 
 
¶4. (C) Pierre-Louis told Ambassador June 3 that she believes 
the attack on FOKAL was politically inspired and her friends, 
including the current FOKAL Director, report she was badly 
shaken by the incident.  Palace Secretary General Fritz 
Longchamps said the Palace worried that a ''racist element'' 
emerged during the attack and was troubled about slogans 
characterizing Pierre-Louis as ''a blanc'' (white person), a 
term sometimes used derogatorily against lighter-skinned 
Haitians to characterize them as ''impure.'' 
 
¶5. (C) Preval appears between a rock and a hard place on the 
minimum wage issue.  He and Pierre-Louis discussed the impact 
of the increase with private sector representatives on May 6. 
 He said he would sign the bill into law, but would request 
Parliament to delay the effective date until October.  Preval 
added that his hands were tied and there was nothing he could 
do to otherwise change the law (Reftel).  Some factory owners 
have criticized the planned increase in the minimum wage, 
stating that the scale of the increase took many of them by 
surprise.  Preval met again with private sector 
representatives on June 3.  He will meet June 5 with 
representatives from both Chambers and attempt to devise a 
compromise to gradually phase in the wage bill. 
 
¶6. (C) Preval appears to now be convinced that the steep 
increase in wages proposed in the bill will have a 
detrimental impact on investment, exports and current 
employment. (Comment:  The Senate approved the wage law on 
May 5, shortly before the end of the first session of 
Parliament.  According to the Haitian Constitution, Preval is 
not obliged to sign or propose modifications to a law while 
the Parliament is in recess.  Instead, the Parliament is 
supposed to resend the law to the President at the opening of 
the next session on June 8, although it is unclear what will 
happen if it does not.  End comment) 
 
¶7. (SBU) In light of the recent violent protest by students, 
Preval may face greater pressure to move quickly to sign the 
bill into law.  (Note: The RSO is monitoring reports that 
students are currently engaging with police and CIMO officers 
in the downtown areas of Champs de Mars and Avenue 
Christophe.  Embassy will report septel any other pertinent 
developments as the situation evolves. End note)
