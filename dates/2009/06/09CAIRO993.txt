(S) We have informed the relevant Egyptian government authorities of the UNSC actions against three North Korean entities, shared the associated non-paper, and urged the necessary actions to be taken (ref A). To date there is no response. We will follow up and report back if we learn of any action that is taken. In addition, Treasury Under Secretary Levey was in Cairo on May 17 and asked Deputy Governor Hisham Ramez about the three entities.
