(SBU) In response to reftel, Econoff delivered the demarche 
to Susannah Gordon, Acting Deputy Direction for the South 
Asia division at the New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and Trade (MFAT). Gordon informed us that New Zealand will 
provide a contribution of NZ$1.0 million in assistance to 
Pakistan from the New Zealand Agency for International 
Development's 2009/2010 humanitarian budget.  MFAT wishes to 
advise that the exact mechanism for delivery of this 
assistance will be resolved shortly so that assistance can be 
provided as soon as possible beginning after 1 July 2009. 
The Ministry further noted that New Zealand continues to 
review its policy engagement with and on Pakistan, and that 
the Ministry would welcome continued dialogue with the United 
States of America on regional security issues, particularly 
with reference to Afghanistan and Pakistan.
