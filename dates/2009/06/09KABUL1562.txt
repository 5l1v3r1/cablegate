SUBJECT: SUPPORTERS QUESTION JALALI ON HIS FUTURE 
 
REF: KABUL 1194 
 
¶1. (SBU)  Former presidential candidate Ali Ahmad Jalali has 
told supporters he intends to sit out the rest of the 
campaign and not publicly endorse any other candidate.  He 
hinted his acceptance of the conventional wisdom that 
President Karzai had amassed an impressive collection of 
endorsements from the country's political elite and enjoyed a 
clear advantage over his other rivals.  Jalali told several 
hundred supporters in a June 16 public speech that he would 
return to Afghanistan after the election to establish a 
reformist political movement or party, possibly in 
conjunction with other currently unaligned political figures. 
 Jalali explained to his supporters that he decided not to 
register his candidacy after efforts to reach power-sharing 
agreements with other major candidates fell through (reftel). 
 
¶2. (U)  During his speech to supporters, Jalali outlined his 
vision for a political movement and called for government 
decentralization and reforms in the rule of law and security 
sectors.  Jalali promised to "restore citizens' trust in our 
government" by demanding greater accountability from public 
figures and improving local security. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Former Jalali campaign manager and Lower House MP 
Gen. Helal Helaludin told PolOff on June 16 that Jalali had 
returned to Kabul this past week to re-connect with 
supporters who were confused over his sudden departure from 
the campaign.  Jalali has not instructed followers to support 
any other campaign.  Helal believed Karzai had offered Jalali 
various government positions in exchange for his support 
during at least three separate meetings during Jalali's 
visit.  Jalali declined Karzai's offers, but did not 
completely rule out a future role in the administration.
