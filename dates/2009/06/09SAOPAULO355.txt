Title- Violence in Iran 
 
Main editorial in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (6-22) says: "....The 
presidential run [in Iran] made explicit and intensified the 
polarization....between the emerging groups aligned to Ahmadinejad 
and the moderated piece of the traditional leadership...that 
converged as Mousavi's party .... The massive popular 
dissatisfaction in Iran is a new variable... [The country] has 
changed in the last 30 years....The antiquated Iranian autocracy 
seems in disaccord with the nation that is emerging.  In this 
divorce, State violence rises as the last recourse - a recipe for 
tragedy." 
 
Title- Domestic Front 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (6-22) states: "The contrast 
with regards to global warming could not be larger [in comparison] 
with George W. Bush's negatives.  The scientific report released by 
Barack Obama's White House brings the term 'unequivocal' in its 
first sentence about global warming..... The U.S. is moving; 
nonetheless, [but] only on the domestic front.  The rest of the 
world is waiting for this change to translate into commitments to 
begin international negotiations on climate."
