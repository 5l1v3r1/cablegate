SUBJECT: PM FAYYAD RESPONDS TO NETANYAHU'S SPEECH 
 
REF: JERUSALEM 1005 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: At a June 17 meeting of donors, 
Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad responded 
to Israeli PM Netanyahu's June 14 speech.  He acknowledged 
the mention of a Palestinian state, but commented that the 
speech as a whole describes a policy that will not lead to a 
successful peace process.  Fayyad he emphasized the 
importance of implementation, not just recognition, of 
previous agreements.  End summary. 
 
 
Fayyad: A "good step," but "Don't park it there too long" 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) Fayyad used a June 17 meeting of the donor community 
to respond to PM Netanyahu's June 14 speech.  Fayyad said he 
understood why some governments characterized Netanyahu's 
reference to a Palestinian state as a "good step."  However, 
Fayyad said, the international community "can't park it there 
for too long."  He said that the speech encompassed a range 
of issues which, taken in totality, will not lead to an 
outcome consistent with international law. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Fayyad characterized Netanyahu's speech as reverting 
back to "an earlier Israeli narrative regarding the root 
causes of this conflict."  Netanyahu's words echoed themes 
heard before the peace process began, before Madrid, and 
before Oslo.  And now, he said, 16 years later, "that 
narrative has returned."  Fayyad noted that there was no 
mention of ending the occupation or of stopping incursions 
into Palestinian-controlled areas, but there were references 
to "Judea and Samaria" and a historical claim to the land. 
He acknowledged that the Palestinian reaction had been 
emotional, but he reminded donors that in 2002, then-PM 
Sharon delivered a speech saying he looked forward to working 
to achieve the vision of two states, side by side in peace 
and security.  Fayyad called that speech "imperfect" but 
stronger than Netanyahu's.  He asked: "If that earlier 
formulation didn't work, where will we go from this weak 
start?  If this is the new beginning, you can see why it is 
viewed with the utmost concern." 
 
Focus on Implementation 
----------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Fayyad said the few vague references in the speech 
to international agreements addressed recognition, not 
implementation.  He said Netanyahu intentionally did not 
refer to the Roadmap.  For Palestinians, the speech did not 
seem like a step forward, but rather a recipe for endless 
discussion and delay. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Fayyad said the speech as a whole made clear that 
"it will not produce the Palestinian state that Netanyahu - 
at long last - mentioned."  Rather, it seemed that Netanyahu 
views Palestine "as an entity, a security protectorate of the 
State of Israel."  He noted that Netanyahu continued to defy 
the international community, particularly regarding 
settlements.  He also noted that Netanyahu called for talks 
without prior conditions, but his speech was "replete with 
conditionalities." 
 
¶6. (SBU) Fayyad said that Palestinian anger at the speech was 
largely a result of its "pedagogical" tone, highlighting 
Netanyahu's call for Palestinians to come forward and "show 
courage."  He said that, in his view, "the ability to take a 
strong stance in the face of political pressure is the best 
measure of honesty, integrity, and conviction."  He said 
Netanyahu should be courageous and follow up on commitments 
made by the State of Israel, rather than shying away from 
them and capitulating to political pressure.  He encouraged 
the international community to remain focused on actions and 
implementation, not just talk. 
 
A Commitment to Negotiations 
----------------------------- 
 
¶7. (SBU) Fayyad closed by saying he wanted to restate the 
Palestinian position clearly:  "We remain firmly committed to 
a just and durable peace...willing to negotiate and 
compromise to establish a viable, sovereign state, with East 
Jerusalem as its capital."  He asked for the international 
community to take the actions needed with Israel to further 
 
JERUSALEM 00001031  002 OF 002 
 
 
this vision, including: a freeze on settlements, an end to 
incursions in Palestinian areas, and implementation of the 
2005 Agreement on Movement and Access.  He cautioned that 
there will be an erosion of Palestinian faith in the process 
if it slides too far from previous agreements.
