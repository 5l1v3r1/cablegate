¶1. (SBU) Summary:  The Japanese are interested in cooperating with 
the U.S. and Australia in providing assistance to the Royal 
Government of Cambodia (RGC) to strengthen maritime security under 
the Trilateral Counterterrorism Consultations/Trilateral Strategic 
Dialogue.  Japan has played a constructive role in promoting 
maritime security with other regional actors, and its interest in 
engaging with the RGC may bring additional resources and expertise 
to complement U.S. and Australian efforts.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Representatives from Office of Defense Cooperation (ODC), 
Defense Attach's Office, EXBS Regional Office, and Pol/Econ section 
met with officials from the Japanese Embassy in Phnom Penh June 23 
to discuss cooperation on maritime security issues.  Enhancing 
Cambodia's maritime security domain is a priority for the Mission 
(Reftel).  Japanese First Secretary Masaki Kawaguchi explained that 
the RGC recently requested Japanese assistance in supporting the 
Cambodian maritime security initiative. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Despite Kawaguchi's initial concerns that Japan's direct 
assistance to the Cambodian military may be constrained for policy 
reasons, he was pleased to report that his government is eager to 
engage with the RGC on this issue.  He explained that the Japanese 
government plans to support maritime security under the framework of 
the Trilateral Counterterrorism Consultations/Trilateral Strategic 
Dialogue (TSD).  Kawaguchi and his colleague have also approached 
the Australian Embassy to discuss providing this assistance under 
the aegis of the TSD.  Kawaguchi said that the GOJ plans to host the 
next TSD in Tokyo, tentatively in October, and would seek to include 
among the topics for discussion cooperation with the RGC on maritime 
security. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment:  Given Japan's experience in promoting maritime 
security and safety in the region, its willingness to join the U.S. 
and Australia in the effort to strengthen Cambodian maritime 
security is a welcome development.  ODC plans to invite the Japanese 
to join the maritime security initiative technical working group 
workshop planned for early September to assist the RGC develop the 
roles and responsibilities of departments of the newly-created 
National Committee on Maritime Security.
