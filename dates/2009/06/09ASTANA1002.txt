SPEECH 
 
ASTANA 00001002  001.2 OF 002 
 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY:  President Obama's Cairo speech has received 
overwhelmingly positive press coverage in Kazakhstan.  Official 
"Khabar TV" broadcast President Nazarbayev's welcoming comments 
about the speech, and daily "Liter" published an in-depth, 
analytical story on the address.  The overall coverage has been 
light, due mainly to timing: the speech was delivered late Thursday 
afternoon, which missed the deadlines for the Thursday-Friday weekly 
analytical newspapers.  However, several Internet news sites 
reported positively on the speech.    END SUMMARY. 
 
PRESIDENTIAL IMPRIMATUR 
 
¶2.  Several media outlets, including the government-owned flagship 
station "Khabar TV," reported President Nazarbayev's reaction to the 
Cairo speech.  Nazarbayev said he was "inspired by this constructive 
approach from the U.S. President, and for its part, Kazakhstan is 
ready to keep strengthening the political, cultural, and economic 
cooperation between the two countries.  There is a vast difference 
between leaders of states who rely on fear and violence and 
thoughtful leaders who are ready to contribute to building a safe, 
free, and prosperous world.  In his speech, Barack Obama made it 
clear that he understands this difference very well, and I 
enthusiastically accept his appeal to work together."  In a private 
meeting, Foreign Minister Marat Tazhin told Ambassador Hoagland that 
it was "one of the best speeches ever and deserves to be published 
in 'Speeches that Changed the World.'"  Adding that he thought the 
candor and intelligence of the speech were unparalleled, Tazhin said 
he sincerely hoped President Obama would be successful in his new 
opening to the Muslim world-"not for the sake of the United States, 
but for the sake of the whole world." 
 
DENYING THE DENIERS 
 
¶3.  Pro-government, Russian-language "Liter" published the most 
serious analysis of the speech that has appeared so far.  The author 
said that the U.S. President admitted that there was "an abyss of 
misunderstanding" between the Islamic world and Western countries. 
Before Obama's visit to Egypt, the author noted, the White House 
made it clear that one of the aims of the visit was to present a new 
image of the United States to the Islamic world.  But Obama also 
unexpectedly stated, "It is my task to change the negative 
stereotypes of Islam that have resulted from the fight against 
terrorism."  The author said that "Obama's attention to the problem 
of Holocaust denial was another surprise" and pointed out that "this 
was a hint for Iran and its wordy politicians."  Though this point 
might have been "a sweet treat for Israel," the author thinks that 
"one of the requirements for renewing the diplomatic relationship 
between the United States and Iran will be Iran's acceptance of the 
Holocaust." 
 
¶4.  "As promised," continued the author, "the United States has 
abandoned the idea of reforming the world according to its own 
standards.  Now the United States is aiming at renewing historic 
justice."  Calling Obama's Middle East policy "equidistant," the 
author said that the United States "will not turn its back on 
Palestinians who deserve to have a decent life on their own 
territory."  The author concluded that nothing new was said about 
Iran's nuclear program.  "Apparently the White House is waiting for 
the results of the political battle in Iran, which will either 
weaken the fist or make it stronger." 
 
"SECRET MUSLIM" 
 
¶5.  Pro-government, Kazakh-language "Aikyn" wrote, "The Muslim 
community all over the world is supportive of and thankful for 
Obama's address."  The author opined that American analysts were 
wondering "why Obama has such a warm heart for Muslims."  He 
speculated that some of them connect this with Obama's father being 
Muslim, while the President's mother is believed to be Catholic and 
he says he is Christian, "analysts do not exclude the possibility 
that the U.S. President might be a secret Muslim."

BLOG ALERT 
 
¶6.  Independent Internet outlet "Geokz.tv" published a statement by 
the Union of Muslims of Kazakhstan, a small association independent 
of the official Islamic hierarchy, that said that Obama's speech 
"resonated widely throughout the world" and would help develop 
relations between the United States and the Muslim community.  "We 
want to believe that there was more sincere emotion than political 
pragmatism in the speech.  The American leader's speech gives hope." 
 While acknowledging that perhaps Obama would encounter "insuperable 
obstacles" on this path, "nevertheless his audacious attempt to 
destroy obsolete stereotypes deserves our sympathy and respect." 
 
¶7.  The web site of the opposition, Russian-language "Respublika" 
newspaper, noted that it was "very symbolic" that Obama didn't visit 
Israel during his trip to the Middle East.  In his Cairo speech, he 
promised to help Palestinians "like no other American president had 
done before."  At the same time, Obama stressed that Israel had an 
"irrevocable right" to exist.  "Political observers question whether 
it is possible for Obama to have it both ways."  The author 
concluded by pointing out that "the U.S. President is being 
subjected to severe (domestic) criticism" and saying that he might 
have decided to make this trip "to avoid growing discontent at 
home."
