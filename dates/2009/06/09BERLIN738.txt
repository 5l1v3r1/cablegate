¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Germany has had spike of H1N1 cases 
throughout the country, resulting in an average daily increase 
in new cases of over ten percent over the past two weeks.  We 
review the country's outbreak status daily and are 
implementing measures consistent with Mission tripwire two. 
This cable summarizes the actions taken by Mission Management, 
Consular, and Health Unit sections. Mission Economic section 
reports and coordinates the work of post's Pandemic Influenza 
Working Group. END SUMMARY. 
 
 
H1N1 Infection status 
--------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) As of June 18, the National Reference Center for 
Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) had confirmed 229 
new cases of H1N1 in Germany.  The majority of infections were 
originally assessed to derive from travelers to the US, but 
domestic transmission within Germany is now increasing.  As is 
the case elsewhere, most of the new infections in Germany 
involve children and young adults. We have seen a spike of 
cases throughout the country, with a simple growth rate in new 
cases exceeding ten percent daily over the past two weeks. 
In the wake of the recent, heavily anticipated World Health 
Organization (WHO) increase in its pandemic flu alert level, 
German health authorities remain calm. "We have expected WHO 
to raise the alert level", German Health Minister Ulla Schmidt 
said.  Germany's National Pandemic Plan guides federal and 
state coordination as the virus continues to spread. As 
preventive measures, health authorities have advised the 
public to consider hygiene measures such as washing hands 
several times a day and have disseminated information on 
national websites to inform the public. 
 
 
Mission Tripwire level 
---------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Mission Germany's tripwires document describes 
Tripwire two as the following:  "Clusters of infection, but 
human-to-human spread still localized, suggesting the virus is 
becoming increasingly better adapted to humans, but may not 
yet be fully transmissible."  Tripwire three is defined as, 
"Virus begins to show higher lethality rate or causes people 
to be very ill outside of source region, even, if it does not 
sweep across Europe. OR Flu in its current form (very few 
deaths outside source region, few patients gravely ill) sweeps 
across Europe, causing widespread illness and workplace 
absenteeism."  Given the small number of cases and the low 
lethality of the current virus, the Mission Pandemic Influenza 
Working Group assesses that we remain at tripwire 2. 
 
 
Mission Management actions 
-------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Management has broadcast Mission-wide staff 
announcements with recommendations on preparing for an 
influenza pandemic.  These have included useful information 
and links to helpful websites as part of our effort to ensure 
readiness and staff safety.  Management has also procured hand 
sanitizer for various sections.  The Community Liaison Office 
(CLO) in Frankfurt is in direct contact with three schools 
that Consulate children attend and will be notified if 
students contract H1N1.  CLO Berlin is also in close contact 
with all of the schools Embassy children attend in Berlin and 
Brandenburg and should be notified of any cases that may occur. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Regional Security Office (RSO) has procured an 
adequate supply of masks, rubber gloves and hand sanitizing 
gel for the local guard force at post throughout Mission 
Germany.  These supplies have been placed at nearby locations 
 
BERLIN 00000738  002 OF 002 
 
 
for immediate deployment, should circumstances dictate.  As a 
security precaution, local guards have been briefed on 
identifying and responding to persons with symptoms of H1N1. 
As appropriate, RSO will consult and coordinate with the U.S. 
military, officials from nearby international airports, and 
local government and public services to ensure a consistent 
and measured response with those around Mission Germany 
facilities. 
 
 
Mission Consular actions 
------------------------ 
 
¶5. (SBU) Mission Consular leaders have created a selection of 
permanent links to the Mission's American Citizens Services 
(ACS) webpage, providing the public with instant access to 
information from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC) for up-to-date information on U.S. 
countermeasures and practical protective measures.  It also 
links to the WHO for updates on worldwide developments.   In 
coordination with RSO and the Health Unit, all Consular 
sections in Germany have deployed anti-septic hand sanitizers 
to staff members dealing with the public or handling mail and 
are implementing general guidance on frequent hand washing and 
covering up when sneezing or coughing.  Further steps will 
include the procurement and deployment of hand-sanitizer 
stations for use by the public in consular waiting rooms 
(deployed by Consulate Munich; Frankfurt is in the process of 
procuring items).  Consular staff members are instructed to 
stay home if they develop flu-like symptoms.  We have not yet 
taken steps to limit public access to Consular sections, but 
we closely monitor the actions of other posts in the region 
and of German public health authorities.  Consular leaders are 
making contingency plans in order to implement gradual 
restrictions on public access if future circumstances warrant. 
 
 
Mission Health Unit actions 
--------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Mission Germany's Health Unit (HU) has inventoried 
and purchased additional supplies of personal protective 
equipment (PPE), including gloves, masks, and antiviral 
medications.  HU has confirmed stockpiles of Tamiflu and 
Relenza.  HU and RSO have discussed modifying Consulate entry 
procedures, when necessary. HU is consulting with German 
health authorities to develop a mechanism for testing for H1N1 
in country.
