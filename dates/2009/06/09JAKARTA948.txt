(SBU)  Per reftel instruction, Mission reached out to Defense 
and Foreign Affairs contacts who confirmed that Indonesia 
does have six active Mi-17 helicopters.  These aircraft are 
part of the government's lift capability for humanitarian 
assistance and disaster relief.  This is an important 
priority for Indonesia, which suffers from periodic natural 
disasters, including the December 2004 tsunami and the May 
2006 Jogjakarta earthquake.  In light of this, Mission 
believes it is unlikely that these helicopters are available 
for donation, purchase or lease.  If Washington, nonetheless, 
wants us to pursue this with the GoI, please advise.
