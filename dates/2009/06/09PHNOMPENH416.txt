SUBJECT: CAMBODIA SUPPORTIVE OF STRONG ASEAN STATEMENT ON 
UNSCR 1874 
 
REF: STATE 64133 
 
Classified By: A/DCM SCOT COVERT FOR REASONS 1.4 (B, D) 
 
¶1.  (C) Ministry of Foreign Affairs Secretary of State for 
ASEAN Affairs Kao Kim Hourn told Pol/Ec Chief June 23 that 
Cambodia was supportive of a strong ASEAN statement on UNSCR 
1874 and North Korea, and would lean toward supporting even 
stronger language than the ASEAN's joint press statement with 
the ROK at the ASEAN/Korea Commemorative Summit on June 2. 
 
¶2.  (C)  Kao Kim Hourn noted the progression of ASEAN 
attitudes since the ASEM Foreign Ministers meeting in Hanoi 
and the ASEAN-EU meeting in Phnom Penh.  He noted that 
Cambodia was very consistent in its position condemning North 
Korea for its recent nuclear test and missile launches. 
Despite having relations with North Korea, the Royal 
Government of Cambodia (RGC) was very firm on this, he said, 
putting the position in the context of support for the 
Southeast Asian Nuclear Weapons Free Zone. 
 
¶3.  (C)  Noting that he expected the subject to be one of the 
more important topics raised at the ARF-related meetings in 
Phuket in July, Kao Kim Hourn said that the RGC was in favor 
of North Korea stopping nuclear testing (and bullying) and 
going back to the Six-Party Talks.  He also said that Burma 
has caught the attention of Foreign Minister Hor Namhong, who 
has been more critical of the Burmese junta in recent months, 
calling for all charges against Aung San Suu Kyi to be 
dropped and for her immediate release.  Kao Kim Hourn 
expected stronger sentiments against the Junta among most 
other ASEAN members.
