HUMAN RIGHTS RAPPORTEUR FOR SUDAN 
 
¶1. (SBU) Burkinabe Foreign Minister Yoda called Ambassador 
Rice on June 10 to request U.S. views on the mandate renewal 
of the Special Rapporteur for Human Rights for Sudan. 
Ambassador Rice stressed the U.S. wants a robust new mandate 
for the Rapporteur, noting Sudan need not fear a rapporteur 
if it abides by its commitments to protect human rights. 
Yoda said Sudanese President Bashir was lobbying for the 
African Group to vote against the Rapporteur.  Yoda confirmed 
Burkina Faso would abstain from the vote if the African Group 
does indeed decide to vote against a Rapporteur. 
 
¶2. (SBU) FM Yoda said both President Campaore and he remained 
committed to strengthening further its relationship with the 
United States.  He asked Ambassador Rice's assistance in 
conveying to Secretary Clinton his desire to work with her on 
a range of international and regional issues.  Ambassador 
Rice thanked Burkina Faso for its leadership in the Security 
Council and on African issues, and she welcomed his expressed 
desire to enhance further our strong bilateral relationship.
