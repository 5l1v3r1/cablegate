Re:  Fax of June 10, 2009 
 
Dear Mr. First Secretary: 
 
Regarding the above-referenced fax and your telephone conversation 
on the same day, we have researched the precise answers to your 
questions regarding the fiber optic inverters we received from 
Schott North America. 
 
We can confirm that we indeed received the two sets of inverters on 
the dates mentioned in your fax, containing 540 units whose total 
value was USD89,100. 
 
The inverters were requested by our company for the fabrication of 
image intensifier tubes whose ultimate end user was the Algerian 
Ministry of Defense, after integration by the intermediate consignee 
Thales Netherlands B.V. 
 
However, the initial order from our client Thales Netherlands B.V. 
was canceled and we are hoping that, upon receiving a new order, we 
will be allowed to use the license given to us by the Department of 
State on November 13, 2008 which expires November 12, 2012. 
 
Pending this future order, the inverters are stocked at our building 
in Brive de Gaillarde by the license holder Photonis France SAS. 
 
We hope to seek an eventual client via Schott North America for the 
sale of these inverters. The company, from time to time, assists us 
in finding a new client for orders that haven't been fully executed 
according to the terms of the original agreement. 
 
Should you need any further information, please contact me directly 
as I am the General Counsel in charge of compliance for the group. 
 
(Complimentary Close)
