SUBJECT: HONG KONG H1N1 UPDATE - FIRST LOCAL H1N1 
TRANSMISSION, HKG ANNOUNCES SCHOOL CLOSURES 
 
REF: HONG KONG 940 
 
¶1.  Summary: The Hong Kong Government (HKG) announced the 
first confirmed local transmission of H1N1 in Hong Kong on 
June 10, followed by confirmation on June 11 that 12 students 
were infected in a cluster of cases at the same school.  The 
HKG announced a series of additional steps as required by 
HKG's existing protocols, including extensive school 
closures, intended to contain this community outbreak.  End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  Hong Kong health officials disclosed the first confirmed 
case of local H1N1 transmission on June 10.  The individual 
involved did not travel outside of Hong Kong during the 
incubation period and was confirmed to have been in contact 
with an individual who tested positive for the virus.  The 
same day, officials revealed that a 16-year-old Hong Kong 
student also tested positive.  While the source of her 
infection is unclear, 11 students at St. Paul's Convent 
School were suspected of having been infected by exposure to 
her.  In response, the HKG immediately ordered St. Paul's 
closed for two weeks. 
 
¶3.  Test results released June 11 confirmed the 11 classmates 
are infected with H1N1.  In response to the cluster of cases 
and in line with Hong Kong,s existing protocol, the 
Education Bureau announced a 14-day closure of all nurseries, 
kindergartens and primary schools, effective June 12.  The 
HKG will assess the situation weekly, beginning June 18, to 
determine whether conditions permit the re-opening of 
schools.  If schools do not re-open by July 10, all affected 
schools will go into summer recess. 
 
¶4.  The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) said the HKG will 
announce the opening of eight "flu clinics" throughout Hong 
Kong.  These clinics are designed to be the primary source of 
treatment for residents who exhibit symptoms consistent with 
H1N1.  CHP will make a series of public announcements 
explaining the clinic plan.  Plans are in place to open an 
additional 10 clinics, as and where needed. 
 
¶5.  For the present time, the treatment of infected or 
suspected cases remains the same.  Isolation wards are 
operating at public hospitals to handle confirmed cases and 
individuals in close contact with an identified case are 
required to undergo medically supervised treatment and 
monitoring.  If the infection rate overwhelms Hong Kong,s 
public health services, including the soon-to-be established 
"flu clinics," CHP plans to provide infected and suspected 
individuals medication and require self-quarantine at home.
