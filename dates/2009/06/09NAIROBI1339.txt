¶2. (SBU) On June 26, Ambassador Ranneberger visited injured 
Somali elders and Transitional Federal Government (TFG) 
troops at Nairobi West Hospital.  Ten of the wounded Somalis 
had been victims of the June 18 suicide bombing in Beletweyne 
that killed TFG Minister of National Security Omar Hashi 
(reftel).  Four others were TFG troops who had been injured 
in recent fighting in Mogadishu, and subsequently evacuated 
to Nairobi.  The Ambassador, who was accompanied by officials 
from the Somali Embassy in Nairobi, had private discussions 
with several of the patients, reiterating U.S. support for 
the TFG. 
 
¶3. (U) After visiting the wounded Somalis inside the wards, 
the Ambassador addressed Somali and Kenyan media outside the 
hospital.  The Ambassador commented on U.S. support for the 
TFG at this critical juncture, noting that the TFG continues 
to enjoy U.S. and international support, particularly during 
the current fight against the extremist opposition. 
Responding to questions on the June 25 media report of U.S. 
weapons shipments to Somalia, the Ambassador noted that the 
shipments had come after UNSC approval and stated that the 
assistance is aimed at helping the legitimate government of 
Somalia. 
 
¶4. (U) Media coverage of the visit was very positive. 
Somali-language radio Star FM highlighted the Ambassador's 
condolences to victims and families of the victims of the 
June 18 bombing, and also noted the Ambassador's comment that 
the U.S. will support the TFG, which enjoys support of the 
Somali people.  Radio stations Simba and Frontier FM, both 
Somali outlets, carried similar coverage.  Somali-languge 
Eastern Television Network (ETN) also highlighted the fact 
that the weapons shipment had come after UNSC approval. 
Kenyan press, which has lately been very interested in 
Somalia issues (septel), also covered the event widely.  KTN 
and NTV in Kenya covered the event, focusing on the arms 
shipments and recent turmoil in Somalia.  The Kenya Times, 
Saturday edition, noted the Ambassador's comment that the 
U.S. is confident in the success of the TFG.  The People 
Daily reported that the Ambassador affirmed that the U.S. was 
ready to support Kenya's efforts to prevent al-Shabaab 
violence from spreading into Kenya.
