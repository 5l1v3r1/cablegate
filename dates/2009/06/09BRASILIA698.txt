¶1. (SBU) On June 4, Post delivered the two demarches and provided 
the referenced non-papers in REFTELS concerning the June 15-19 
meeting of the Board of Governors (BOG) of the International Atomic 
Energy Agency (IAEA) to the Ministry of External Relations' (MRE) 
Division of Disarmament and Sensitive Technologies (DDS) Director 
Santiago Mourao and Deputy Director Fabio Antibus. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Per REFTEL A, Environment, Science & Technology, and 
Health (ESTH) Counselor emphasized the importance of providing the 
IAEA sufficient resources to do its work, which means a significant 
real increase in the budget.  Further, ESTH Counselor stressed the 
value of moving the currently voluntarily funded nuclear security 
activity into the regular budget.  The Brazilians appreciated 
receiving the information, but were non-committal.  Antibus did 
comment that the MRE wanted to "minimize the increase" in the IAEA 
budget.  He pointed to the struggle within the MRE and then with the 
Finance Ministry to obtain increases for the budgets of 
international organizations. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Per REFTEL B, the ESTH Counselor voiced the USG's and 
others' support for the establishment of multilateral nuclear fuel 
assurances under the auspices of the IAEA.  In addition, he urged 
Brazil to support a full and open discussion of the topic at the 
June BOG meeting.  Here too the Brazilians thanked the USG for the 
information, but were non-committal. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Post will relay any response, questions or comments 
received from the Brazilians concerning these two demarches before 
their delegation leaves for the June BOG.
