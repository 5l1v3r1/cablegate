REF: A. STATE 58034 
     ¶B. SICADE/BELLARD EMAIL 6/5/09 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  PolMinCouns on June 5 delivered ref a demarche to 
Assistant to the Cabinet for Foreign and Defence Policy 
Gordon Venner and Director of Operations for the Foreign and 
Defence Policy Secretariat at the Privy Council Office 
Matthew Levin, and strongly urged that Canada defer 
introduction of the freedom of expression resolution while 
our two governments worked together to ensure introduction of 
consensus resolution in September.  Venner said that Canada's 
main concern was that another country would during the 
remainder of the current session introduce another, unhelpful 
resolution.  He said that, if there is indeed confidence that 
we could work to prevent this outcome, Canada would have no 
problem in not introducing the resolution at this time.  He 
said that he well recalled the circumstances that led Canada 
to withdraw its co-sponsorship in 2008, and that Canada 
definitely did not want a re-play of that scenario this year. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Separately, PolMinCouns shared ref a demarche with 
Foreign Minister Lawrence Cannon's Policy Advisor Kyle Vis. 
Vis expressed satisfaction at the apparent resolution of this 
issue in Geneva (ref b), and promised to be additionally 
helpful as needed on this issue in the future.
