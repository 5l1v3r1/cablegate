SUBJECT: HK H1N1 UPDATE - LOCAL TRANSMISSION TAKES ROOT, 
MACAU HOSTS AIR TRAVEL AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE CONFERENCE 
 
REF: HONG KONG 1065 
 
¶1.  Summary: H1N1 cases in Hong Kong continue to increase, 
including new community transmissions, despite school 
closures.  Four secondary schools have now been closed, 
joining all nursery, kindergarten and primary schools in Hong 
Kong.  Additional secondary schools will be closed as 
outbreaks occur.  The shift to additional community 
transmission is forcing the Hong Kong Government (HKG) to 
abandon efforts to contain the virus and move toward a 
mitigation strategy.  Macau authorities released four AmCits 
from quarantine after they arrived in Hong Kong on a plane 
with an infected passenger.  None tested positive for H1N1. 
Macau hosted the third Asian Steering Committee for the 
Cooperative Arrangement for Preventing the Spread of 
Communicable Diseases Through Air Travel (CAPSCA), June 
12-13, where World Health Organization (WHO) representatives 
defended WHO's decision not to mandate H1N1 border screening. 
 End Summary. 
 
¶2.  The number of confirmed H1N1 cases in Hong Kong continues 
to increase, with the HKG announcing a total of 118 
infections on June 16.  The community transmission rate 
continues to increase as well, with 9 of 14 newly identified 
cases resulting from local contact rather than international 
travel. 
 
¶3.  School closures (Reftel) have not been completely 
effective at stopping the community spread of H1N1 in Hong 
Kong.  Three additional secondary schools, including the 
Australian International School, were ordered closed June 
16-17 due to outbreaks.  27 of the H1N1 cases in Hong Kong 
occurred among student populations of the now-closed schools, 
including 22 cases at St. Paul's Convent School, the site of 
the original school outbreak.  The HKG continues to monitor 
the situation and can be expected to continue closing 
secondary schools on a case-by-case basis as outbreaks occur. 
 
¶4.  The Hospital Authority announced June 16 that they will 
no longer admit all suspected H1N1 cases to hospitals for 
testing and observation.  Instead, suspected cases will be 
identified and tested at one of the HKG-operated flu clinics, 
provided with Tamiflu and sent home.  Those individuals who 
test positive for H1N1 will be contacted and asked to report 
to a hospital for treatment and isolation.  This new policy 
is a result of the HKG decision to move from a "containment" 
strategy to embracing a "mitigation" strategy for handling 
the outbreak. 
 
Macau Quarantines AmCits, Hosts CAPSCA 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶5.  Macau health authorities released four AmCits on June 16 
who had been quarantined in Macau since June 8-9.  The four 
arrived in Macau from Hong Kong and had been identified as 
sitting near H1N1-infected passengers on their flights to 
Hong Kong.  None developed symptoms of H1N1.  Four other 
AmCits are currently quarantined in Macau. 
 
¶6.  Macau hosted the third Asian Steering Committee for 
CAPSCA, June 12-13.  Attendees included participating member 
and observer country delegations, international 
organizations, non-governmental organizations and aviation 
industry representatives.  Initiated by the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2006, CAPSCA's goal is 
to reduce the spread of disease by air travelers through 
efforts by member states, air operators and airports.  This 
conference was held only hours after the WHO's announcement 
of the H1N1 Phase 6 Pandemic Alert.  Although H1N1 dominated 
the CAPSCA agenda, participants were reminded that H5N1 
(Avian Influenza) is still "the deadliest viral threat to the 
region that requires everyone's commitment and vigilance." 
 
¶7.  Local attendees questioned WHO's decision not to 
recommend border screening for H1N1.  The WHO representative 
defended WHO's decision, particularly regarding the utility 
of thermal scanning.  According to WHO, these measures are 
not effective in preventing H1N1's global spread because some 
infected travelers are asymptomatic, yet still contagious. 
The WHO representative cited "less than 2% of the 27,737 H1N1 
cases, as of June 11" as having been detected by border 
screening measures.
