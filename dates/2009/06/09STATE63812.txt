FROM NEA ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY JEFFREY 
FELTMAN FOR CHARGE MILES 
 
I commend Embassy Ashgabat and in particular 
Iran Watcher Inger Tangborn, for its 
excellent reporting on the Iranian elections. 
Embassy insights were extremely useful for 
their timeliness and for the helpful view 
from "man on the street" Iranians. 
Your second cable in particular 
identified the interesting trend that 
Mousavi was picking up votes from rural 
voters.  This excellent reporting provided 
key insights to 7th floor principals and NEA. 
 
Embassy reporting gave Washington recipients 
an important view of working class Iranians' views on 
the elections.  Washington appreciates this reporting 
that represents a key socioeconomic class from a variety 
of geographic areas and ethnic groups -- a group 
to which we might not otherwise have access. 
By continuing and expanding your outreach, 
you have provided an important 
snapshot of the elections.  This crucial information has 
helped NEA and key principals in deciphering the 
maze of Iranian electoral politics. 
 
We look forward to further high quality reporting 
from Embassy Ashgabat as we look to interpret 
the election results and information you garner 
from this key socioeconomic class and other contacts. 
 
You have set a high standard for your colleagues 
here in Washington and elsewhere. 
 
Best, 
 
Jeff
