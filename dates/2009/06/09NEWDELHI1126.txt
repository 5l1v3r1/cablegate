SUBJECT: EMERGENCY ACTION COMMITTEE MEETING 
 
Classified By: Charge d'Affairs Peter Burleigh for Reasons 1.4 (B, D) 

¶1. (S//NF) Embassy New Delhi's Emergency Action Committee (EAC) met on June 2 to discuss an increased threat stemming from the release of Jammat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Saeed from house arrest.  Regional Affairs has seen credible intelligence suggesting there are multiple threads of terrorist planning ongoing in India, some of which are possibly tied to Saeed's release.  The EAC agreed to issue a warden message and remind U.S. citizens of potential attacks and advise increased vigilance. 

¶2.  (S) The Charge will put in an urgent call to Minister of Home Affairs Chidambaram informing him that the U.S. had credible information of a possible attack related to the release of Saeed.  The RSO will consult with the  Consulates General about heightened awareness, and the EAC will meet again on June 3 to follow up with any new information that comes to light over night.
