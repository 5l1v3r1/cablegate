¶1. PolOff delivered ref A demarche encouraging China to 
support a significant real increase in the IAEA regular 
budget and to move costs associated with nuclear security 
into the regular budget to Arms Control and Disarmament 
Department Nuclear Division Deputy Director Zhang Shen on 
June 5.  Zhang responded that China would consider a real 
budget increase based on the "general principle" that the 
"IAEA budget should be in line with activities of the IAEA." 
Zhang said he would share the information provided by PolOff 
with the China Atomic Energy Agency, which "controls the 
funds" provided by China to the IAEA.
