Summary 
------- 

¶1. (C) On June 22, IMF Resident Representative Humberto 
Arbulu Neira told the Ambassador that Nicaragua has a "60 
percent" chance of obtaining IMF budget support for 2009 and 
¶2010.  To improve the odds, Arbulu said that Nicaragua must 
cut expenditures from the 2009 budget.  In line with the IMF 
request, on June 24 the Executive Branch submitted a budget 
to the National Assembly that would cut overall spending from 
$1.64 billion to $1.56 billion.  However, due to decreased 
revenues, the fiscal deficit could actually increase from 
$324 million to $369 million.  Thus, without international 
financial institutions replacing funds withdrawn by European 
donors in the wake of fraudulent municipal elections held in 
November 2008, the government could face a major fiscal 
crisis.  However, we expect that one way or another the 
Ortega administration will find a way to fill the budget gap. 
 
IMF Requests Budget Cuts 
------------------------ 

¶2. (C) On June 22, IMF Resident Representative Humberto 
Arbulu Neira briefed the Ambassador on his recent visit to 
IMF headquarters.  Arbulu accompanied officials from the 
Nicaraguan Central Bank and Ministry of Finance in Washington 
as they sought to conclude negotiations for IMF budget 
support (Ref A).  He estimated that Nicaragua's chances of 
obtaining budget support for 2009 and 2010 stood at about "60 
percent."  To improve Nicaragua's odds, Arbulu told the 
Ambassador that the government must amend the 2009 budget to 
cut expenditures.  In addition to spending cuts, Arbulu told 
the Ambassador that IMF officials considered tax and pension 
reform to be high-priority mandates for Nicaragua.  On tax 
reform, Arbulu said that the IMF wants to see the Nicaragua 
decrease the number of tax exemptions currently granted to 
many "nonproductive" sectors of the economy. 
 
¶3. (C) While Arbulu praised Central Bank President Antenor 
Rosales' presentation of the Nicaraguan case in Washington, 
he said the IMF is somewhat hesitant to grant budget support 
to the government--$35 million in 2009, with an additional 
$50 million from the World Bank and Inter-American 
Development Bank (IDB) contingent on an IMF program--unless a 
very sound case is made.  The IMF does not want to be seen as 
replacing donor support canceled by European donors outraged 
over the government's failure to respond constructively to 
charges of massive electoral fraud in the November 2008 
municipal elections.  Moreover, Arbulu told the Ambassador 
that IMF professional staff are not fully convinced that 
Nicaragua's case has technical merits. 
 
Ortega Submits Budget with Spending Cuts 
---------------------------------------- 

¶4. (C) On June 24, while attending a summit of the Bolivarian 
Alternative for the Americas (ALBA) held in Venezuela, 
President Ortega said, "Not having an agreement with the IMF 
would paralyze everything."  That same day, the executive 
branch delivered an amendment to the 2009 budget to the 
National Assembly.  In line with the IMF request, the budget 
would cut overall spending from $1.64 billion to $1.560 
billion.  Reflecting a decrease in tax collections, the new 
budget forecasts revenue of $1.19 billion, down from $1.32 
billion in the original budget.  According to this scenario, 
the fiscal deficit could actually increase, from $324 million 
to $369 million.  Of this amount, as much as $238 million is 
to be financed with short-term domestic debt.  External 
financing--principally from the IMF, World Bank, and 
IDB--would cover the balance, about $131 million. 
 
Comment 
------- 

¶5. (C) If the IMF (together with the World Bank and IDB) do not come through with funding, Nicaragua could be plunged into a major fiscal crisis, with political consequences that are difficult to judge. Donors (and IMF staff) may find that in the final analysis, allowing the IMF to provide funding is more palatable than such a crisis, even if it means that the government will have escaped any consequences of European suspension of budget support in response to electoral fraud. Alternatively, Venezuela could step up to the plate and provide funding. We defer to Embassy Caracas with regard to how much of a strain this would be for Chazez, but note that the sums involved are not huge. A third alternative may be that, if the IMF provides funds instead for Central Bank reserves, the Central Bank may, in turn, find a way to provide financing. One way or another, we expect the government to find a way to plug its budget hole.
