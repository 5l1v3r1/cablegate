¶1. (SBU) On June 19, 2009, armed "technicians" representing Nicaragua's telecommunications regulator (Instituto Nicaraguense de Telecomunicaciones y Correos, TELCOR) and Nicaraguan customs (DGA) seized $6,000 to $10,000 worth of broadcasting equipment from radio station La Ley in Sebaco, Matagalpa (approximately 100 kilometers northeast of Managua). TELCOR also blocked the radio station's frequency. Radio La Ley's proprietor, Santiago Aburto, had planned to inaugurate the station June 20. Aburto initially had been granted the station's frequency in 2004 during President Enrique Bolanos' government. Aburto, a staunch supporter of opposition leader and National Assembly Deputy Eduardo Montealegre, currently hosts a radio show on Radio Corporacion where he frequently criticizes Daniel Ortega's government and the honorary president of the Constitutional Liberal Party (PLC), Arnold Aleman. TELCOR representatives claimed Aburto had violated the telecommunications law (reftel), but many Nicaraguans believe the government's sudden action against the radio station was politically motivated.
 
¶2.  (SBU) At the time of the seizure, DGA officials told 
Aburto that he had violated customs regulations. Aburto, 
however, asserted that this was impossible as he had 
purchased all the equipment in Nicaragua.  Later, TELCOR's 
Executive President Orlando Castillo told media that the 
action against Radio La Ley was due to Aburto's failure to 
use the frequency he was granted within the specified time 
frame.  According to Castillo, the payments Aburto had made 
to renew his broadcasting license since 2004 were not valid. 
Nonetheless, TELCOR had continued to accept the payments 
without advising Aburto of the situation.  Castillo also 
mentioned that TELCOR was reviewing the operating permits of 
other radio stations. 
 
¶3.  (C) According to media and local attorneys, TELCOR did 
not follow the proper legal procedures to close Radio La Ley. 
 Experts observed that while government authorities could 
legally argue for the closure of the radio station, the 
confiscation of the broadcast equipment was completely 
outside the law.  Eduardo Gonzalez, a well-known radio 
personality, told us that he believed this was the 
government's warning to independent media to tone down its 
rhetoric against the Ortega administration.  This sentiment 
was widely shared among Nicaraguans.  Opposition leader 
Eduardo Montealegre told media that "this was a warning to 
all Nicaraguans and the independent press ... only 
totalitarian regimes cannot accept freedom of expression." 
Monsignor Abelardo Mata, the Vice President of Nicaragua's 
Episcopal Conference and Bishop of Esteli, said the TELCOR 
action against Radio La Ley appeared to represent the 
government's desire and intention to silence any voice that 
did not praise the Ortega administration.

COMMENT

¶4. (C) TELCOR's and the DGA's unconvincing justification for their actions leads us to believe that the closure of Radio La Ley was politically motivated -- an unwarranted and arbitrary move by the Government of Nicaragua (GON) to silence and intimidate anyone it views as the opposition. If the GON is indeed moving to silence opposition or independent media outlets, this action would have dire consequences on the viability of Nicaragua's remaining democratic institutions.
