Â¶1. (SBU)  On June 4, PolOff spoke with Sanchita Haque, Senior 
Assistant Secretary in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) 
UN and Human Rights Wing, to convey reftel points, urging the 
Government of Bangladesh (GOB) to support the extension of 
the Special Rapporteur,s term by one year and a strong 
resolution on the human rights situation in Sudan.  Haque 
said the GOB welcomed the USG,s concern. She pointed out 
that the government had yet to make a decision on this issue 
and that it would be done by the Mission in Geneva only after 
consultation with other members of the Organization of 
Islamic Conference (OIC).  She added that Bangladesh has 
typically voted to abstain on country specific human rights 
resolutions, based on the principle of non-interference and 
on the belief that such resolutions are often politically 
motivated.
