¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  The relatively new Brazilian Chico Mendes 
Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio), the agency 
responsible for national parks and protected area system, has 
launched a program to improve its park management.  It seeks to 
introduce public use plans for its parks, and the USG is providing 
technical support for this effort.  The U.S. Forest Service provided 
an expert on special uses, permits and concessions to a recent 
ICMBio workshop of park managers in Foz do Iguassu and is hosting 
visits by key ICMBio officials.  The introduction of effective 
public use planning and the development of concession plans should 
help generate revenues to support ICMBio's activities as well as 
improve public access to protected areas around Brazil.  These 
activities will also promote reducing deforestation and conserving 
biodiversity. END SUMMARY. 
 
BACKGROUND 
 
¶2.  (SBU) ICMBio was created in 2007 and manages a large number of 
parks and protected areas, covering over 20% of Brazil's territory. 
ICMBio is attempting to prepare or review concession plans for ten 
priority national parks by the end of 2009.  In September 2008, 
Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva announced the "Tourism 
in Parks" Program, which details the various actions and activities 
that will be implemented by both the Ministry of Environment (MMA) 
and the Ministry of Tourism (MT) in order to increase the number of 
visitors in the country's national parks.  For the first part of the 
Program, the Government of Brazil will invest approximately USD 11.5 
million.  MMA and MT will be responsible for investing USD 7 million 
and USD 4.5 million, respectively, for the improvement of park 
infrastructure such as trails, camping areas, and also larger 
structures such as roads and airports in remote areas. 
 
USG SUPPORT 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Iguassu National Park is Brazil's most visited and best 
developed park.  It also is unique with its concession contract, 
which provides for a hotel and numerous recreational activities. 
The first concession contract was signed in December of 1998 for a 
fifteen-year period.  After the conclusion of the recent economic 
feasibility study for Iguassu, a five-year extension was agreed 
upon.  USAID funded this economic feasibility study and also funded 
a similar study for the Fernando de Noronha Marine National Park. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Participants in the April 1 Seminar included ICMBio's 
legal counsel and environmental analysts working on park management 
activities.  Presentations were about the legal aspect of Brazil's 
concession system and the concessionaires' perspective of the 
partnership.    In response to a request from ICMBio's Director of 
Public Uses, Julio Gonchorosky, U.S Forest Service and Embassy 
representatives provided supported for the seminar   Gonchorosky is 
seeking to develop a partnership with the USG in protected areas 
management. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) USFS sent Robert Kates ,a Special Uses Program Manager, to 
give a presentation on the history of concessions in the United 
States' protected areas.  Kates explained the current U.S. Forest 
Service and National Park Service concession process, as well as 
challenges faced and lessons learned.  He also participated on a 
panel with Gonchorosky, Guilhermo Martin (head of public uses for 
Argentina National Parks) and Camila Rodrigues (Brazilian Ministry 
of the Environment Protected Areas Specialist) on concessions. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The U.S. Forest Service coordinated a technical visit to 
provide additional support for Brazil's efforts with protected areas 
management.  In May and June, 2009, two key ICMBio coordinators from 
the Office of Public Use under the Directory of Protected Areas 
visited the United States for technical field trips and meetings for 
a three week period.  The main purpose of the visit was to get 
familiar with the work of the U.S. Forest Service and National Park 
Service with an emphasis on economic modeling, development of 
concessions, monitoring of special uses permits and concessions and 
the overall supervision of concession activities.  Upon their 
return, they will now help train ICMBio staff in preparation for the 
development of Brazil's national concession plans as well as the 
development of the Scope of Work for an upcoming U.S. Forest Service 
technical visit to Brazil. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) At the end of July, 2009, Gonchorosky will lead a small 
team from ICMBio in a technical visit to the United States to better 
understand the challenges faced by the different agencies 
responsible for the management of parks, forests and wildlife 
reserves.  The main topics of discussion will include visitation, 
concessions, concession services monitoring, infrastructure, 
protection, research, access to remote protected areas and human

resource allocation.  Moreover, in September 2009, U.S. Forest 
Service experts will come to Brazil for a three week period to 
assist the Brazilians in the process of evaluating ICMBio's needs as 
they are establishing the appropriate public uses for various 
protected areas.  This U.S. Forest Service team will work with 
ICMBio to develop a three year workplan, which will provide guidance 
on activities such as concession planning, monitoring, management, 
overall capacity building, and project development.  Also this team 
will strengthen the relationship between the U.S. Forest Service and 
ICMBio.  In addition, the U.S. Forest Service is collaborating with 
Colorado State University to develop a workshop and provide speakers 
during Brazil's Protected Area Congress.  The three-day workshop 
will provide training on Public Use Planning. 
¶8.  (SBU) COMMENT: Brazil is taking positive steps as it develops 
its protected areas policies.  The partnership between ICMBio and 
the U.S Forest Service and the National Park Service has good 
prospects for being very fruitful.  The Brazilians are looking to 
the United States for technical expertise to help them move in the 
right direction and avoid repeating our mistakes in this field. 
Fortunately, the USG is able to respond positively.  END COMMENT
