SUBJECT: IAEA Budget Demarche - French will consider 
 
Â¶1. (U) On June 5 ESTH Counselor delivered the demarche to Martin 
Briens, Ministry of Foreign Affairs DAS-equivalent for disarmament 
and non-proliferation, and Olivier Caron, French Atomic Energy 
Agency (CEA) Director for International Affairs, who is also the 
French Governor to the IAEA.  Mr. Caron responded non-committally, 
saying that he would carefully study the "well-drafted demarche" and 
consult further with the Foreign Ministry.  Caron did add, however, 
that at the present time France faces financial constraints and 
implied that France would prefer not to increase the IAEA budget.
