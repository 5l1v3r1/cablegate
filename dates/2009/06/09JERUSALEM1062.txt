Main Stories: 
------------- 
Palestinian print coverage is neutral in tone with Al-Ayyam and 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida running the text of the speech in full and 
Al-Quds front page running  extensive excerpts . 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida leads with and Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam run front 
page coverage on the Palestinian Authority Premier Fayyad's visit to 
Al-Quds University in Abu Deis on June 22 during  which he called 
on the Palestinians to unite  and end the internal division. Fayyad 
urged the Palestinians to support the establishment of the 
Palestinian state and the promotion of  good governance and 
institutional building so that the Palestinian state can become a 
reality in two years, and will live side by side with Israel in a 
comprehensive peace,  according to coverage. Fayyad considered the 
Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's June 14 speech as vague and 
lacked commitment to the two state solution. 
 
Al-Ayyam leads with wire report on recent developments in the 
prisoners' exchange between Israel and Hamas. According to coverage 
that also appears in Al-Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front pages, the 
Israeli government has submitted a new proposal to the Egyptians 
that aims at concluding the prisoners' exchange between Hamas and 
Israel  and will include the releasing of 1000 Palestinian prisoners 
 as well as the release of Israeli  captured Shalit, reporting 
concludes. 
 
The riots in Iran continue to have front page coverage in the 
dailies and lead coverage in Al-Quds. Hundreds of the Iranian 
protestors were arrested and  some were wounded during the 
demonstrations in different Iranian cities. Al-Ayyam runs lead 
photos for an Iranian young lady who was killed by the Iranian 
forces during the protests in Iran. 
 
Al-Quds runs front page coverage citing wire on the King Abdullah of 
Jordan assuring during his meeting with  the British Prime Minister 
Brown in London on June 22 that Israel must stop all provocative 
measures  that threaten chances of reaching a peace settlement in 
the region and jeopardizes the establishment of an independent 
Palestinian state.  King Abdullah  urged the international community 
to take serious measures to support reaching a comprehensive and 
regional peace that will end the Palestinian Israeli conflict based 
on establishing  a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza and 
ensures at the same time the security of Israel. 
 
Al-Quds runs front page coverage citing wire that the Palestinian 
Authority President (PA) Abbas decided to release most of the Hamas 
detainees from the PA detention centers in 24 hours as a good will 
gesture to support the national unity talks, according to coverage.

according to coverage.

in the West Bank cities and confiscating more than 40 dunums in

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Hafith Al-Barghuti opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily 
 
JERUSALEM 00001062  002 OF 002 
 
 
under the title, "The speech of Bar Ilan, the speech of 
Al-Quds",(06/23):  " It is obvious from the location that Prime 
Minister Fayyad chose for his speech that he believes that Jerusalem 
is the capital of the Palestinian state... Fayyad seemed optimistic 
in his tone about the capabilities of the PA to lead a state... 
unlike Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu who does not seem ready to 
believe in a Palestinian state." 
 
2) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title, "Dr. 
Salam Fayyad's speech," (06/23):  "The speech was rational and 
comprehensive... it provided a clear description of the current 
situation in the Palestinian Territories and motivates all parties 
to reach a settlement that will end the conflict... The speech 
stressed that the Palestinian Authority is the sole representative 
of the Palestinian people and is in charge of enforcing law and 
order." 
 
3) Hilmi Al-Ghul opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily under 
the title, "What distinguishes Fayyad's speech," (06/23):  "Although 
the speech was meant to present the new [PA] government's agenda, it 
was basically a reaction to Netanyahu's statements and perceptions 
about the Israeli Palestinian conflict... having Premier Fayyad 
present the official Palestinian reaction to these statements 
clearly reflects how much this man is trusted by the Palestinian 
leadership and conveys a firm message to all parties who try to 
undermine his authority."
