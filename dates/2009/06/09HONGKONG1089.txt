HEADLINES AND EXCERPTS: 
 
¶1. Iran 
 
"True democracy the only answer for Iran" 
 
The independent English-language South China Morning Post said in an 
editorial (6/15):  "Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has 
declared victory in Friday's election.  The country's ruler, supreme 
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has called the win a 'divine 
assessment'.  Irregularities would seem to point less towards a 
democratic vote than yet another power grab by Islamic clerics.  If 
this is the case, a regrettable decision has been made to ignore 
Iranians' constitutional right to determine the direction of their 
nation.  Hopes were high during campaigning that the clerics had 
changed their ways.  Unprecedented debates, genuine grass-roots 
mobilization and equal play in the media for the four presidential 
candidates gave the impression that power was being returned to the 
people.  But cries of fraud have been widespread since election day, 
when opposition communications with the electorate were blocked.... 
Iran's election has caused discontent.  Deep political fissures have 
been created.  If the nation is to move peacefully forward, its 
leaders have to be transparent and open about the results.  True 
democracy is the only way the nation can overcome its myriad 
problems." 
 
"Iran's hard-line policy will hardly change" 
 
The pro-PRC Chinese-language Macau Daily News remarked in an 
editorial (6/14):  "...The international community had always hoped 
that the election would be able to change Iran's foreign policies. 
They hoped that there would have been a breakthrough in relations 
between Iran and the Obama administration.  Thus, the international 
community placed great hopes on the reformist Mousavi.  Mousavi had 
experience in running the country.  When he was the Prime Minister, 
he won public praise for managing the country's economy....  Judging 
from the result of the election, the grassroots in Iran still think 
that Ahmadinejad is their representative.  They believe that Mousavi 
only represents the vested interest groups.  Ahmadinejad is the real 
defender of the revolution....  Regardless of who won the Iranian 
election, it does not matter much because Tehran will not have any 
major changes in its nuclear policy.  Pursuing nuclear programs and 
the confidence of the authorities in Tehran is closely related. 
Thus, the person in power will not change this policy....  Now that 
Ahmadinejad has been reelected, Iran's hard-line policy will not 
change.  Its nuclear programs will still continue.  Once Iran passes 
the nuclear threshold, conflicts with the U.S. can hardly be 
avoided." 
 
¶2. G8 finance ministers meeting 
 
"Capital can easily flow away but not getting back; countries face 
dilemma in rescuing markets" 
 
The independent Chinese-language Hong Kong Economic Times commented 
in an editorial (6/15):  "After the meeting of the G8 finance 
ministers, they said they have to study how to withdraw all the 
economic stimulus measures after the economy recovers.  The market 
believes that the finance ministers' remarks are responding to the 
market's worries about high inflation.  But it also shows that 
bailout measures have brought about serious consequences.  If they 
cannot be resolved, the impact of what comes after will be as 
serious as that of the financial crisis....  U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Geithner said after the G8 meeting that the focus of the policy at 
the present stage is to promote economic growth.  It is too early to 
talk about tightening the policy.  This shows that global efforts to 
rescue the economy have not yet reached a halfway point.  The U.S. 
is still very worried whether the seeds of the economic recovery 
have really sprouted yet.  This is what investors should think about 
carefully."
