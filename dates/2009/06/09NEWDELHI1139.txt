Classified By: CHARGE D'AFFAIRES Peter Burleigh for Reasons 1.4 (B, D) 

¶1. (S/NF) (Summary) The full New Delhi Emergency Action Committee (EAC) convened on 3 June to review information related to threats associated with the release of Hafiz Saeed (REFTEL A, B). The EAC was chaired by CDA Peter Burleigh. The EAC discussed specific aspects of current threat reporting and agreed that the current version of the Country Specific Information sheet adequately addressed the threats to US Citizens (USC) in India. 

¶2. (S/NF) CDA briefed the EAC on his telephone conversation with Indian National Security Advisor M.K. Narayanan on 2 June. During the conversation the CDA advised that the U.S. had credible information about possible attacks on India tied to the release of Hafiz Saeed, chief of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, which had been passed to the GOI in May 2009. CDA further requested that India's Intelligence Bureau (IB) meet with an Office of Regional Affairs (ORA) representative. Regional Affairs met on June 3 with the director of the Indian Intelligence Bureau to discuss the threats. 

¶3. (S/NF) In the EAC, ORA provided an overview of existing terrorist threats in India to include two robust threat streams that may be interrelated. ORA also stated that the threats timed to coincide with the release of Saeed were serious but unspecific. ORA stated that while there is no specific information on LeT threats against American citizens in India at this juncture, LeT is anti-American and citizens of the United States, Israel, and India are considered to be legitimate targets. 

¶4. (S/NF) RSO reported that a Warden Message went out to American citizens and Mission personnel last evening reiterating the high threat of terrorism in India. RSO also indicated that a security notice reminding Mission personnel and family members of the RSO security briefing program, post travel locator and other security support services offered by RSO will be distributed. The RSO requested that mission personnel report suspicious events and rumors for investigation. RSO also indicated that security during the mid-June visits of Under Secretary Burns and Assistant Secretary Blake will be increased to address the current threat environment. RSO also briefed the EAC on the mission's conversion to the Crisis and Emergency Planning Application (CEPA) indicating that most posts were nearing completion in preparation for the Crisis Management exercise this fall. 

¶5. (SBU) RSO updated the EAC on the security environment in Punjab which was the subject of a Warden Message issued 26 May. The body of the Sikh leader killed in Vienna, Austria will be flown in to Jalandhar on or about 4 June which may cause additional unrest. The police are planning road closures on major highways and will have additional personnel in place to handle what may be a second round of wide-spread demonstrations. CDA requested that employees defer travel to Punjab until after the burial ceremonies are complete. 

¶6. (SBU) DCM requested that all section heads review their phone tree to ensure accuracy and ensure that they stress to their staff the importance of completing the post travel locator during the upcoming rest and relaxation and home leave season.
