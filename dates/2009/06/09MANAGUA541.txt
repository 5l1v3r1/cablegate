¶1.  (C) Summary: The Ortega government is drafting a new 
manual that it states would facilitate the administrative 
process for international non-government organizations (NGOs) 
to operate in Nicaragua, but admits the manual will make 
clear that foreign funds should not be used for "political 
purposes."  The government's undefined interpretation of 
"political" has many NGOs worried, and with good reason.  In 
speaking to a group of NGOs, Vice Foreign Minister Valdrack 
Jaentschke admitted the purpose of the new manual was 
political and not administrative, noting the government just 
wanted NGOs to provide infrastructure projects and stay out 
of governance and other issues.  A draft of the manual has 
circulated publicly and local NGOs already have begun to 
voice their opposition.  Unfortunately, as with most matters, 
the Ortega administration might ignore civil society's 
concerns and bulldoze through to its intended objective.  End 
Summary. 
 
---------- 
The Manual 
---------- 
 
¶2.  (C) A draft of the government's manual for "streamlining 
the administrative process" for international NGOs has 
circulated publicly in Nicaragua, and immediately raised 
concerns that the Ortega administration seeks to silence 
civil society groups it views as opposition groups.  Specific 
language of concern in the manual includes: 
 
- Abstaining from participating in any political activities 
of a partisan character, including the use of the 
organization's resources, goods, and installations. 
- Abstaining from participating in activities that attempt to 
influence legislation. 
- Prior to receiving approval from the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs to operate in country, the organization needs to 
provide the list of projects it will conduct. 
- The Ministry of Foreign Affairs along with the foreign NGO 
will jointly audit ("fiscalizar") the distribution of the 
NGO's resources. 
- The foreign NGO's counterpart should be a legally 
established organization, and the funds cannot be used for 
partisan purposes. 
- The composition of professional or technical experts in the 
foreign NGO shall not be less than 90% Nicaraguan and foreign 
experts cannot be greater than 10%. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) While the manual is directed at international NGOs, 
local organizations are conscious they too will be affected. 
As a principal source of funding for many local associations, 
limiting the scope of work of international NGOs will have a 
direct effect on local organizations that work in the area of 
governance, elections, or similar "political" issues.  Luisa 
Molina, spokesperson for the Coordinadora Civil (a network of 
local NGOs), described the manual as the continuation of the 
government's persecution of civil society begun last fall 
(reftel).  Carlos Fernando Chamorro, president of the Center 
for Media Research (CINCO in its Spanish acronym) and a 
victim of the government's fall persecution, described the 
government manual as a tool the Ortega administration would 
use to limit the citizenry's freedom of association, freedom 
of mobilization, and freedom to affect or influence public

policy. 
 
-------------- 
It's Political 
-------------- 
 
¶4.  (C) Given the Ortega government's past interpretation of 
Nicaraguan law (reftel), an immediate concern from 
international and local NGOs is that the manual is political 
and will prohibit any projects in political party 
development, electoral assistance, the promotion of 
transparency and good governance, and many human rights 
issues.  Marcos Carmona, Executive Director of the Nicaraguan 
Permanent Commission for Human Rights (CPDH), stated that one 
of their internationally funded programs was to support 
municipal level committees that promote good governance and 
feared the new manual would essentially prohibit these 
activities.  Carmona's and others' fear that this manual is 
political in nature is well founded. 
 
¶5.  (C) Minister of Government Ana Isabel Morales told local 
media that the government wanted NGOs to provide social 
benefits to the population and stay out of politics.  Vice 
Foreign Minister Valdrack Jaentschke stated it more clearly. 
(Note: Jaentschke is the government's lead official 
responsible for the manual.)  According to the representative 
of a European NGO consulted by the government on the manual, 
Jaentschke told the NGO that the manual had a political 
purpose and not an administrative one.  The government, 
Jaentschke said, wanted NGOs to help with infrastructure 
products and stay out of issues such as governance.

Comment 
------- 
 
¶6.  (C) The Ortega administration has constantly viewed civil 
society groups as part of the opposition that attempts to 
"destabilize" the government.  As such it has always sought 
to limit these groups' activities by publicly discrediting 
them in government-affiliated media, harassing them 
administratively (e.g., sending tax inspectors to review 
files), or concocting trumped-up judicial charges (reftel). 
With the manual the government now seeks to formalize a 
process by which it can filter civil society's actions and 
eliminate any group or activity that will challenge the 
government's positions.  The response from foreign donors and 
civil society will now be instrumental in preserving the 
citizenry's ability to continue to have a say in its 
government.
