 Â¶1.  (SBU)  In a discussion with PolMinCouns on June 12, 
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Acting 
Director General for International Security Andre Giroux 
expressed appreciation for reftel views on Iran and Syria, 
and said that Canada had already been already planning to 
make a strong national statement regarding the need for 
"compliance and cooperation" from these governments during 
the upcoming IAEA Board of Governors' meeting.  He noted that 
Canada fully shares our concerns and supports our approach 
about these programs and the lack of cooperation by Iran and 
Syria.  "We are on the same page with you" on this issue, he 
confirmed.  He added that he had received a similar demarche 
earlier that day from diplomats representing Germany, the UK, 
and France, underscoring the "momentum" on dealing seriously 
with these concerns.
