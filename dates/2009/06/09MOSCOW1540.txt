SUMMARY 
------- 
 
1.(SBU) Russia's Ministry of Emergency Situations (EMERCOM) seeks to 
expand cooperation with the United States in international disaster 
response, emergency management, and other areas such as food aid. 
At a May 20th conference on Humanitarian Aid and at the Annual 
Meeting of the U.S.-Russia Joint Committee on Cooperation in 
Emergency Management and Disaster Response in March, EMERCOM's 
Director for International Activities, Yuri Brazhnikov, stated his 
interest in engaging with the United States on best practices, joint 
training, and on improving coordination in third countries on 
disaster response and humanitarian activities.  The Joint Committee 
Work Plan for 2009-2010 offers several opportunities in these areas 
and opens the door to work with EMERCOM to set priorities in the 
provision of humanitarian aid.  EMERCOM may also serve as a bridge 
to address other bilateral issues given, for example, its 
significant role in humanitarian aid operations in the North 
Caucasus and interest in cooperation with the Iowa National Guard. 
Post seeks Department and USAID support in identifying appropriate 
opportunities for cooperation with EMERCOM. 
 
2.(U) This is an action request. Please see paragraph 9. End 
Summary.

EMERCOM'S EXPANDING HUMANITARIAN OPERATIONS 
------------------------------------------- 
 
3.(SBU) The Director of EMERCOM's Department of International 
Activities, Yuri Brazhnikov, invited USAID to present at a May 20th 
Conference in Moscow on the topic of USG humanitarian aid operations 
and U.S.-Russia cooperation under the U.S.-Russia Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) on Cooperation in Emergency Management and 
Disaster Response.  A USAID representative outlined USAID's core 
capabilities and role in providing USG disaster relief and 
humanitarian aid, and also described the areas outlined in the joint 
Work Plan where the U.S. and Russia could expand cooperation. 
Brazhnikov noted that EMERCOM's international operations (combined 
humanitarian aid operations and disaster response) exceeded $100 
million in 2008.  EMERCOM had operations in Tajikistan, Armenia, 
Ethiopia, Kenya, Bangladesh, Somalia, Afghanistan, and other 
countries in 2008, as well as participating in the international 
response to the China earthquake.  He also drew special attention to 
Russia's cooperation with the U.S. and efforts to exchange best 
practices.  Over 350 participants attended the conference from 
EMERCOM, other Russian ministries, the UN High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR), the World Food Program (WFP), and the 
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. 
UNHCR noted that EMERCOM currently has an MOU with UNHCR for 
providing airlift and other transportation services, one of only 
approximately 15 countries to have such an agreement.  The WFP 
stated that food aid from Russia is on the rise through an 
arrangement whereby Russia provides funding to WFP and in exchange 
WFP agrees to procure food commodities and transportation services 
from EMERCOM. 
 
4.(SBU) EMERCOM also invited USAID to observe a May 22 large-scale 
field exercise involving 2500 EMERCOM staff at EMERCOM's 179 Rescue 
Center in Noginsk.  The Ministry of Internal Affairs and EMERCOM 
conducted joint operations to address a devastating earthquake and 
hostage rescue, evacuating victims from the disaster using small 
aircraft.  During the exercise, EMERCOM also simulated responses to 
a burning oil tank scenario and a fire in a road tunnel.  The 
exercise was carried out by approximately 20 aircraft, including 
several Ilyushin-76, Be-200, MI-26 and other aircraft of EMERCOM 
Russia.  The exercise showcased a hypothetical joint response with 
members of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and included search 
and rescue and chemical management teams from China and Kazakhstan. 
While EMERCOM staff told USAID that the event was preceded by 
extensive preparations and practical joint exercises, May 22 had a 
strong public relations appearance, with over 100 media 
representatives present, along with EMERCOM Minister Sergey Shoigu, 
Presidential Administration Head Sergei Naryshkin, and Federal 
 
MOSCOW 00001540  002.2 OF 003 
 
 
Security Service Director Alexander Bortnikov. 
 
5.(SBU) EMERCOM's growing role in international operations dates to 
Decree 1010 of the Government of the Russian Federation of October 
13, 1995, which established a National Structure for Emergency 
Humanitarian Response to coordinate the provision of bilateral 
emergency humanitarian assistance in foreign countries, and through 
the United Nations.  This response structure includes an Operational 
Group appointed by EMERCOM's Minister and under the control of 
EMERCOM, EMERCOM's Aviation Division and Air-mobile Rescue Squad 
(TsentroSpas), and the Agency to Promote and Coordinate Russian 
Participation in International Humanitarian Operations (EMERCOM 
Agency) under the Ministry.  EMERCOM also has several specialist 
divisions such as mine and unexploded ordnance detection.  In 
November 2008, EMERCOM announced plans to seek certification from 
the International Search and Rescue Advisory Group (INSARAG) of the 
United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs 
(OCHA) to bring its Air-Mobile Rescue Squad into compliance with 
international practices, enabling it to participate in field-level 
coordination among INSARAG certified teams.  The qualification 
exercise is planned for 2011, and Russia actively sought U.S. 
assistance to prepare for the exercise during the March 2009 meeting 
of the U.S.-Russia Joint Committee (the U.S. is one of only a select 
number of countries to have Heavy INSARAG certified teams).

U.S.-RUSSIA WORK PLAN FOR 2009-2010 
----------------------------------- 
 
6.(SBU) Members of the U.S.-Russia Joint Committee on Cooperation in 
Emergency Management and Disaster Response met in New York March 
24-25 to develop their Work Plan for 2009-2010.  Annual meetings to 
set priorities and develop work plans are held in accordance with 
the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in 1996 and extended 
for an additional 10 years in 2007.  Organized by FEMA, the meeting 
was also attended by EMERCOM, USAID/Russia, Iowa National Guard, and 
the U.S. Department of Transportation.  Opportunities for 
cooperation, joint training, exchanges, and improved coordination 
were discussed in the areas of disaster response (focusing on 
international deployments to third countries), emergency management, 
food and humanitarian aid operations, information exchange, and 
other exchanges between the U.S. and Russia. 
 
7.(SBU) In a meeting with the USAID/Russia Mission Director on May 8 
with EMERCOM International Activities department head Brazhnikov, 
USAID elaborated on specific elements (see next paragraph) of the 
2009-2010 Work Plan.  Brazhnikov expressed strong support for USAID 
proposals, especially the need to identify sites for potential third 
country joint observational exercises or projects.  He also spoke at 
length about successful examples of U.S.-Russia coordination in 
responding to international disasters, such as the Pakistan 
earthquake and Southeast Asia tsunami, and the need for 
strengthening those linkages to facilitate cooperation during future 
disaster response efforts. 
 
8.(SBU) USAID/Russia, in cooperation with DHS/FEMA and other members 
of the Joint-Committee, intends to undertake the following 
activities under the joint work plan: 
 
(A) In the area of Improved International Disaster Response 
Coordination, USAID/Russia will work with FEMA and other agencies to 
facilitate the exchange of technical experts between the U.S. and 
Russia to: (1) observe and discuss international disaster response 
policy and implementation mechanisms; (2) see best 
practices/mitigation efforts in practice (e.g. INSARAG certified 
teams); (3) view systems for coordinating global response; and (4) 
establish professional ties between international disaster response 
specialists from U.S. and Russian agencies.  In addition, FEMA is 
working closely with EMERCOM and USAID to plan and execute a 
table-top exercise (TTX) focused on an international disaster 
response scenario in the summer of 2010.  The TTX will compare and 
contrast U.S. and Russian experiences and approaches to handling 
large scale international disasters.  These actions will help 
prepare Russia for its INSARAG qualification exercise, a critical 
step in Russia's efforts to improve its capacity to coordinate with 
other INSARAG certified teams and the United States when disasters 
occur.

(B) In the area of Enhanced Capabilities and Field-level 
Coordination of International Food Aid Program Administration and 
Management, EMERCOM has suggested a joint seminar on food security 
and humanitarian aid to: (1) examine the underlying causes of food 
insecurity (Access, Availability, Utilization); (2) explore various 
delivery mechanisms, working with non-governmental organizations; 
and (3) discuss supplydQOEoQ*z}Qjects.  EMERCOM is already making sizable humanitarian aid 
contributions to Afghanistan.  Increased cooperation with the USG 
will help to improve the effectiveness of that assistance while 
introducing valuable development practices to the GOR, such as the 
use of non-governmental organizations to distribute humanitarian 
assistance. 
 
(C) In the area of Improved Information Exchange to Forecast 
Disasters and Coordinate Response, USAID/Russia suggested the 
establishment of informal protocols to facilitate information 
exchange on disaster forecasting systems, such as the Famine Early 
Warning System, and on disaster response efforts, generally.

COMMENT: 
-------- 
 
9.(SBU) EMERCOM's increasing participation in international 
humanitarian missions, its civilian-military structure and 
functions, and the political longevity of its Minister make it a 
unique Russian government agency.  EMERCOM's enthusiastic outreach 
to USG counterparts and its depoliticized, business-like approach to 
cooperation make it a potentially good partner for the U.S. in 
addressing shared challenges effectively in the region.  Post 
requests S/CRS, EUR, and USAID Bureau for Democracy Conflict and 
Humanitarian Assistance support in identifying specific options for 
collaborating with the Government of Russia in the areas outlined 
above and welcomes other recommendations.
