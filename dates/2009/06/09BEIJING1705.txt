CHINA CHANGES H1H1 REPORTING AND NOTIFICATION 
---------------------- ---------------------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) The Ministry of Health (MOH) has scaled back its H1N1 
reporting system.  As of June 21, MOH now only requires daily case 
tallies from the Health Departments in the municipalities and 
provinces and no longer requires case-by-case reporting.  MOH 
notification to Embassy Beijing now reflects this new reporting 
system (as of June 21), providing only daily counts of confirmed 
cases.  According to MOH, specific information about foreigners will 
be provided to appropriate consulates in the region though the local 
Foreign Affairs Offices (FAO). 
 
 
441 CASES OF 2009 A/H1N1 CONFIRMED 
-------------------- ------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) As of COB June 23, China's Ministry of Health (MOH) has 
officially communicated information about 441 confirmed cases of 
infection by the novel 2009 influenza A/H1N1. Confirmed cases have 
been detected in 16 provinces and the municipalities of Beijing, 
Chongqing, Shanghai and Tianjin. Of the 441 confirmed cases, MOH 
reported that as of June 22, 227 infected patients had recovered and 
been released from treatment.  The remaining 214 are being treated 
in isolation at local designated hospitals. 
 
 
CONCERNS OVER UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN IN QUARANTINE 
----------------------- -------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In response to concerns from Amcit parents about children 
being separated from them upon being placed in quarantine, HHS 
Attache intervened via MOH contacts to facilitate allowing an 
H1N1-negative parent to stay with his 13 year-old child at Ditan 
Hospital in Beijing. Under current hospital regulations, only minors 
under age 10 are allowed to be accompanied by one of the parents 
during hospitalization.  HHS Attache's MOH contacts reported that 
MOH cannot change the hospital's policy by increasing the age cut 
off to 18, but they did agree to facilitate on a case-by-case basis. 
 
 
 
TRAVEL ALERT FOR U.S. CITIZENS 
-------------- --------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Due to the increasing numbers of quarantine cases of 
American citizens, and also increasing concerns and complaints from 
Amcits about quarantine procedures and conditions, on June 19 Post 
sent a cable requesting that the Bureau of Consular Affairs (CA) 
issue a travel alert for China (REF A). CA posted a travel alert 
later that same day. 
 
 
EPA OFFICIAL IN QUARANTINE IN BEIJING 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) An EPA official who arrived in Beijing on June 20 to 
participate in a workshop hosted by the Ministry of Agriculture this 
week was quarantined on June 21, because a passenger sitting near 
him on the plane (UA 897 from Dulles) was confirmed with H1N1.  He 
is currently under observation at a designated quarantine hotel and 
is scheduled to be released from quarantine on June 27 or possibly 
earlier. Post has been direct contact with both the official and his 
family in the United States.
