  Editorial Quotes

¶1. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
a. "U.S. needs China vs. China needs the U.S." 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao) (06/09): "U.S. officials and economic personnel 
have frequently visited China.  They all have similar attitudes 
concerning avoiding aggression and using caution surrounding 
sensitive topics.  Their frequent visits indicate that the 
U.S.-China relationship is changing.  The U.S. is changing their old 
style whereby the U.S. pressures and China reacts. The U.S. 
economy's reliance on China far exceeds China's demand on the U.S. 
China is the only existing large-scale import market that is still 
growing.  It holds the most foreign exchange reserves and is also 
the largest economic body.  Having good economic relations with 
China has the lowest opportunity cost and the largest potential 
interest.  In 2009, it is very important to the U.S. that the 
Chinese economy is maintained as it is a huge market for the U.S. 
Because China purchased a large amount of American bonds, if the 
U.S. financially collapses, China will be influenced.  However, the 
reliance between the two countries is unbalanced.  If this happens, 
China only loses USD $1 trillion in assets, but the U.S. loses its 
financial hegemony which it has worked for over the last 60 years. 
Because of this situation, it is beneficial for China to deal with 
the U.S.-China relationship in a better and more appropriate way." 
 
b. "The U.S. claims that its sensitive technologies have been leaked 
to China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(06/08): "A Chinese Military Expert has said 
that the so-called sensitive technologies are very funny because it 
really isn't sensitive.  China received the guided missile 
technology long ago.  Today, some of China's technologies are even 
more advanced than the U.S.  China does not have to spy on other 
people's technology.  Certain U.S. departments, different times, 
talk about China's technology theft and spying.  Some departments 
have ulterior motives. When they want to make trouble they play 
their China card.  Even if the sensitive technologies of the U.S. 
have been leaked, it can only prove that there is ineffective 
supervision of weapons technology in the U.S.  According to the U.S. 
Justice Department, 43% of related cases have been suspected of 
involving China or Iran in illegally transferring weapons parts and 
technology." 
 
¶2. NORTH KOREA 
 
"On the North Korean issue, it is not necessary for China to take 
the lead" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(06/09): "There is a surprising turn in the 
North Korean issue.  The true nature of the North Korean nuclear 
issue is an issue between the U.S. and North Korea.  The world seems 
to have turned it into an issue between China and North Korea on 
purpose.  This insinuation changes the substance of the conflict and 
it is not beneficial for China.  This shows that the western 
countries' perspective is to 'hit two birds with one stone' because 
they could hit China and North Korea at the same time.  On this 
issue, China should avoid taking the lead.  China doesn't need to 
take any international responsibility if it doesn't feel like it or 
is incapable of taking.  China should not take the side of western 
countries and sanction North Korea.  An all-around sanction on North 
Korea may arouse North Korea's hatred of China.  If China pushes 
North Korea in order to compromise with the U.S., North Korea may 
turn on the west. A humanitarian crisis may occur if North Korea 
refuses to compromise.  If this happens, the west will still 
criticize China.  It is enough for China to try and persuade North 
Korea, telling the country that possessing nuclear weapons doesn't 
mean absolute security and doesn't lead to nuclear weapons 
development by its neighbor countries. The world is insecure about 
North Korea."
