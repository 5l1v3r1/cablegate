SUBJECT: NSA JONES DISCUSSES DEMOCRACY AT THE IEC 
 
¶1.  On June 23, National Security Advisor James Jones 
attended an elections roundtable at the Independent Election 
Commission (IEC).  Participants included the Ambassador, 
Ambassador Carney, IEC Chairman Dr. Azizullah Lodin and three 
other commissioners, IEC Chief Electoral Officer Dr. Daoud 
Najafi, UN Development Program (UNDP) Elect Chief Electoral 
Advisor Margie Cook, Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) 
Chairman Grant Kippen, Commissioner Fahim Hakim, and many 
supporting members of the organizations.  Dr. Lodin chaired 
the roundtable, which concluded with Jones emphasizing to the 
media that the United States impartially supports the choices 
of the Afghan people, and that Ambassador Eikenberry's 
meetings with candidates is in line with implementing the 
President's policy.

Elections are the Lifeblood of Democracy

¶2.  Lodin opened the event by remarking that elections are 
the lifeblood of a democracy and critical to the future of 
Afghanistan, applauding Jones' visit at this important time. 
Noting the progress made by the IEC since its formation in 
2007, he asserted that now the IEC is a lead actor in 
strengthening the democratic process in Afghanistan.  He 
thanked the international community, particularly the UNDP, 
for its support and affirmed the IEC would do its best to 
provide a good election to the Afghan people. 
 
¶3.  Jones applauded the IEC and ECC on their efforts, 
commenting that the world pays attention to elections and 
will be watching on August 20.  He assured the IEC that the 
United States and the international community support its 
efforts to provide the credible, inclusive and secure 
election to which the Afghan people are entitled, noting 
logistical obstacles should not prevent a process worthy of 
Afghanistan's proud history or bright future.  Jones stated 
that the elections also present the Afghan people with a 
tremendous opportunity to make their voices heard and show 
their leaders the way forward for the country.  It is also a 
chance for Afghan electoral institutions to demonstrate their 
effectiveness and credibility.

Supporting the choice of the Afghan People

¶4.  After brief presentations from the ECC on their 
operations and from the IEC on the current status of election 
planning, the event opened to questions from the press. 
Jones reiterated the importance of supporting fair and 
credible elections that reflect the will of the Afghan people 
and that the United States neither supports nor opposes any 
legitimate candidate, but encourages a 
level playing field for all candidates.  He noted that the 
U.S. wants to support stability and legitimate government in 
Afghanistan and will work with the chosen leader of the 
Afghan people.  In response to a question about the 
Ambassador's meetings with leading opposition candidates, 
Jones noted that the meetings were consistent with U.S. 
policy to allow voters access to candidates and media, and 
that it is consistent with how the U.S. approaches elections 
in other nations. 
 
¶5.  This message has not been cleared by the party.
