REF: 08 SURABAYA 098 
 
¶1.  Summary:  Supervisory Consular Officer (SCO) Terry Mobley 
visited Bali from June 8 - 9 to conduct the annual Consular 
Agency management review.  During the visit, SCO and outgoing 
Bali-based Consular Agent Joshua Finch and newly hired Consular 
Agent Joseph Curtin reviewed Consular Agency operations. 
Consular Agent Finch, who will resign his position on June 17 to 
join the Foreign Service, and Consular Assistant Harimala, have 
done an outstanding job addressing the needs of a large and 
growing American citizen population in Bali.  All goals 
established for the Consular Agency during the 2008 management 
review have been achieved.  The primary goals/activities 
established for this year include arranging required consular 
training for the newly hired Consular Agent, organizing crisis 
management exercises for Consular Agency personnel, and 
obtaining the equipment necessary to begin accepting consular 
fee payments by credit card at the Consular Agency.  End Summary 
 
Management Review 
----------------------- 
¶2.  SCO Mobley visited the Consular Agency in Bali from June 8 - 
9 to conduct the annual management review.  Consular Agent Finch 
will resign from his position on June 17 in order to depart for 
Washington to begin A-100 and a new career as a Consular 
Officer.  SCO met with outgoing Consular Agent Finch and newly 
hired Consular Agent Curtin.  SCO conducted a formal cash count 
with both Consular Agent Finch and Consular 
Assistant/sub-cashier Harimala and reviewed their work 
requirements.  SCO and Consular Agent Finch conducted an 
inventory of accountable consular items and reviewed the Office 
of Inspector General (OIG) checklist for Consular Agencies.  SCO 
transferred the operating cash advance and accountability for 
accountable consular items from Consular Agent Finch to Consular 
Agent Curtin during the visit.  Basic training was provided to 
Consular Agent Curtin in regard to providing emergency American 
citizen services, citizenship and passport services, proper 
storage of controlled items, storage of protected sensitive 
information, as well as general office procedures and security. 
Additionally, required ethics training and a copy of "Standards 
of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch" were 
provided to Consular Agent Curtin.  Consular Agent Curtin has 
completed the Cyber Security Awareness course and will enroll in 
and complete the online Consular Fee Collection course before 
Consular Agent Finch's June 17 departure. 
 
Completed Improvements and Activities 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶3.  Following the annual Consular Agency management review visit 
in 2008, SCO and Consular Agent Finch agreed on several planned 
activities and areas for improvement (Ref A).  During the past 
eleven months, those goals have been successfully addressed, 
including:  development of a simple crisis response plan and 
contact list for use in responding to natural disasters, plane 
crashes, ferry sinkings, and terrorist incidents, procurement of 
a satellite telephone for the Consular Agency, development of 
additional standard operating procedures (SOPs) for routine 
American citizen services, consultations in Surabaya for both 
the Consular Agent and LES Consular Assistant, first aid 
training for Consular Agency staff provided by the Embassy's 
Medical Unit, and improvements to the Consular Agency's web page 
and inclusion of that page as a subsection of Consulate General 
Surabaya's web site. 
 
Planned Improvements and Activities 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  Based on SCO's review of the Consular Agency and discussions 
with both outgoing Consular Agent Finch and incoming Consular 
Agent Curtin, the following activities are planned for the 
coming months: 
 
--Order the equipment necessary to begin accepting consular fee 
payment by credit card at the Consular Agency. 
 
--Order replacement American flags for display at the Consular 
Agency. 
 
--Organize a crisis management exercise in coming months. 
 
--Arrange a time for the new Consular Agent and LES Consular 
Assistant to visit Surabaya and Jakarta for consultations. 
 
--Enroll the new Consular Agent in the American citizen services 
and Passport and Nationality portions of an upcoming Basic 
Consular course at the National Foreign Affairs Training Center. 
 
--Prepare to replace the existing ACRS SAV unit with the spare 
(existing unit has a minor issue that CA support has not yet 
 
SURABAYA 00000059  002 OF 002 
 
 
been able to resolve). 
 
--Consider adding a combination lock to both the Consular 
Agent's office door as well as the door to the primary Consular 
Agency workspace (currently key locks are in use).
