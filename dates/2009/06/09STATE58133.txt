SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 050155869 
 
REF: A. 06 SINGAPORE 3391 
     ¶B. 06 JAKARTA 13362 
     ¶C. BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 2006 
 
¶1. (U) This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-5. 
 
¶2. (U) The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on application 050155869 for the export 
of aircraft spare parts to Indonesia via Singapore.  Post is 
requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days. 
 Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending 
and future applications involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Reason for request:  several irregularities and 
questions raised by the application's supporting 
documentation.  A Blue Lantern check conducted in fall 2006 
(refs A and B) confirmed relationships among foreign 
consignees Master Logistics and PT Mandira Jaya Abadi and 
foreign end-user the Indonesian Air Force.  However, that 
check also revealed several irregularities and a lack of 
knowledge about U.S. export control laws and regulations by 
the foreign parties.  The documentation submitted in support 
of this application, which is for a significantly larger 
order of United States Munitions List (USML) items than in 
previous licenses, suggests that many of these problems and 
ignorance of legal requirements continues to exist.  For 
example, it is unclear why Singaporean consignee Master 
Logistics is involved in this transaction if the Indonesian 
Air Force is purportedly ordering the parts directly from 
U.S. applicant Merex Inc. 
 
¶4. (U) Posts should make appropriate inquiries with the 
companies and with appropriate host government authorities to 
determine the exact roles of the foreign consignees, to 
verify their bona fides, and to confirm the legitimacy of the 
proposed transaction.  The following questions are provided 
as suggested guidance.
