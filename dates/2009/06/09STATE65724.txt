¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see para 2. 
 
¶2. (SBU) ACTION: Posts are to rescind all invitations that 
have been extended to Iranian diplomats for July 4th events. 
Unfortunately, circumstances have changed, and participation 
by Iranian diplomats would not be appropriate in light of the 
unjust actions that the President and I have condemned.  For 
invitations which have been extended, posts should make clear 
that Iranian participation is no longer appropriate in the 
current circumstances.  For invitations which have not been 
extended, no further action is needed. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The United States condemns the violence, suppression 
of peaceful demonstrations, and the unwarranted arrests that 
have taken place in Iran.  We have made it clear that the 
United States respects the sovereignty of the Islamic Republic 
of Iran and is not interfering with Iran's affairs.  But we 
will not turn a blind eye to Iran's treatment of its citizens, 
and will continue to monitor the events that take place in 
Iran.  The President has made clear that U.S. concerns over 
Iran's nuclear program, its support for terrorism, and abuse 
of human rights remain unchanged. We have offered Iran a path 
to address the concerns of the international community.  It is 
up to Iran to take advantage of that path. As the President 
said, if the Iranian government seeks the respect of the 
international community, it must respect universal human 
rights and heed the will of its own people. 
 
¶4. (U) For additional guidance, please contact the Office of 
Iranian Affairs at (unclassified) NEA-Iran-DC-DL@state.gov or 
(classified) NEA-Iran-DC-DL@state.sgov.gov. 
 
¶5. (U) Minimize considered.
