SUBJECT: SUPREME COURT RULING ON ZUMA CASE SPARKS REACTIONS 
 
REF: PRETORIA 47 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: The South African Supreme Court's January 12 
judgment allowing corruption charges against Jacob Zuma to 
move forward drew various reactions from across the political 
landscape.  African National Congress (ANC) alliance parties 
expressed their continued support for ANC President Jacob 
Zuma, with some pro-Zuma voices reviving the notion of a 
conspiracy against their candidate.  Opposition parties 
welcomed the decision and some questioned Zuma's suitability 
as a presidential candidate.  The ANC itself, as reported 
reftel, vigorously maintains that nothing has changed and 
that Zuma will be South Africa's next president.  End summary.

The ANC Alliance:  Zuma Remains Our Choice 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) The ANC Youth League, following the text of the ANC's 
statement, has simply taken note of the court decision and 
has, uncharacteristically, declined further comment.  The 
Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South 
African Communist Party (SACP) also voiced respect for the 
court but maintained that the decision to prosecute Zuma was 
politically motivated.  Both COSATU and SACP expressed doubt 
that Zuma will receive a fair trial.

DA and ID Await Zuma's Day in Court 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Both the Democratic Alliance (DA) and the Independent 
Democrats (ID) urged the National Prosecuting Authority to 
continue its case against Zuma without delay, adding that 
Zuma must clear his name.  Helen Zille, leader of the DA, 
said that if Zuma is to honor the ANC platform's pledge to 
fight against corruption in its ranks, he should renounce his 
candidacy for president.

Faith in the System Restored ? 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4. (U) The Inkatha Freedom Party said the ruling had restored 
faith in the country's judicial system.  The breakaway ANC 
party, the Congress of the People (COPE), welcoming the 
ruling, charged that former President Thabo Mbeki had  been 
removed from office for no reason.
