Emboff presented the reftel points to Czech MFA UN Department 
officer Milan Kunar on December 22. He thanked us for these 
details and noted that as his office was thinly staffed over 
the holidays, he would provide our details to the appropriate 
officer within his department as well as the MFA Middle East 
department.  Kunar also acknowledged that while there are 
many worthy causes that the Czechs would like to support 
financially, the Czech MFA has limited resources.  He 
promised that they would be back in touch, if they had 
additional comments.
