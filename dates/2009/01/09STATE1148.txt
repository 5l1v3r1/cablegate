SUBJECT: UPCOMING REGIONAL SECURITY INITIATIVE CONFERENCES: REQUEST 
FOR CT PROPOSALS TO BE CONSIDERED FOR FUNDING 
 
¶1. THIS IS AN ACTION REQUEST - see para 6. 
 
¶2. BACKGROUND: Regional Strategic Initiative (RSI) meetings will 
take place in the near future for the Iraq and Neighbors and Eastern 
Mediterranean RSIs. RSIs bring together key Washington 
decision-makers, ambassadors in the field, and representatives of the 
inter-agency to analyze the common threat and develop 
regionally-focused measures and programs for combating terrorism. To 
accomplish this objective, and to encourage regionally-based 
cooperation, S/CT makes resources available through three programs: 
¶1. the Counterterrorism Visitor Program, 2. the Ambassadors Fund for 
Counterterrorism, and 3. DS/ATA training programs funded by S/CT(all 
ATA programs implemented by DS are S/CT funded) resources. S/CT will 
consider proposals that support findings from RSI meetings, the goals 
of the National Implementation Plan, and the Deputies 
Committee-approved regional guidance strategies (found at 
www.intelink.sgov. gov/wiki/Portal:Counterterrorism). Programs 
should promote regional objectives and should support multilateral 
counterterrorism initiatives as a priority. In addition, since all 
of the funds come from the NADR account, proposals must have a law 
enforcement nexus. 
 
¶3. The Counterterrorism Visitor Program (CTVP) can bring up to ten 
visitors to the United States for ten days to participate in programs 
tailored for the selected participants. Goals of the CTVP are to 
build and strengthen regional CT networks; build CT networks across 
societal and well as governmental sectors; and build CT networks 
across public and private spheres. For instance, in 2008 we brought 
CT experts from Latin America to the U.S. for several weeks of 
meetings. 
 
¶4. The Ambassadors Fund for Counterterrorism provides micro-grants 
(up to $50,000 each) to Embassies for programs and activities that 
apply the tools of soft power to assist law enforcement efforts to 
counter violent extremism. FY08 programs supported a range of 
activities to include networking law enforcement with other community 
organization to assist with countering violent extremism; enhancing 
appreciation for the rule of law and respect for law enforcement 
among at-risk youth; and supporting law enforcement de-radicalization 
activities (please review the list of successful proposals at: 
https://www. intelink.gov/wiki/Countering_Violent_Extremis m.) 
 
¶5. NADR Anti-Terrorism Assistance funding (ATA) can be used to 
provide a variety of training courses and consultations in 
disciplines as varied as VIP Protection Training, Identification and 
Seizure of Digital Evidence, and Underwater Explosives Incident 
Countermeasures. ATA offers over 40 courses in a wide variety of 
antiterrorism skills, and DS/T/ATA has the capability to develop 
training and support packages tailored to specific bilateral and 
regional needs. Course listings and program manager contact 
information can be found listed in the DS website under ATA. 
 
¶6. Action Request: Ambassadors attending the upcoming RSIs are 
requested to present proposals for funding. In preparation, the RSI 
coordinator in regions can take the lead in working with relevant 
country team members and other standing coordinating bodies, such as 
the law enforcement working group or the counter-terrorism working 
group, to propose projects for funding. Proposed projects should 
fall under one of the three accessible programs: 
 
-- the Counterterrorism Visitor Program 
-- Ambassadors Fund for Counterterrorism 
-- DS/ATA training programs 
 
In order to be considered for funding, proposals must be regional 
initiatives involving at least two countries. 
 
¶7. Post should submit proposals for funding in a front channel cable 
to S/CT. Proposals should include: 
 
-- Title of project. 
-- Implementing agency or organization. 
-- Description of program, to include timeline for implementation, 
target audience, stated objectives, and how it supports law 
enforcement. 
-- Coordinating office within the Embassy responsible for oversight 
of implementation. 
-- Embassy point of contact and identification of who will receive 
and execute the contract or grant assistance. 
 
¶8. S/CT, in coordination with RSI Officers when possible, will review 
proposals and assign funding by priority. Once programs have been 
approved, S/CT will provide instructions to Post to proceed with 
solicitations and will provide fiscal data upon the receipt of a 
vehicle for implementation (MOU, grant document, etc.) and 
appropriate notification to Congress. Note: S/CT can assist with 
Washington-based implementing agencies, but does not have authority 
to provide Washington-based grants. 
 
¶9. Point of contact for these requests is S/CT Deputy Director for 
Regional Affairs, Marc Norman, (202) 647-8911, normanme@state.gov. 
Department appreciates Posts' responses to this action request.
