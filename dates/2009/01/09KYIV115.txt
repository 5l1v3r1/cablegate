REF:  2008 STATE 129940 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  Embassy Kyiv requests $10,711.00 for public 
outreach to support USG trade and development policy positions on 
biotechnology.  Ukraine has been listed as a "key" country for 
biotechnology engagement in FY 2009.  Given Ukraine's robust 
agricultural sector and proximity to EU market influences, Embassy 
Kyiv proposes further advocacy of the benefits of biotechnology and 
science-based regulatory systems among policymakers, scientists, and 
journalists.  Post plans to translate and disseminate peer-reviewed 
scientific materials, as well as organize a speaker program that 
would include conferences, workshops, and media outreach in Kyiv, 
Dnipropetrovsk, and Odesa.  End summary. 
 
 
Scientific Roadshow 
------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Public apprehension towards biotechnology and transgenic 
foods in Ukraine results from persistent knowledge gaps and negative 
information campaigns.  However, concerns about the quality and 
long-term health implications of GMOs have not been adequately 
addressed by government regulators, scientific researchers, or the 
media.  In light of this, Post proposes to invite an American expert 
to Ukraine to conduct lectures, town hall meetings, and press 
events.  Ideally, s/he would possess expertise in human health, 
genetics, environmental science, plant varieties, and global market 
trends. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Post envisions a six-day "roadshow," with events in three 
regions:  Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, and Odesa.  These regions are 
important agricultural centers and also represent Embassy outreach 
priorities.  The National Agricultural University (NAU), with a main 
campus in Kyiv and 17 satellite campuses across Ukraine, has 
indicated its willingness to facilitate and host events. 
 
 
Translation of Articles into Local Language 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Eight out of ten articles in Ukrainian newspapers on 
biotechnology, according to one local contact, negatively portray 
GMOs.  These articles are often planted by officials who profit from 
fears of biotechnology.  Anti-GMO environmental groups funded in 
Europe have also published materials in local media.  Articles by 
Western scientists, using peer-reviewed data which debunks many GMO 
myths, are rarely translated into Russian or Ukrainian.  Post 
proposes two recent articles for translation and reproduction -- 
"The Real GM Food Scandal," by Dick Taverne, published in the 
November 2007 edition of Prospect Magazine, and an editorial in the 
December 2007 edition of Nature entitled "Another Inconvenient 
Truth" -- to be distributed during the "roadshow" and other outreach 
opportunities.  Recipients will include journalists, students at 
agricultural universities, university faculty, and scientific 
researchers.
