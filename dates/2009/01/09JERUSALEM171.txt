Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al Quds leads with news of intensive diplomatic efforts to stabilize 
the ceasefire in Gaza, while Israeli representative Gilad concluded 
talks in Cairo on January 22 and a Hamas delegation was expected to 
soon arrive for talks on the ceasefire.  The paper comments that 
Egypt, unlike previously, now expects parties to sign ceasefire 
agreement documents.  Al Quds front pages and Al Ayyam and Al Hayat 
Al Jadida lead with statements by President Obama calling for the 
reopening of Gaza crossings to facilitate humanitarian assistance 
and commerce, and calling on Hamas to recognize Israel.  Al Quds 
cites DPA in quoting a spokesperson at the US Embassy in Cairo 
denying on January 22 that the U.S. is conditioning assistance to 
Egypt on Egypt preventing arms smuggling into Gaza. 
 
All front pages highlight President Obama's naming of George 
Mitchell as Special Envoy for Middle East Peace, with Al Quds 
calling the move a positive sign of the seriousness of the new U.S. 
administration.  The three papers also report that Secretary of 
State Hillary Clinton called Palestinian Authority President Abbas 
on January 22 to express support for his efforts to achieve peace in 
the region, and to stress the need for reaching a 
Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement as quickly as possible.  In 
other presidential news, Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida highlight 
front page reports on President Obama fulfilling his promise to 
close, "the Guantanamo prison and prohibit violent interrogation 
methods."  Al Hayat Al Jadida runs a front page photo of Obama 
signing the closure document, while Al Quds runs a lengthy article 
on page 2 with a picture of Obama, surrounded by his staff, signing 
the document. 
 
Al Quds and Al Hayat Al Jadida run inside reports on the January 22 
meeting between U.S. Consul General Jake Walles and PLO chief 
negotiator Saeb Erekat.  Erekat is quoted urging the U.S. 
administration to act immediately to establish a Palestinian state. 
 
 
All front pages quote PLO Secretary General Yasir Abd Rabbuh 
announcing that the Palestinian Authority (PA) government headed by 
Prime Minister Fayyad, "has placed its fate into the hands of PA 
President Abbas," meaning that it will disband if necessary to 
facilitate national Palestinian dialogue on the formation of a 
national consensus government. 
 
On Gaza reconstruction, Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida's front 
pages run statements by Palestinian Authority Premier Fayyad stating 
that donor countries will meet next month in Egypt to discuss 
reconstruction.  All front pages report that Hamas will disburse 
$5,180 in compensation to Gazans affected by the "Israeli war on 
Gaza." 
 
Al Ayyam and Al Quds report of the reopening of smuggling tunnels 
across Gaza-Egypt borders, as Al Ayyam cites AFP in quoting Israeli 
Foreign Minister Livni stating that Israel retains the right to 
destroy the tunnels to prevent the rearming of Hamas.  The paper 
also reports that Egypt discovered three tunnels and arrested a 
Palestinian inside one of them.  In more Israel-related coverage, Al 
Quds' front page cites DPA in reporting that Israel has informed the 
EU of its consent to reopen Gaza crossings for the flow of 
humanitarian assistance.  The paper further reports, citing Israeli 
daily Yedeot Aharanot, that Israel is becoming more flexible in 
responding to Hamas demands for a prisoner exchange deal.  A 
spokesman for Palestinian militants is quoted calling the change, "a 
 
JERUSALEM 00000171  002 OF 002 
 
 
victory for resistance." 
 
Al Quds' front page, cites AFP in reporting that UK State Minister 
of African Affairs Mark Malloch-Brown has demanded an international 
investigation into the alleged Israeli use of phosphorus bombs in 
Gaza.  In related news, Al Ayyam's front page cites news agencies in 
quoting "Jewish" UN human rights rapporteur Richard Falk stating on 
January 22, that he believed that there were indications of Israeli 
war crimes having been committed in Gaza. 
 
In lead front page photo coverage, Al Quds runs a photo of a Gaza 
family sheltered in a tent beside the rubble of their destroyed 
house, next to a photo of a Palestinian walking inside a smuggling 
tunnel beneath the Gaza-Egypt border.  Al Hayat Al Jadida runs a 
photo of a young Gaza girl reading a school book atop the remains of 
a destroyed house.  The paper also front pages a photo of President 
Obama signing orders to close Guantanamo Bay detention camp.  Al 
Ayyam leads with two photos; a group of smiling children in Gaza and 
head shots of George Mitchell standing with President Obama. 
 
The three papers front page reports on the injury of seven Gazans by 
Israeli naval fire on January 22 and the death of two people 
previously injured in the "war on Gaza."  Al Ayyam's front page 
reports that Fatah sources claim that Hamas executed 17 Fatah 
"operatives" during the Israeli offensive on Gaza.------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Al Quds editorial is titled, "Internal division ... a major 
national catastrophe" (01/23):  "Differences, negative media 
campaigns and accusations of violations here and there, serve no 
o 
internal nor external purpose for Hamas nor for Fatah.  Rather, 
these acts entrench division and disarray... [Palestinian] national 
unity has become a demand, not only of the Palestinian people, but 
of the whole international community that is demanding 
reconciliation and the authority of the Palestinian Authority 
throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  It has become clear that 
Gaza reconstruction is contingent on Palestinian national unity." 
2) Mohamad Yaghy opines in Al Ayyam under the title "Gaza is 
victorious and in great need of peace" (01/23):  "Now that the war 
has ended, there is a need to declare the Rafah crossing, a 
Palestinian-Egyptian crossing governed by Egypt and the leadership 
of the Palestinian people.  This would pave the way for a new 
agreement, which could empower Egypt to reopen the crossing under 
new arrangements that would end the siege and it would serve as new 
leverage for the PLO leadership in any upcoming dialogue with 
Hamas."
