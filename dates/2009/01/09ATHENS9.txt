¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: Greek FM Dora Bakoyannis -- who became 
Chairman-in-Office of the OSCE on January 1 -- has also taken 
an activist role in the EU response to the Gaza crisis.  On 
January 4, she issued a statement criticizing Israeli ground 
operations in Gaza, calling for an immediate ceasefire, and 
urging consideration of deploying international observers in 
the region.  On Sunday, Bakoyannis also discussed 
developments with Palestinian Authority President Abbas and 
the Egyptian, Spanish, and French foreign ministers and is 
scheduled later today to call UK Foreign Secretary Miliband. 
Hyperbolic press reports are feeding the Greek public's anger 
over Gaza developments.  The Israeli and U.S. Embassies were 
the targets of large, sometimes violent, demonstrations on 
January 3 and 4.  Sixteen windows were broken in the U.S. 
Embassy Chancellery by rocks and other projectiles thrown by 
protesters.  We remained concerned about the potential for 
violence on January 9 during previously scheduled mass 
student protests and on January 12, the two-year anniversary 
of the RPG attack against the U.S. Embassy.  END SUMMARY. 
 
BAKOYANNIS AND GAZA 
------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) In her statement (the full text of which is 
reprinted below in para 7), Bakoyannis criticized Israeli 
ground operations in Gaza as a "very negative development," 
which would lead to a number of bad consequences and must be 
stopped immediately.  She said the operations would 
exacerbate the humanitarian crisis, increase instability and 
extremism in the wider region, and deal a serious blow to the 
peace process, which was the "only path to a solution." 
Bakoyannis went on to say that the international community 
could not be a passive observer to developments, and that the 
UN had a "pivotal role" to play in finding a solution. 
Echoing calls we have heard in the past from the MFA about 
sending peacekeepers or observers to Gaza, Bakoyannis said 
consideration must be given to deploying international 
observers in the region.  Finally, Bakoyannis urged 
implementation of the three-point policy (ceasefire, 
humanitarian aid and the peace process), which she claimed 
had been Greece's position from the start of the crisis, and 
which she had suggested to, and had been accepted by, the EU 
as its common position. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On January 4, Bakoyannis also made a number of phone 
calls to discuss the three-point policy with international 
leaders, including Palestinian Authority President Abbas and 
the foreign ministers of Egypt, Spain, and France.  She is 
scheduled later today to call UK Foreign Secretary Miliband. 
 
GREEK PRESS FEEDING ANGER 
------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) The Greek press has for the most part taken the 
Palestinian side on the Gaza crisis, and hyperbolic reports 
appear to be feeding the public's anger over developments. 
Nearly all papers have criticized the U.S. and the perceived 
pro-U.S. Czech EU Presidency for backing Israel in its 
continued action against "non-combatants and children."  Some 
headlines include: "Continuous Massacre with U.S. Backing" 
(Ta Nea), "Crime Against Humanity" (Eleftherotypia), "The 
American Fifth Column in Europe and the Attack against Gaza" 
(Eleftherotypia), and "Holocaust" (Apogevmatini).  Even 
serious papers, such as Kathimerini, which has printed 
contributions from the Israeli Amos Oz and others, and To 
Vima, which ran columns by both the Palestinian and Israeli 
envoys this weekend, strongly disapprove of the Israeli 
operation. 
 
U.S. EMBASSY DAMAGED BY PROTESTERS 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) On January 3 and 4, three to four thousand 
protesters, made up of Palestinians and other Arabs, as well 
as members of the new-left SYRIZA coalition and the Communist 
Party of Greece (KKE), targeted the U.S. and Israeli 
Embassies.  The protests began at the central Syntagma Square 
in front of Parliament, advanced the mile or so to the U.S. 
Embassy, then another approximately two miles to the Israeli 
Embassy.  Protesters hurled rocks and other projectiles at 
the American Embassy, breaking 16 windows in the Chancellery 
on Saturday.  Violence also broke out in front of the Israeli 
Embassy, where protesters set fires and police used tear gas 
to disperse the crowds.

¶6. (SBU) We remain concerned about the potential for violence 
directed against American officials and property on January 
9, when previously scheduled mass student demonstrations may 
combine with Gaza demonstrations.  We are also concerned 
about the possibility of an attack against the Embassy or 
U.S. personnel in connection with the two-year anniversary of 
the 2007 RPG attack, which occurs on January 12.  We will 
hold an Embassy EAC meeting January 7 to discuss and plan for 
developments.  The RSO and other agency offices remain in 
close contact with the Hellenic Police and the security 
services. 
 
BAKOYANNIS' GAZA STATEMENT 
-------------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) BEGIN TEXT OF FM BAKOYANNIS' JANUARY 4 STATEMENT ON 
GAZA: 
 
The ground operations in Gaza are a very negative 
development. They exacerbate the tragic humanitarian crisis. 
They exacerbate the dangerous instability in the wider 
region, strengthening unacceptable and extremist positions. 
They are dealing a serious blow to the prospects of the peace 
process, which is the only path to a solution. 
 
The international community cannot simply play the role of 
observer or commentator with regard to these developments. 
The UN Security Council has a pivotal role.  No more time 
must be lost.  The bloodshed must be stopped.  Violence is 
not the solution.  Ground operations must be stopped 
immediately and a ceasefire must be achieved. 
 
We need to see the implementation of the three-point policy 
(ceasefire, humanitarian aid, peace process) that has been 
Greece's position from the outset and was decided upon by the 
Foreign Ministers of the European Union on 30 December in 
Paris.  Serious consideration must also be given to the 
possibility of deploying an international presence -- 
international observers, for instance -- in the region.
