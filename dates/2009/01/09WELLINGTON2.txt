SUBJECT: U.S. COMPANIES AND AIR NEW ZEALAND TEST AVIATON BIOFUEL 
 
¶1. December 30, 2008 Charge represented the Embassy, the Foreign 
Commercial Service and the U.S. Government generally at an Air New 
Zealand (ANZ) test flight of a new biofuel at Auckland International 
Airport. UOP, a U.S. subsidiary of Honeywell, has developed a 
biofuel from a tree called jatropha in conjunction with Boeing, 
Rolls Royce, and ANZ. In this test, a 50/50 mixture of UOP's 
jatropha jet fuel and ordinary petroleum-based jet A fuel powered 
one engine on an ANZ 747 during the test flight. After about two 
hours of various tests, the engine and fuel were confirmed to 
function completely normally. (12/31/08 Embassy press clips, emailed 
to EAP/ANP, provide media reporting on the event.) 
 
¶2. The jatropha tree produces nuts which can be pressed to yield an 
oil which is then refined into jet fuel. It is designated a second 
generation biofuel because it does not displace any food crops or 
forest. The tree grows in semi-arid conditions. It can therefore be 
planted in areas of marginal use. Jennifer Holmgren, a chemist and 
General Manager at UOP, who represented her company at the test, 
said that there were plans to plant jatropha along the edge of the 
Gobi in a test to combat desertification. 
 
¶3. ANZ Chairman Rob Fife told those watching the test that the 
airline is now working with UOP, Boeing and Rolls Royce to assess 
whether it will be possible to grow jatropha trees and build a 
refining capability of sufficient scale to make the use of this 
50/50 blend commercially viable. If so, this could be a ground 
breaking development. Apparently, jatropha is the only second 
generation biofuel that could be commercially available as soon as 
the next three to five years. 
 
¶4. This test was a good reminder of the role that U.S. companies and 
their international partners play in combating climate change. It 
comes at an interesting moment in the development of alternative 
fuels. Other airlines, including Virgin Atlantic and Japan Airlines, 
are also engaged in testing biofuels, although ANZ may have the most 
ambitious and realistic approach to bringing such fuels on line. In 
addition, another NZ company, "Aquaflow Bionomic," announced in 
December 2008 that it had developed a process to refine Synthetic 
Paraffinic Kerosene (SPK) from wild algae, which could be blended 
with Jet A-1 fuel to power jet aircraft. The algae is found in local 
sewage oxidation ponds, and the company used a technology also from 
UOP. Second, December 22, 2008 New Zealand's new National Government 
passed through the Parliament a bill repealing the Biofuels 
Obligation Act (BOA), which the Labour Government had passed just 
prior to the November 2008 national elections. The law would have 
required the introduction of vehicles in New Zealand to be powered 
with a blend of biofuels with petrol and diesel effective October 1, 
2009.
