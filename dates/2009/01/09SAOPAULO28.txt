BREAKING WITH THE BUSH DOCTRINE 
 
Main Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (1-15) states: 
"...it is unmistakable the breaking [of Barack Obama's 
administration] with the "supremacismo" that traumatically marked 
U.S. behavior in the global arena during Bush years.  It's more than 
just a change in tone....what changes is the perception of the way 
the United States should promote its interests and its projection in 
the world....The power Hillary Clinton has in mind is another [than 
that of Condoleezza Rice's]. It is about 'smart power'....Her 
emphasis in describing the new face of the American foreign 
policy...contrasts with the general references [she made] to the 
present issues.  Even so, if worthy of note the reference an 
allusion to future diplomatic contacts to try to dissuade Iran from 
pursuing its nuclear program is of note....On the other hand,...she 
reiterated her opposition to negotiating with Hamas until it 
acknowledges Israel....As to Brazil, she signaled with a 'new 
energetic alliance (with Latin America), based in new technologies 
and sources of renewable energy'. It would be unrealistic to expect 
more than that".
