REF:  STATE 135076 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Reftel requested that post conduct a bona fides site visit 
to Zeltmann GmbH and a pre-license check on application 050136522. 
ConGen Pol-Econ Off conducted the site visit with junior directors 
Peter Zeltmann and Achim Zeltmann on January 14.  Established in 
1964 by current senior director Kurt Zeltmann, the company sells 
spare parts for military vehicles such as the M113, M109 and M60 and 
had an annual turnover of 2,698,671 euros in 2008. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Zeltmann does on occasion procure parts from other 
distributors to facilitate transactions to end users.  The company 
understands prohibitions of United States Munitions List (USML) in 
regards to stockpiling, re-transfers and re-exports.  95% of 
business is done domestically with providers to the Germany army, 
but the company also exports to companies and militaries in Italy, 
Spain, Turkey and other NATO members. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Zeltmann keeps accounts of its transactions.  It has 
supporting documentation for this transaction and all parts are 
going to Spain, although no contract has been signed.  Security at 
the facility is very modest as the company sells only spare parts. 
Two storage facilities are locked up at night but there are no 
cameras, security system, or guards.  Items are never stored 
offsite.  The Zeltmanns claim they have never experienced a robbery. 
 German export control officials from the Federal Office of 
Economics and Export Control (BAFA) conduct an inspection of the 
company every four years. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Zeltmann GmbH appears to be a reliable recipient of USML 
items. 
 
¶5.  This cable was coordinated with Embassy Berlin.
