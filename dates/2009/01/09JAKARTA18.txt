¶1.  (U) This message is Sensitive but Unclassified -- Please 
handle accordingly. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  In reftel, S/CT requested proposals under 
the FY-09 Regional Strategic Initiative.  Mission requests 
USD 300,000 in NADR funds to support the training of 
Indonesian personnel involved in the operation of NDAA 1206 
Regional Command Center coastal/shipboard surveillance radar 
systems.  This proposal would complement current 1206 
initiatives in the Straits of Malacca and the Sulawesi Sea 
regions and engage GOI elements in a joint interagency 
manner.  Details of the project proposal are provided in para 
five.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) In reftel, S/CT requested proposals under the FY-09 
Regional Strategic Initiative for counterterrorism programs. 
Mission appreciates this opportunity to present ideas and has 
a proposal for Department's review. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The project we propose focuses on the training of 
Indonesian personnel involved in the operation of National 
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) 1206 Regional Command 
Centers coastal/shipboard surveillance radar systems.  This 
proposal would complement current 1206 initiatives in the 
Straits of Malacca and the Sulawesi Sea regions.  The 
proposal would also expand Mission's ability to engage with 
Indonesian military and police in a joint interagency 
fashion.  The proposal--which is reviewed in detail 
below--would be implemented within the constraints of 
Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining and Related 
Projects (NADR) anti-terrorism funding as outlined in reftel 
and would fully support USG strategy in the region.  Mission 
requests $300,000 for this program. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Details on the proposal follow: 
 
-- Title of project:  Training of Indonesian personnel 
involved in the operation of NDAA 1206 Regional Command 
Center coastal and shipboard surveillance radar systems. 
 
-- Implementing agency or organization:  ODC, in 
collaboration with POL, RSO, DOJ, ICITAP, FBI, JIATF-W, ECON, 
USAID, as appropriate. 
 
-- Description of program, including timeline for 
implementation, target audience, and stated objectives: 
Through this program, Mission's Country Team would encourage 
the GOI to approach transnational threats in an interagency 
manner by funding the training, cost of living and transport 
of radar operators with subject-matter expertise involving 
critical radar locations in the Straits of Malacca by 4th 
quarter FY 2009 and the Sulawesi Sea by 2nd quarter FY 2010. 
(Note:  The 1206 coastal surveillance stations in the 
Sulawesi Sea will not be complete until the end of 2009.) 
The target audience would be junior local Indonesian 
officials from customs and immigration, fisheries, military, 
sea communications, marine police and drug enforcement.  The 
program would initially train ten personnel from each unit, 
approximately 60 people altogether.  To keep the training 
sessions at a manageable level, the selected participants 
would be divided into two groups, one in the east (Sulawesi 
Sea) and one in the west (Straits of Malacca).

The Sulawesi Sea and the Straits of Malacca are significant 
from a counterterrorism perspective.  Capacity- and 
skill-building in both locations is necessary to create a 
seamless surveillance system so that transnational criminals 
do not redirect their activities to more easily exploitable 
areas.  The proposal would increase the effectiveness of 
Indonesia's response to transnational threats by selecting 
personnel from appropriate agencies and increasing their 
skill sets and abilities for the specific purpose of radar 
surveillance.  This program would complement ongoing DoD, 
ICITAP, JIATF-W and USAID programs. 
 
The justification for funding centers on the GOI's inability 
to budget training of personnel throughout its archipelago. 
At the same time, the NADR funding enlarges the pool of skill 
sets from which to draw the appropriate expertise.  It would 
therefore complement and enhance the effectiveness of the 
existing NDAA Section 1206 program.  NDAA Section 1206 
supports emerging threats.  This proposal would provide 
training related to 1206 sites that was not authorized or 
envisioned when the 1206-funded radar program was originally 
developed.  (Note:  In 2006 and 2007, NDAA 1206 did not 
authorize the training of non-military personnel.  This was 
one of the reasons that none was foreseen.)  NADR funding 
would allow training and positioning of military and civilian 
expertise until the GOI was able do so for itself. 
 
-- Coordinating office within Mission responsible for 
oversight of implementation and assessing/reporting: 
Political Section, in concert with ODC. 
 
-- Results:  1206 Radar sites are manned and operated by 
trained personnel with expertise, experience and information 
on specific threats to key regions of the Indonesian 
archipelago. 
 
-- Mission point of contact and identification of who will 
receive and execute the contract or grant assistance: 
Mission,s primary point of contact will be LTC James 
Robinson and Mission,s secondary point of contact will be 
LTC Andy Marble, ODC.  Kate Rebholz of the Political Section 
is also involved in the project proposal.
