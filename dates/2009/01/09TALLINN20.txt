Â¶1. (U) On January 16, we delivered points in reftel to Juri 
Kahn, Division Director for Middle Eastern Affairs at the 
Estonian MFA.  Kahn confirmed that Estonia shares the view 
that weapons transfers into Gaza must be stopped and that 
the international community has a role to play in this 
field.  The Government of Estonia also feels that the 
blockade of Gaza should be removed and the borders should 
be open for movement of goods and people.  The GOE 
highlighted its interest in seeing the USG continue to play 
a key role in the process of bringing both parties together 
to form a sustainable peace. (Note:  Estonia does not have 
any embassies in the Middle East.  End Note.)
