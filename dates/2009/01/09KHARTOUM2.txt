STANCE ON GAZA IS AIDING SPREAD OF TERRORISM 
 
REF KHARTOUM 1842 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: On December 30, 2008, the Public Affairs Officer 
and Information Assistant visited, "Sudan Vision" Editor-in-Chief 
and former International Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP) 
participant Saif Adeen Elbashir Ahmed Hassan.  The purpose of the 
meeting was to discuss an upcoming PAS program on federalism in the 
United States. The meeting coincided with the second day of student 
demonstrations outside the U.S. and Egyptian embassies to protest 
the Israeli air-strikes in Gaza (reftel).  Focusing on the latter, 
Ahmed voiced what he said was his and the region's disappointment 
with the U.S. stance on the situation in Gaza.  He also called on 
the U.S. to take a more active role in the Darfur peace process. End 
Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Despite his newspaper's role as a mouth-piece for regime 
policies, Ahmed claims to be a "moderate."  As such, he told the PAO 
that "the U.S. has fallen way below the expectations of the people 
in the region and in Sudan in adopting its current stance on the 
Israeli offensive in Gaza."  He pointed out that he regards the U.S. 
as unequalled in fields as diverse as trade and humanitarian 
assistance.  Nevertheless, Ahmed claimed the failure of the 
Department of State to call upon Israel to stop "its offensive 
immediately" was harming the credibility of the U.S. in convincing 
other nations to cooperate in countering terrorism worldwide.  "Even 
moderate countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan, feel 
that in not asking Israel to halt the offensives immediately, the 
U.S. is failing its own position and that of the United Nations." 
Ahmed contended that the U.S. "is aiding the spread of terrorism 
worldwide," and that there is "a deepening rift developing between 
the U.S. and the Arab world." 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Sudan Vision's Editor-in-Chief then shifted to the 
situation in Darfur.  He asked rhetorically how the U.S. had been 
able to get the North and South to sign off on the 2005 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in Naivasha, but could not do 
the same in bringing the warring Darfur parties to the peace table. 
He said: "If the U.S. calls (Darfur rebel leader) Abdul Wahid Al-Nur 
to the table of negotiations, he will come unconditionally.  France 
cannot do that."  He continued: "There is a desire in Sudan for the 
U.S. to make a serious contribution to the power process in 
Darfur." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Ahmed contended that the "international powers" are "not 
in a hurry to achieve peace in Darfur. They will just fix their 
interests, and then launch accusations against the Sudanese 
government, the janjaweed and the militias."  Ahmed added that "As 
long as the U.S. distances itself from becoming directly involved in 
the peace negotiations and preparations for Darfur, no one accepts 
that there will be any success." Ahmed's concluded by saying: "Don't 
fail us or fall below our standards for you.  People see that Sudan 
can benefit from a good relationship with the United States." 
 
¶5. (U) Bio note: Ahmed was on the March-April 2006 NEA Foreign 
Policy Decision-Making Process IVLP tour, and has been the 
Editor-in-Chief of this pro-government English-language local daily 
since its establishment in 2003. He   entered the field of 
journalism in 1993 as an international affairs reporter, and has 
also worked as a foreign correspondent for two Doha-based 
newspapers.  The funding for "Sudan Vision" comes from 
pro-government private companies. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Comment: Ahmed's theme is a frequent one for many Sudanese, 
especially among the political elite. It is easier for them to focus 
on the widely reported suffering in Gaza (or Iraq) than on suffering 
caused by their own ruling government on their own people. The idea 
that the "U.S. could solve Darfur" is a popular one as well as it 
absolves local actors from all responsibility or urgency to do so 
themselves. End comment.
