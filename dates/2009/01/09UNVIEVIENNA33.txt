SUBJECT:  UNODC:Costa Welcomes Renewed Focus on Multilateral 
Diplomacy, Urges More Analysis of Organized Crime. 
 
REF: STATE 07023 
 
¶1. (SBU) In a candid January 27 review of upcoming priorities, UNODC 
Executive Director Antonio Costa described for Ambassador his 
interest in finding ways to better address the "transmission belt" 
of organized crime and smuggling that moves illegal drugs from 
producers to the markets.  Costa explained that UNODC has a good 
understanding of the drug addiction side of the equation, and has 
greatly strengthened its programs on the cultivation side -- but the 
area of drug trafficking and related organized crime is much more 
problematic.  We have good treaties, Costa continued, but 
implementation and monitoring are lagging.  There is, he argued, an 
"unexplained economy" worth billions that still needs to be broken. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Costa was very enthusiastic about the new US 
Administration's approach to multilateral diplomacy, noting that SG 
Ban Ki-Moon had been "overwhelmed" by the positive signals from his 
initial discussions with the Secretary and President regarding UN 
issues.  Responding to the Ambassador's highlighting of Secretary 
Clinton's confirmation comments on human trafficking, Costa noted he 
had reviewed the Questions For the Record and welcomed the continued 
US focus on this scourge.  Decrying the "knowledge crisis" regarding 
international human trafficking, Costa handed over an advance copy 
of the new UNODC human trafficking report. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Costa also used this discussion to flag the ongoing problem 
of insufficient resources for UNODC's General Purpose Fund.  Noting 
ample project specific funding, Costa explained that he may have to 
eliminate between "15 and 20" positions this year because of 
insufficient resources to oversee these slots on the UNODC 
management side. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In a private pull aside, Ambassador expressed US support 
for the candidacy of John Sandage (reftel) to be the head of UNODC's 
Treaty and Legal division.  Costa welcomed this signal, and noted 
his own enthusiasm for Sandage's work.
