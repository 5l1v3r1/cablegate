Poloff discussed the USG's opposition to Iran's candidacy for 
UNDP Executive Board President (reftel) with MFA Director of 
International Organization Affairs Azad Belfort January 8. 
Belfort said he had not been aware that Iran would be a 
candidate for the UNDP Executive Board presidency.  He added 
that he would seek additional information from the Haitian 
delegation in New York and then quickly inform the Minister 
of Foreign Affairs.  Belfort said he could not guarantee 
Haiti would oppose Iran's candidacy because the Ministry has 
not yet studied the issue; Poloff noted that if the Ministry 
required more time to formulate voting instructions, the 
Haitian delegation could support a delay in the vote to give 
Haiti and other Executive Board members time to study the 
issue further.
