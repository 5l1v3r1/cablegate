SUBJECT: GAZA HUMANITARIAN UPDATE - JANUARY 7 
 
REF: Jerusalem 46 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  An estimated 30-40 truckloads entered Gaza 
through Kerem Shalom crossing and an additional five to ten entered 
via Rafah crossing on January 7.  A total of 360,000 liters of fuel 
for the power plant entered via Nahal Oz on January 7, but had not 
been picked up on the Gaza side as of 1600 local due to the security 
situation.  A "humanitarian pause" on January 7 allowed distribution 
of some humanitarian aid, but contacts reported shelling and a 
Qassam launch near Gaza City during the pause.  Military operations 
inside Gaza continued to disrupt distribution of humanitarian 
supplies.  End Summary. 
 
Crossings Open for Limited Shipments 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) WFP contacts said that 30-40 truckloads of humanitarian 
supplies entered Gaza through Kerem Shalom crossing on January 7. 
5-10 truckloads of humanitarian aid from Arab countries entered 
through Rafah crossing.  The GOI reportedly accepted only 10 of 
WFP's requested 20 truckloads.  EU contacts said that 360,000 liters 
of industrial fuel were transferred at Nahal Oz fuel station on 
January 7, but the shipments were not delivered to the power plant 
because Palestinian truck drivers were unwilling to transit the 
area.  Karni's conveyer belt and Erez crossing were closed on 
January 7. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On January 6, a total of two trucks of medical supplies 
entered Rafah crossing, and 20 medical evacuees exited there. 
 
"Humanitarian Pause" Allows Increased Movement 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶4. (SBU) The IDF implemented a "humanitarian pause," between 1300 
and 1600 local on January 7.  According to UNRWA contacts, the pause 
allowed aid agencies to safely distribute some humanitarian 
supplies, but it did not increase the number of shipments into Gaza. 
 WHO Gaza director told Econoff that a WHO truck was denied entry 
into Gaza City during the pause, while another was allowed passage. 
WHO contacts said that several shellings were heard in and around 
Gaza City during 1300-1600 local on January 7. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Gaza contacts report using the pause to purchase needed 
supplies, fill water containers, and check on relatives.  Press 
reports indicate that the IDF did not grant access in all areas. 
According to one report, ambulance workers were required to use a 
local donkey cart to retrieve injured and transport them back to the 
waiting ambulance. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Contacts report varying accounts of whether the pause will 
be repeated on January 8. 
 
¶7. (SBU) UNRWA reported that one of its truck convoys traveling from 
Gaza City to Kerem Shalom on January 7 was fired upon.  UNRWA 
contacts say the attacks occurred after the GOI provided assurances 
the movement was coordinated. 
 
Fuel sector seeking transport security 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Gaza fuel sector executives told Econ specialist on 
January 7 that they are seeking "guarantees" of safe passage before 
picking up fuel at Nahal Oz, given ongoing military operations. 
UNRWA contacts said that they plan to distribute some UNRWA fuel 
stocks to four Gaza hospitals and the Coastal Municipal Water 
Utility for water and sewage pumps, the majority of which are not 
operating, per WHO contacts. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Although 215,000 liters of industrial diesel were 
distributed to the power plant on January 6, it was insufficient to 
restart the turbines, according to OCHA contacts in Gaza, and the 
plant remains down. 
 
16,600 Gazans in Shelters 
------------------------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) UNRWA reported that it has established 27 shelters for 
more than 16,600 displaced persons.  According to Save the Children, 
approximately half are children under 15 years old.  UNRWA plans to 
distribute food and water to all of its shelters, but has an 
insufficient number of blankets and mattresses. 
 
¶11. (SBU) UNRWA contacts reported that it restocked 6 food 
distribution sites on January 6 and distributed from those sites on 
January 7.  According to UNRWA, the WFP had to cancel its food 
distribution in Gaza City on January 6 because representatives could

not access its warehouse.  WFP was able to deliver 75MT of flour to 
about 750 families in Khan Younis.  The WFP plans to distribute a 
full food basket in Khan Younis on January 7. 
 
85 percent of mobile phones down 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶12. (SBU) PalTel telecom contacts said on January 6 that 85 percent 
of PalTel's phone customers in Gaza do not have service and 160 of 
its 200 towers were down.  (Note:  However, ConGenOffs had more 
success reaching Gazans on their mobile phones on January 7 than the 
day before.  End Note.) 
 
PMA requests cash transfers to Gaza 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶13. (SBU) The PMA on January 7 officially requested the Bank of 
Israel to authorize two separate cash transfers of 243 million NIS 
and 16 million USD from the West Bank to Gaza.  The funds are 
allocated to pay Palestinian Authority salaries, UNRWA cash 
assistance, and social welfare payments. (Septel) 
 
¶14. (SBU) PA President Mahmud Abbas issued a decree on January 7 
that the PA will deduct one day's salary from government employees 
in the West Bank for the benefit of Gaza, according to local 
contacts and press reports.
