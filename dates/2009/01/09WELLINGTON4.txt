SUBJECT: NEW ZEALAND RESPONSE TO ACTION REQUEST CONCERNING 
IRAN PRESIDENCY AT UNDP 
 
REF: SECSTATE 1500 
 
¶1. (SBU) In response to reftel, Poloff contacted Nik Kiddle, 
Deputy Director of the Human Rights Division of the New 
Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT).  Poloff 
discussed reftel background points with Kiddle and requested 
the GNZ to support the USG position on Iran's candidacy for 
president of the UNDP. 
¶2.  (SBU) Kiddle stated that MFAT was aware of Iran's 
candidacy for the position and, because of the significance 
of the matter, had already brought the issue to the attention 
of the NZ Minister of Foreign Affairs Murray McCully.  After 
consultation with Minister McCully, according to Kiddle, MFAT 
directed its mission at the UN to abstain from participating 
in the vote on the UNDP presidency.
