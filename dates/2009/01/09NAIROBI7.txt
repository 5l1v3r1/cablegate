REF: 08 NAIROBI 2899 
 
¶1.  Summary:  The semi-automous region of Puntland's 66 new 
legislators were sworn in on January 1 in Garowe.  They will 
spend the next week being courted by candidates for the 
presidency of Puntland.  The MPs are scheduled to elect a 
President on January 8.  Recently-resigned Transitional 
Federal Government (TFG) President Abdullahi Yusuf spoke at 
the January 1 swearing-in ceremony, underlining his 
neutrality in the race, and hoping for a peaceful and 
undisputed outcome.  Former Somali Prime Minister Hassan 
Abshir Farah, who was a strong candidate for the Puntland 
presidency, has withdrawn from the race.  End summary.

Puntland Parliament Seated 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2. Puntland's Ratification Commission on December 30 
announced the selection of the 66 new Members of Parliament. 
The Commission's chairman stated that each representative had 
the full support of his elders (reftel).  A loose collective 
of opposition candidates protested the slate of MPs, claiming 
that all were allies of incumbent Puntland President Mohamud 
"Adde" Muse Hersi.  The opposition reportedly threatened to 
hold demonstrations throughout Puntland, but those protests 
did not materialize.  The new MPs were sworn in on January 1 
at Garowe's Parliament House.  The new MPs will elect a 
Speaker in the next few days, and on January 8 will elect the 
new President of Puntland.  One contact stated that the new 
MPs will have a very busy week as each of the candidates for 
the Puntland presidency will work overtime to gain their 
favor (reftel).

Yusuf Declares Himself Neutral, 
Meets Opposition 
------------------------------- 
 
¶3. Recently-resigned Transitional Federal Government (TFG) 
President Abdullahi Yusuf, who himself had formerly been 
President of Puntland, spoke at the January 1 swearing-in 
ceremony, declaring himself neutral in the race. He hoped the 
MPs would select the best candidate, regardless of clan 
affiliation.  In an apparent reference to the disputed 
outcome of an earlier election in which he had clashed with 
opponent Ali Jama before ultimately taking office, Yusuf 
urged all Puntlanders to work to avoid a repeat "of what 
happened in 2001." 
 
¶4. Earlier in the week, Yusuf met with the opposition 
candidates, who reportedly attempted to elicit his election 
preferences. They also offered a long list of complaints 
about the new MPs.  According to the opposition candidates, 
their six-hour meeting yielded a promise from Yusuf that he 
would remain neutral.  The head of the opposition claimed 
Yusuf promised to "work as a man of peace."

Incumbent Urges Fair Election 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5. Current President Mohamud "Adde" Muse Hersi also spoke, 
congratulating the new MPs and thanking Yusuf for his 
participation in the ceremony.  Muse added that the new MPs 
should work to move Puntland toward "full democracy."

Abshir Drops Out 
---------------- 
 
¶6. Hassan Abshir Farah, formerly Prime Minister of Somalia 
and a strong candidate in the current contest for President 
of Puntland, dropped out of the race on December 31.  Farah 
cited the multitude of candidates, including several from his 
Nugal region, as his reason for withdrawing.  However, 
contacts speculate that Abshir is positioning himself for a 
run at the presidency of the TFG.
