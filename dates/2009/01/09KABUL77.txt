SUBJECT: AFGHAN SHIAS OBSERVE ASHURA UNDER NEW TOLERANCE 
 
¶1. (U)  SUMMARY.  Afghan Shia observed the Ashura holiday 
this month, staging public demonstrations of their faith that 
went largely unchallenged by the country's Sunni majority. 
Thousands of Shia took to the streets in processions in 
Kabul, Herat, and other cities -- an open display that stood 
in stark contrast to the strict limits on Ashura ceremonies 
during the Taliban era. 
 
Observations Peaceful in Kabul 
---------- 
 
¶2.    (SBU) More than a week before the official holiday 
January 7, western Kabul was bedecked in black, green and red 
banners as ethnic Hazara and other Afghan Shia prepared for 
the public mourning of the martyrdom of Hussein ibn Ali, 
grandson of the prophet Mohammad.  In an emerging trend, 
Afghans also hung pictures of MP Sayed Mustafa Kazimi -- 
killed along with several other MPs in a 2007 bombing -- on 
storefronts and fences.  Kazimi had been one of the 
highest-ranking Shia politicians. Some Afghans, however, say 
Kazimi was a major beneficiary of Iranian support and that 
the Iranian government is funding the campaign to popularize 
his martyrdom.  Kabul authorities closed major streets to 
make room for processions of mourners, who engaged in the 
chest-beating and self-flagellation typical among some Shia 
who observe the holiday. 
 
¶3.    (U) The Taliban had banned such commemorations and many 
Afghan Sunnis conitnue to dislike the graphic display of 
mourning by their Shia countrymen that marks Ashura. 
However, the large and uneventful public processions this 
year show an emerging religious tolerance for other 
interpretations of Islam.  Some Afghans assert Iranian 
government funding of Ashura celebrations, mosques, and 
cultural centers threatens Afghanistan's majority Sunni 
culture, but such concerns are often entangled with 
conspiracy theories and long-running political rivalries. 
Some Shia-led ceremonies included participation by Sunni 
clerics, tempering anti-Shia prejudices. 
 
Heratis Join Together, Despite Threat of Conflict 
---------- 
 
¶4.    (SBU) Commemorations in Herat, one of the country's 
largest Shia population centers, also passed without 
violence, despite fears that a Sunni group was plotting to 
disrupt events.  A night letter circulated by a group calling 
itself "Supporters of Prophetic Customs and Traditions" 
labeled Shia commemorators "puppets of Iran" and warned that 
public observations of Ashura would ignite sectarian 
violence.  The group demanded that the government contain 
ceremonies to Shia mosques. 
 
¶5.    (SBU) Local police responded with a heavy presence at 
intersections and public gatherings.  Government officials 
attended Ashura observations at three major Shia mosques 
(Shias had hoped provincial officials would approve more 
sites for the ceremonies.)  Locals credited the peaceful 
ceremonies to good cooperation among Sunni and Shia leaders, 
as well as the efforts of the new provincial police chief. 
 
Tolerance the Theme Nationwide 
---------- 
 
¶6.    (SBU) Balkh Governor Atta allowed local Shias to hold 
ceremonies at Mazar-e-Sharif's famed Blue Mosque, a Sunni 
temple.  Shia also won, for the first time, permission to 
display their colored banners throughout the city.  Local 
Shia businessmen apparently funded most of the day's events, 
although diplomats from the Iranian consulate made 
appearances at various mosques around town.  Elsewhere, 5,000 
Shias attended a ceremony in Kunduz and more than 10,000 
gathered in Helmand.  In provinces with smaller Shia 
populations, Shia families typically celebrated in their 
homes or in small groups at local mosques.
