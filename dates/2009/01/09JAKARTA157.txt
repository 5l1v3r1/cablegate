SUBJECT: NEW G-20 SHERPA URGES ACTION AND COMMITMENT TO FIGHT 
ECONOMIC CRISIS 
 
¶1. (SBU) The credibility of the G-20 is at risk unless its members 
implement their commitments, according to Indonesia's new sherpa. 
Deputy Minister at the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs 
Mahendra Siregar lamented that G-20 countries were unable to revive 
the WTO Doha round in December.  He acknowledged that many G-20 
countries, including Indonesia, had implemented seemingly 
protectionist policies contrary to their leaders' promises.  In 
Indonesia's case there is a constant battle between economic 
technocrats and individual ministries headed by politicians looking 
at the April parliamentary elections, with the politicians often 
winning (see Jakarta 69 on Cabinet divisions over economic policy). 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mahendra added that the April G-20 Summit should develop 
concrete steps to fight the global economic crisis.  He noted that 
the first Summit was essential to demonstrate the Leaders' 
seriousness and to identify initial areas of work.  But, in order to 
retain credibility, the G-20 must now show that it can act (he did 
not offer any specifics). 
 
¶3. (SBU) Mahendra replaces Presidential adviser Chatib Basri as G-20 
sherpa.  Basri will take on the role of finance deputy.  Ministry of 
Finance official Anggito Abimanyu, who served as finance deputy at 
the first Summit, will serve as Indonesia's point person on the 
France/Indonesia led G-20 working group on reforming the World Bank 
and regional development banks.
