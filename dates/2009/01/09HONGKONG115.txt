Â¶1. The Hang Seng Index closed Friday, January 16 at 13,255.51, down 
12.55 points today with a daily trade of HKD 49 billion.  The Index 
continued its slide, falling 1121.93, or 7.8 percent, this week. 
Both Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs issued reports this week 
predicting HSBC, Hong Kong's biggest bank and the largest 
constituent stock on the Hang Seng Index, would need to raise 
capital to bolster its capital adequacy ratio.  HSBC shares dropped 
below HKD 65 this week, the bank's lowest level in the past decade. 
HIBOR remained low.  Overnight and one-week rates, as reported by 
Hang Seng Bank today, stood at 0.1 percent. One-month and 
three-month rates were 0.2 percent and 0.85 percent respectively.
