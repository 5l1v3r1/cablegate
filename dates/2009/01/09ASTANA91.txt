Diplomatic Note 22-1/75 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Kazakhstan 
expresses its compliments to the Embassy of the United States of 
America and in response to the Embassy's diplomatic note of December 
11, 2008, has the honor to inform that Kazakhstan expresses its 
consent to the transit of commercial cargo of non-military purpose 
through the territory of Kazakhstan to Afghanistan, excluding the 
goods and materials noted in Enclosure 1 of the above-referenced 
diplomatic note.  (NOTE:  For the sake of clarity, this was the 
enclosure in our December 11, 2008 diplomatic note which listed the 
military goods, such as ammunition, that we promised we would not 
ship through Kazakhstan.  END NOTE.) 
 
The Ministry avails itself of this occasion to renew to the Embassy 
the assurances of its highest consideration.
