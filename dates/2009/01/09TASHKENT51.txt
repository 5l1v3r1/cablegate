¶1. (SBU)  Afghan Charge d'Affairs Mohammad Essa Mesbah met with us 
on January 12 and gave us an upbeat assessment of Uzbek-Afghan 
talks on electricity pricing held last week between Afghan Minister 
of Economics Shams and Uzbek Deputy Prime Minister Azimov.  (Shams 
met separately to discuss technical issues with Deputy Prime 
Minister Shaismatov and Uzbekenergo Chairman Teshabaev.)  The talks 
culminated in the January 6 signing of a new annual purchase 
agreement under which Afghanistan will buy 70 MW of electricity 
from Uzbekistan in 2009 for $0.06 USD per kWh.  This price is 
unchanged from 2008, when Afghanistan purchased 35MW of Uzbek 
electricity. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Charge Mesbah also told us that the first of two 220kV, 
150MW power transmission lines from the Surkhan substation to the 
Afghan border (ref A) is nearly 80 percent built with completion 
expected within the next two months.  Construction of the second 
transmission line has begun and is slated to be finished before the 
end of 2009.  This is also the scheduled completion date for a new 
240km, 500kV line between the Surkhan and Guzar substations in 
Uzbekistan that must be completed if Uzbekistan is to have 
sufficient capacity to supply 300MW of electrical power to 
Afghanistan (ref B). 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Charge Mesbah, Shams told the Uzbek side that 
Afghanistan wants to become a member of the Coordination Dispatch 
Center (CDC).  Mesbah said the Uzbek response had been positive, 
although Afghanistan will need to submit a formal application that 
will have to be reviewed by Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and 
Kazakhstan, the CDC's current four members.
