RATIFICATION 
 
REF: STATE 00322 
 
(U) On January 5, reftel demarche was transmitted to Francois 
Ravardeaux, MFA desk officer for non-proliferation and IAEA 
matters.  On January 2, the MFA had issued the following 
statement (informal Embassy translation):  "France welcomes 
the U.S. signature of the instrument of ratification of the 
IAEA Additional Protocol.  Within the UN General Assembly as 
well as the IAEA, and in the context of the Non-Proliferation 
Treaty, France continuously underscores the importance of 
this verification instrument for nuclear non-proliferation. 
We immediately call on all States that have not yet done so 
to sign and bring into effect a Safeguards Agreement and an 
Additional Protocol, which constitute from our standpoint the 
current norms of verification."
