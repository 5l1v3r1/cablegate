  Editorial Quotes

¶1. NEGROPONTE'S VISIT 
 
"Bush sends an envoy to China for a farewell tour: Negroponte says: 
U.S.-China relations is the legacy of the Bush administration" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/09): "Eight years ago, no one could 
imagine that the deputy secretary of the most hawkish government in 
years would say that the U.S. and China have no discord. 
Negroponte's visit to China is being seen as the Bush 
administration's farewell to China.  In this complicated 
relationship, the two countries [the Bush administration and China] 
have shown some unwillingness to part ways. Even though the Bush 
administration has received more criticism than compliments, the 
U.S.-China relationship is considered the legacy of the Bush 
administration.  Negroponte mentioned that the U.S.-China relations 
have become mature.  Chinese experts also indicate that China's 
gradually increasing strength is the foundation for the broader and 
closer U.S.-China relations.  What is more, the system for the U.S. 
and China to control crisis has gradually improved.  Both countries 
have realized peaceful development is a basic need for them." 
 
¶2. PAULSON'S COMMENTS 
 
"Spilling dirty water on China harms China as well as the U.S." 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/09): "In the U.S. where the financial 
crisis started, some did not reflect on their own mistakes but tried 
to conceal the mistakes and shifted their responsibilities. 
Secretary Paulson and Bernanke are at the forefront of this scandal. 
 Paulson said it is newly-emerging market countries' high deposit 
rate that has caused economic imbalance and Bernanke said the 
bubbles of the American real estate industry are the fault of 
Chinese people's high deposit rate.  These are completely 
irresponsible comments.  The global conclusion is that, first the 
large amount of sub-prime real estate loans, second the financial 
byproducts, third the ineffectiveness of the market regulation 
system, and fourth the failure of the financial supervision 
institutes are the real reasons for the financial crisis.  All of 
these contributors have been directly caused by the U.S.  Not to 
mention the anti-terror war initiated by the U.S. to realize its 
global hegemony strategy, speculation of its transnational companies 
to dominate other countries' economy and its luxurious consumption 
culture has all been responsible for the crisis." 
 
¶3. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"The U.S.-China 30th anniversary overthrows the Western theories of 
China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(01/09): "For the past 30 years, why hasn't 
the development of U.S.-China relations caused any war but on the 
contrary has manifested more harmony?  The existing western theories 
on international relations are unable to explain the phenomenon. 
Among the various theories that are available to explain the 
relationships that take place between large countries, economic 
reliance is the theory that is used the most when describing the 
past 30 years of the China-U.S. relationship.  However, all these 
Western theories are inherently flawed because they are based on 
Western historical and social incidents.  In fact, this new 
phenomenon [China's rise] and the development of China's 
relationships have moved out of the scope of the Western theories 
that Chinese theorists have relied upon.  As a scholar indicated, 
whomever can explain the rise of China, will be the world's 
master."
