SUBJECT: PRIVATE UNIVERSITY STUDENTS PETITION EMBASSY DAMASCUS ON 
GAZA 
 
¶1.  Two students from the private Arab International University 
brought a letter to the American Cultural Center on December 31, 
2008, for delivery to the Charge d'Affaires.  The letter, signed by 
more than a thousand students from the university, concerns events 
in Gaza.  The students also requested that the PAO participate in a 
documentary film they are making about their collective efforts to 
garner support for the citizens of Gaza and requested her help in 
finding ways to assist Gazans.  One of the students is an alumnus of 
the MEPI Summer Institute for Student Leaders.  The students staged 
a candlelight vigil on New Year's Eve together with students of 
other universities to welcome the New Year "in our own way," i.e. to 
speak out peacefully about Gaza. 
 
¶2.  Text of letter: 
 
"On behalf of the student body of the Arab International University, 
we beseech your immediate, swift intervention and resolution to the 
present terrorist atrocities in Gaza, Palestine.  Unified, the 
student body hereby strongly condemns the unethical, immoral, 
irrational, inhumane, pusillanimous actions that can only be 
unmistakably categorized as terrorist actions.  This despicable 
carnage's only objective is the extermination of the Palestinian 
people's existence.  It also eliminates their fundamental human 
right of life and liberty; for themselves and their children.  We 
plead the United Nation's haste in imposing its power and force in 
order to stop the massacres and salvage what little there may well 
be left. 
 
-- Arab International University Damascus, Syria"
