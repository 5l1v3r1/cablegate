REF: 08 STATE 127448 
 
¶1.  In post's assessment, France continued to meet 
its international commitments in 2008 to eliminate 
the worst forms of child labor in its overseas 
territories.  The following update is in response to 
reftel's request for information to determine if 
countries eligible for trade benefits under the 
Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) are meeting 
their obligations to combat such practices. 
 
¶2.  Article L4153-1 of the French labor code 
prohibits employment for individuals under 16, 
including in France's overseas territories.  In 
addition, article 52-1322 specifies that this 
prohibition extends to the territory of Wallis and 
Futuna.  According to our contacts in the Ministry 
of the Interior, the law on child labor is respected 
and enforced in all of France's overseas 
territories. 
 
¶3.  French authorities launched no new initiatives 
in 2008 to protect against the worst forms of child 
labor.  But an Interior Ministry official confirmed 
to poloff December 30 that the ministry had received 
no new complaints with respect to child labor 
practices in French overseas territories in 2008. 
In addition, we are unaware of any independent 
reports of cases of child labor-related abuses in 
France's overseas territories during the past year.
