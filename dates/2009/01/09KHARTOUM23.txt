SUBJECT: KHARTOUM: SECTION 565 WAIVER REQUEST 
 
REF STATE 132944 
 
¶1. (SBU) Khartoum requests waiver of the requirements of Section 565 
of Title V, Part C of the Foreign Relations Authorizations Act for 
the reasons contained in paragraph two. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Both the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), which ended 
the 21-year civil war in 2005, and the Interim National Constitution 
guarantee the rights of non-Muslims in Khartoum, and the secular 
Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM) is part of the new 
Government of National Unity (GNU). However, in practice, Sharia law 
continues to be enforced in Khartoum and Islamic fundamentalists 
maintain effective control of the government. While initially 
becoming more tolerant after the signing of the peace agreement, 
security forces backed by Islamic fundamentalists orchestrated 
several crackdowns on the press and civil society organizations in 
¶2008. To require firms to sign or accept such a certification would 
subject them to possible harassment by Government of Sudan 
organizations or by fundamentalist organizations. Local companies 
would not sign or accept such a certification and there are not 
available alternative sources for essential services and supplies. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Language from last year's justification for certification 
and waiver remains valid as it pertains to Sudan.
