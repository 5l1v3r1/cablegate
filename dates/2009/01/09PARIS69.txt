¶1.  Reftel reports on Agriculture Minister Barnier's statement 
attacking revised USG sanctions in beef hormone case. In a more 
constructive response, the president of the Roquefort 
cheese-producing Midi-Pyrenees region is sending President-elect 
Obama a gift of the blue delicacy to commemorate his inauguration. 
Martin Malvy released a statement January 16 in which he decried a 
decision that "makes no sense" and asks the new administration to 
re-examine the decision "with greater care."  In a letter attached 
to the statement, Malvy also highlights his belief that negotiations 
with the EU on the issue remain possible. 
 
¶2.  Following is an unofficial translation of the statement and 
letter: 
 
Martin Malvy sends a carton of Roquefort cheese to Barack Obama 
 
Martin Malvy, President of the Midi-Pyrenees Region, announced 
Friday January 16 that he has sent a carton of Roquefort cheese to 
the American President-elect Barack Obama as an inauguration gift. 
 
"The inauguration of Barack Obama brings great hopes," said Martin 
Malvy, "particularly for better relations between the United States 
and Europe.  In that context, the measure taken to triple customs 
duties on Roquefort cheese makes no sense.  I have therefore sent 
this prestigious product of Midi-Pyrenees agriculture to President 
Barack Obama requesting that, beginning Tuesday, the new American 
administration reexamine the case with greater care."

Monsieur Barack Obama 
President 
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW 
THE WHITE HOUSE 
WASHINGTON, DC 20520 
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA 
 
Mr. President, 
 
Several weeks ago I took the opportunity to send you my 
congratulations, noting how pleased we were with your election as 
President of the United States. 
 
I am writing you today to ask your kind assistance to the economy of 
the Region for which I speak. 
 
Your predecessor and his administration have just taken the decision 
to increase by 300% the import duties on Roquefort cheese in 
response to measures taken by the European Union to bar entry into 
Europe of meat from cattle raised with hormones. 
 
Roquefort is a cheese produced in France, more precisely in Aveyron, 
in the Midi-Pyrenees Region which I head. 
 
It is a product that can be made in no other part of the world, as 
it must be manufactured to strict, specific, natural and very local 
standards.  With the time and effort devoted by people whose 
livelihoods depend on it, it has become indispensible to the economy 
of this very rural part of France. 
 
The Midi-Pyrenees Region is a pioneer in this sector and has worked 
for many years to ensure quality in the production of its 
agricultural products. 
 
In addition, I consider that the decision taken by the United States 
is not fair.  Roquefort cheese has become the unwilling hostage of 
international agreements on the import and export of agricultural 
products. 
 
Mr. President, I wish to present you a Roquefort cheese on the 
occasion of your inauguration so that you might be able to 
appreciate it in all its quality, but above all to kindly request 
you to review that decision, and in the hope of being able to 
welcome you to our region during one of your visits to France and 
present you in detail the agro-food sector, of which Roquefort has 
been for generations one of the most emblematic products. 
 
I remain confident that a discussion with Europe on the subject of 
your exportation is possible. 
 
Please be assured, Mr. President, of my best wishes for you. 
 
PARIS 00000069  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
Martin Malvy
