SUBJECT: RRT ERBIL: EVENTS ON INTERNATIONAL DAY FOR THE ELIMINATION 
OF VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN 
 
REF: State 104380 
 
This is an Erbil Regional Reconstruction Team (RRT) cable. 
 
¶1.  This message responds to request for information on the RRT's 
actions to support the International Day for the Elimination of 
Violence against women (reftel). 
¶2.  The KRG's Ministry of Sports and Youth hosted a cultural 
celebration to highlight awareness of the U.N.'s International Day 
for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, November 25.  Prime 
Minister Barzani and Mrs. Talabani, wife of Iraqi President Jalal 
Talabani presented an annual award for the protection of women to 
journalist Mohammad Tahir, who has been doing research on the 
effects of honor killings on Kurdish society.  "Jin by Jin", a 
hard-hitting short on domestic violence created by a Salahaddin 
University cinema student was shown.  (Comment:  "Jin by Jin" refers 
to the tradition of exchanging wives when a family is too poor to 
pay for a dowry.  For example, a brother/father gives his 
daughter/sister in marriage and in return gets a wife for himself. 
 
End comment.)  U.S. remarks (delivered by RRT Officer Marsha Lance) 
stressed the need for greater community-wide involvement to combat 
violence.  The entire event was carried live on local TV and 
received extensive coverage in local print media. 
 
¶3. The Erbil RRT awarded a Quick Response Fund (QRF) micro purchase 
of $22,240 for the Asuda Organization to fund "16 Days of Activism 
Marking 25 November the International Day for Combating Violence 
against Women in Sulaimaniyah Province."  This project will 
specifically target eight disadvantaged areas in the cities of 
Hawraman, Halabja, Said Sadiq, Pishdar, Rania, Sharbazher, Kalar and 
Chamchamal.  Activities include printing and putting up banners 
carrying messages about the International Day for the Elimination of 
Violence against Women; producing and broadcasting radio programs 
about the event and inviting women's rights activists and advocates 
to talk about this day to the public; printing leaflets and 
pamphlets containing facts and information about 25 November as well 
as other issues related to rights of women; printing and 
distributing T-shirts, caps and other promotional materials; and 
conducting 16 seminars in secondary girls schools to explain to 
students the history of 25 November and the International Day for 
the Elimination of Violence against Women. 
 
¶4.  In addition to RRT activities during the 16 days of activism, 
the RRT plans to work with the Kurdistan Democratic Party to host a 
digital video conference on gender-based violence with 
Washington-based experts through the G/IWI office, sometime in the 
spring of 2009. 
 
¶5.  While it is important to highlight this issue during the 16 days 
of focus, the RRT believes that a continued emphasis on the topic is 
very much needed in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.  Septel will 
discuss the manifestations of violence against women in the 
Kurdistan Region, and highlight other RRT programs addressing this 
issue.
