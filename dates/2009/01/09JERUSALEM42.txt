Ground Operation Continues 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) According to Gaza-based contacts and local press, the IDF 
continued operations on January 6 throughout the Gaza Strip.  Ground 
troops have largely encircled Gaza City.  The IDF reportedly has not 
entered densely populated areas, but has bombarded the area and 
exchanged fire with militants on the city's outskirts, for example: 
 
 -- the IDF exchanged fire with militants north of Gaza City in 
al-Kashaf, near the former Civil Administration building and 
Jabaliya; 
 
 -- the IDF exchanged fire with militants south of Gaza City in 
Zaytun, near the former PA liaison offices; and 
 
 -- firefights were reported around Bayt Lahiya and Bayt Hanun. 
 
The IDF reportedly arrested and interrogated up to 80 Palestinians 
in northern Gaza.  The Israeli navy shelled the Gaza City shoreline 
from January 5 to 6, destroying several piers and beachfront 
buildings. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Gaza-based contacts and press reported that HAMAS 
militants employed sniperfire and ambushes, but did not field large 
forces against the IDF.  Al-Wafa hospital administrators reported 
that they were warned by the IDF to evacuate, but that there were 
too many wounded to transfer. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Press and Ramallah-based contacts confirmed that the IDF 
cut the road between Rafah and Khan Yunis, and unconfirmed media 
reports said Israeli tanks were moving up the road toward Khan 
Yunis.  There are no reports of IDF ground operations in urban 
centers in southern Gaza. 
 
Airstrikes Continue 
------------------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Gaza-based sources and local press reported that IAF 
airstrikes hit at least 30 targets during the night of January 5 and 
morning of January 6: 
 
 -- the IAF destroyed nine houses in northern Gaza overnight, 
several of which purportedly belonged to HAMAS leaders; 
 
 -- the IAF bombed the former Saraya security facility in Gaza City 
for the second time last night; 
 
-- the IAF struck targets in the central Gaza city of Dayr al-Balah 
and the Burayj refugee camp, killing at least five Palestinians, 
among them a baby girl; 
 
-- the IAF hit two UNRWA schools Tuesday morning, one in the Shati 
refugee camp and one in Gaza City, and an UNRWA shelter, killing at 
least nine Palestinians who had moved to those facilities seeking 
shelter; 
 
 -- in southern Gaza, the IAF continued to bomb tunnels running 
under the border, as well as targets east of Khan Yunis, and the 
al-Noor Charitable Society headquarters in Khan Yunis.

¶6.  (SBU) Israeli media reported at least 10 rockets were fired at 
Israel before 1300 on January 6.  One Grad-type rocket struck the 
town of Gedara (near Ashdod), lightly wounding a three-month old 
baby. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Palestinian medical contacts in Gaza and local press 
report between 71 and 100 Palestinians were killed in fighting 
January 5-6.  The same reports say that at least 120 Palestinians
