E.O. 12958: DECL: 01/26/2019
TAGS: PGOV PHUM KISL ASEC BA
SUBJECT: THREE SHIA LEADERS ARRESTED

REF: A. 08 MANAMA 845
¶B. 08 MANAMA 593

Classified By: CDA Christopher Henzel for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d).

¶1. (C) Summary: The government arrested three leaders of the
radical Shia Al Haq Movement when they failed to appear for
questioning in connection with an alleged bomb plot. End
Summary.

¶2. (C) Police arrested Haq Movement leaders Hassan Musheima,
Abduljalil Singace, and Mohammed Habib Maqdad in the early
hours of January 26 after the three ignored a summons to
appear for questioning related to the so-called national day
plot (ref A). Several of those accused in the plot stated in
controversial televised confessions that Musheima, Singace,
and Maqdad were the inspiration for their plan. Chief
Prosecutor Nawaf Al Mouada told Poloff that the GOB intends
to question the three about their alleged involvement in the
national day plot, evaluate their statements, and decide
whether to press charges. In a conversation with RSO, Chief
of Public Security Major General Abdul Latif Al Zayani
claimed that the GOB had been patient with Musheima and his
associates and argued that they had disrespected the legal
system by refusing to appear for questioning.

¶3. (SBU) As news of the arrests spread, there were
spontaneous demonstrations in a number of Shia areas,
including Jid Hafs, Sitra, and Sanabis. Shia youths burned
tires and trash dumpsters in Sitra, and several dozen clashed
with security forces near Musheima's home in Jid Hafs.

¶4. (C) Leaders of the mainstream Shia Wifaq party met during
the afternoon of January 26 but were unable to reach
consensus on how to react to the arrests. Our contacts
explain that on the one hand, Wifaq will not want to be
caught behind the curve if the Shia community rallies behind
Musheima, but neither will Wifaq want to inadvertently
bolster his standing in the Shia community by appearing too
supportive. (Ref B details the rivalry between Haq and
Wifaq.)

¶5. (C) Comment: Haq boycotts Bahrain's elections and condemns
its constitution as illegitimate. Haq activists claim the
three are being persecuted for these militant positions. The
GOB maintains that they were arrested for failing to
cooperate with an ongoing investigation into a plan to set
off IEDs in the capital.

¶6. (C) Comment continued: Most Bahraini Shia are highly
skeptical of the GOB's claim that the pipe-bomb plot reported
ref A was a large terrorist conspiracy. Interior Minister
Shaikh Rashid has assured us that Bahrain's legal system will
produce a convincing case that will eventually come out at
trial. What we have seen so far of the GOB's case has not
been conclusive.
