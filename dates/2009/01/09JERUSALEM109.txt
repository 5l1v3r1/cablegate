Main Stories: 
------------- 
All papers lead with coverage of "the war in Gaza."  Al Hayat Al 
Jadida's front page photo shows a presumed phosphorous bomb 
exploding above a populous Gaza neighborhood, while Al Ayyam shows a 
man with burns across his face and torso from an alleged phosphorous 
bomb.  Al Quds' front page highlights a photo of an infant with 
bloody face wounds.  Al Quds and Al Ayyam lead reporting with the 
death of 54 and injury of 440 Palestinians, of which 28 were 
children, on January 11, "the 16th day of the aggression on Gaza," 
bringing the Palestinian death toll, to more than 4,000 injured.  Al 
Hayat Al Jadida puts the January 11 Palestinian death toll at 38 and 
the total Palestinian death toll at 889, since Israeli military 
operations began in the Gaza Strip.  All front pages report on 
Israeli use of white phosphorus bombs and run inside fact sheets 
about the weapon and calls made by local human rights groups for an 
investigation into Israel's use of these weapons. 
In coverage of American actions, all the papers cite AFP in 
front-page reports about president-elect Obama promising in an ABC 
interview to act on Middle East issues immediately after assuming 
office.  The papers also report that Obama has formed a team ready 
to work immediately on Middle East and Iran issues.  Al Quds cites 
Israeli daily Haaretz in front page statements quoting "close" Obama 
aids revealing that his administration might establish direct, 
possibly secret, contacts with Hamas, although, according to Al 
Quds, an official Obama spokesman has denied these reports.  The 
paper also comments that there is growing belief in Washington that 
the isolation of Hamas has not been useful and that Obama's advisors 
will encourage him to establish low profile contacts with the group. 
 
 
In an inside report, Al Quds cites Israeli daily Yedeot Aharanot in 
reporting on a "heated, shouting" telephone call between Secretary 
Rice and Israeli Foreign Minister Livni who accused Rice of working 
against Israel and intending to vote for the recent UN Security 
Council resolution for a ceasefire in Gaza, until President Bush 
called Rice at the last moment and instructed her to abstain.  The 
paper quotes Binjamin Ben Eliezer, a close aide to Israel's Defense 
Minister Barak stating, "I congratulate Condolicy (the paper adding 
in brackets that the name was deliberately "distorted") on 
concluding her service with this miserable resolution."  The paper 
also notes that Rice has expressed concerns, in "closed" meetings, 
over the possible deterioration of the situation in the West Bank if 
"aggression" continues. 
 
In Israeli military news, Al Ayyam's front page cites news agencies 
in revealing an Israeli plan to occupy areas of the Gaza Strip, 
especially along the Egyptian border.  Al Quds' front page cites DPA 
in reporting that Israeli soldiers, disguised in Hamas militant 
"uniforms", used medical vehicles to travel inside Gaza, where, 
according to Israel, Hamas leaders are hiding in the offices of 
foreign diplomatic missions.  Al Ayyam's front page reports on 
Israeli military drills practicing to "invade" Gaza.  The paper adds 
that the Israeli army has called up more reservists for combat in 
Gaza.  Al Quds' front page, meanwhile, reports that Israeli 
artillery continued shelling Gaza neighborhoods on January 11, even 
during Israel's unilateral three-hour truce, adding inside, that the 
Israeli army killed Hamas leader Amir Mansy who commanded Hamas 
rocket attacks.  Finally, Al Ayyam's front page cites DPA in quoting 
UNRWA reports that more Palestinians are taking shelter at UNRWA 
schools in Gaza, as Israeli planes dropped leaflets on Rafah asking, 
"half of the city residents" to leave the city. 
In diplomacy, Al Quds' front page cites DPA in quoting Israeli 
 
JERUSALEM 00000109  002 OF 003 
 
 
officials, including Israeli Premier Olmert, stating that Israel's 
offensive in Gaza has achieved its goals and will soon be ended. 
All papers report on Gaza cease-fire talks between Palestinian 
Authority President Abbas and Jordan's King Abdullah in Amman on 
January 11.  The papers also front page reports on intensified 
Egyptian efforts to achieve a Gaza ceasefire, with the Israeli side 
focusing on the smuggling tunnels issue and continuing to question 
the effectiveness of deploying international forces to Gaza.  Al 
Hayat Al Jadida's front page cites news agencies in reporting that 
Egypt is satisfied with the progress of cease-fire talks with the 
Hamas delegation in Cairo. 
Al Quds' front page cites the New York Times in reporting that 
President Bush ignored an Israeli request to obtain 
bunker-penetrating bombs for use against Iran's major nuclear site 
in Natanz.  The paper adds that President Bush informed the Israelis 
that he would allow for "sabotage" of Iran's nuclear arms 
capabilities.

WEEKEND NEWS: 
-------------- 
 
Sunday, January 11 
 
Palestinian Authority (PA) statements were highlighted on all front 
pages.  All dailies quote PA president Abbas stating on January 10 
that, "we are in a race against time to end the [Israeli] aggression 
and everyday there are more martyrs and more destruction."  Abbas 
further called upon Hama to respond positively to the Egyptian 
cease-fire initiative and stop "wasting time" by offering "a large 
number of comments regarding the initiative."  Abbas also assigned 
blame to Israel for the "bloodshed" in Gaza.   Meanwhile, Abbas' 
Chief of Staff Al Hussayni warned of a "catastrophe" if Israel 
decides to target Gaza sewage facilities in its military operations. 
 For its part, Hamas spokesman Misha'al was quoted on all front 
pages rejecting both a new truce in Gaza and the deployment of 
international forces there. 
 
Saturday, January 10 
 
Lead headlines in all papers highlighted that, "Israel ignores UN 
Security Council Resolution and continues its aggression against 
Gaza."  Front pages also noted that the resolution was welcomed by 
the Palestinian Authority leadership. 
 
"Rice:  It is difficult for Israel to protect civilians in Gaza," 
according to an Al Ayyam front page headline that introduced 
reporting on the Secretary's January 9 statement.  The same front 
page also highlighted that,"High UN Human Rights Commissioner calls 
for an investigation into war crimes in Gaza."  Meanwhile, Al Quds' 
front page noted that Jordan recalled its ambassador from Israel, 
"in protest of Israeli aggression against the Gaza Strip."

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
 
1)  Al Quds editorial is titled, "Red flag" (01/12):  "Threats made 
by Israeli leaders... following the Israeli cabinet meeting, should 
be a red flag for the international community since these statements 
stressed an expansion of the continuing aggression... these [Israeli 
statements] clearly show that Israel is ignoring the international 
community and its resolutions, and that it is adamant about 
continuing what millions of people around the world consider to be 
 
JERUSALEM 00000109  003 OF 003 
 
 
massacres and war crimes... [Israel] attacked the American Secretary 
of State Condoleezza Rice and the British Foreign Minister for their 
support of the [UN cease-fire] resolution, even though Rice 
abstained from voting... the millions who have taken to the streets 
condemning what is happening [in Gaza]...cannot all be mistaken... 
the international community, particularly America, has proven once 
again that their policy does not support justice... democracy or 
human rights but rather supports occupation, killing and destruction 
and flagrant human rights violations... it is time for the Arab and 
Islamic peoples and the free peoples of the world, to tell Europe 
and America that they have had enough of hypocrisy and duplicity."
