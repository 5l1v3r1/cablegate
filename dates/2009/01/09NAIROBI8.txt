SUBJECT: SOMALIA - PUNTLAND PARLIAMENT ELECTS NEW SPEAKER 
 
REF: NAIROBI 7 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  Puntland's newly-seated Parliament elected a 
new Speaker on January 3.  Member of Parliament Abdirashid 
Muhammad Hersi, from Mudug Region, was the only candidate and 
was elected unanimously.  In accordance with the tradition of 
sharing power in Puntland, since the Speaker is from Mudug 
Region, the President and the Vice President should come from 
the Sool and Sanaag regions.  Meanwhile, incumbent President 
Mohamud "Adde" Muse Hersi no longer appears to be guaranteed 
a victory.  End summary.

One-Horse Race For Speaker, 
New Power Distribution

¶2. (U) Puntland's Parliament, which was sworn in on January 1 
(reftel), selected MP Abdirashid Muhammad Hersi as Speaker on 
January 3.  Hersi was the only candidate for the post, and 
was elected unanimously.  Salaad Hareed Ali and Hussein Haji 
Yusuf were elected as First and Second Vice Speakers, 
respectively.  Hersi will guide Parliament through the 
process of selecting a President, currently scheduled for 
January 8. 
 
¶3. (U) Hersi's election marks a departure from historical 
norms in Puntland politics. Previously, the presidency was 
held by someone from Puntland's predominantly Majertein clan 
Mudug or Bari regions, the vice-presidency was held by 
someone from Sool region (Dolbahante clan), and the Speaker's 
position was held by someone from Sanag region (Warsengeli 
clan).  Local sources tell us that General Abdullahi Ilkajir, 
who hails from Sanag region, urged MPs from Sanag not to run 
for Speaker, in order to allow Ilkajir to remain in the 
running for the presidency.  Hersi's election as Speaker 
should rule out any Mudug region natives becoming President 
or Vice President.

Incumbent Not Assured Victory 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) The current President of Puntland, Mohamud "Adde" Muse 
Hersi reportedly has far less support from among the 66 new 
MP's than he had from their predecessors, largely due to 
Hersi's apparently mediocre performance over the past four 
years.  Puntlanders are reportedly disappointed with the fact 
that, on Hersi's watch Puntland has become the base of a 
burgeoning piracy industry, which has resulted in a negative 
image of Puntland.  In addition, Hersi's administration is 
accused of corruption and incompetent economic policies, such 
as the printing of counterfeit Somali shillings and the 
resultant inflation.  Also causing unhappiness is the 
disputed Sool region's partial capture in skirmishes with 
Somaliland and the October 29 terrorist attacks.  Still, 
observers believe that his financial resources mean that 
Hersi cannot yet be written off.
