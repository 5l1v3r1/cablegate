SUBJECT: FRANCE:  JANUARY 13-14 CONTACT GROUP MEETING ON 
SOMALI PIRACY 
 
REF: A. STATE 1223

(SBU)  We conveyed on January 7 the materials in reftels 
concerning the January 13-14 meeting in New York on Somalia 
piracy issues, to Chantal Poiret, MFA official responsible 
for those issues, and to other MFA IO and AF officers.  On 
January 8, Jean-Hugues Simon-Michel, MFA PDAS for Strategic 
Affairs, Security, and Disarmament, responded, saying that 
the GOF had no major differences with the USG approach.  He 
noted that Poiret had been in contact with PM A/S Kimmitt 
directly and had provided feedback on our ideas for the 
meeting.  Simon-Michel said that France's main concern was 
that working with new and disparate partners such as China, 
India, (to a lesser extent) Russia, and others, with which 
Western countries had relatively little experience working in 
naval coalitions of the type contemplated, could present 
challenges that might be difficult to resolve quickly.  That 
said, Simon-Michel expressed appreciation for the work the 
USG had done in laying a firm foundation for the meeting. 
Simon-Michel said that he would accompany Poiret to the 
meeting and he expected that two officials (one a military 
officer) from France's UN delegation would also attend the 
meeting.  He hoped that the meeting could accommodate a 
French delegation of four participants.
