¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. At the direction of the Office of Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of 
the USDOC Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), Export Control 
Officer Philip Ankel (ECO) conducted a pre-license check (PLC) at 
the Product Testing and Dutiable Commodities Section, Government of 
Hong Kong Laboratory, 2B Cheung Yip Street, Hong Kong. The item in 
question is an Agilent 7500cx ICP-MS. This item is classified under 
export control classification number (ECCN) 3A233 and is controlled 
for nuclear nonproliferation (NP) reasons.  The license applicant is 
Agilent. 
 
¶3.  The Hong Kong Laboratory, Product Testing and Dutiable 
Commodities Section provides analytical and advisory support to the 
Customs and Excise Department in the enforcement of legislation 
concerning consumer protection.  More information can be found at 
www.govtlab.gov.hk. 
 
¶4.  On January 23, 2009, ECO visited the Product Testing and 
Dutiable Commodities Section and met with Dr. Mr. C K Tsang, 
Chemist, Analytical and Advisory Services Division.  He confirmed 
that the Product Testing and Dutiable Commodities Section ordered 
the item in question from Agilent's Hong Kong distributor, Tegent 
Technology as part of a tender process.  The new item is being 
purchased to replace an existing testing unit that is quite old and 
not capable of testing to the degree of specificity required in 
light of new regulatory requirements.  This section of the 
Government Laboratory tests samples provided by Hong Kong Customs 
(such as cosmetics or toys) for trace metal content.  Mr. Tsang was 
open and cooperative and provided purchase order and other 
documentation confirming the purchase. 
 
¶5.  ECO notes that Hong Kong government entities typically purchase 
equipment through a centralized tender process from Hong Kong 
resellers.  This process is an open and transparent process and ECO 
views it as highly unlikely that items procured by the Hong Kong 
Government or affiliated entities will be diverted to unauthorized 
end-uses or end-users. 
 
¶6.  Based on the information noted above, ECO believes that the 
Product Testing and Dutiable Commodities Section is a suitable 
recipient of U.S. origin controlled technology.
