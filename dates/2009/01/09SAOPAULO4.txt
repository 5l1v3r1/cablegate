For a Radical Pacifism 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (1/6) states: "In a framework like 
this, the only way to resist war is to support a radical pacifism 
without taking any prior sides.... That does not mean there is a 
balance of forces. It is clear Israel has superior state apparatus 
and military force. A military action by Israel is certainly more 
destructive than one perpetrated by Hamas. But in a state of war the 
worst illusion is to believe peace can only be pursued after a 
balance of forces has been achieved. And this is the most powerful 
ingredient for the continuation of the war itself."
