H.E. Hillary Clinton 
U.S. Secretary of State 
 
Excellency, 
 
      Sincere Congratulations from the Secretary-General of 
ASEAN 
 
I have the honour to extend to you my sincerest 
congratulations for your recent confirmation by the U.S. 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.  I am confident that with 
your rich experience and insightful determination, you would 
bring refreshing change to U.S. foreign policy. 
 
I am pleased to inform you that ASEAN-USA Dialogue 
Partnership has been strengthening in recent years.  The USA 
became the first among our friends and partners to appoint 
its Ambassador to ASEAN.  Our trade and other economic 
relations with the USA remain strong in spite of the 
worldwide economic slowdown. 
 
We in ASEAN are hopeful that the USA under President Barack 
Obama and with you as the Secretary of State will further 
strengthen the good and productive ASEAN-USA relationship. 
We also look forward to welcoming you to the annual ASEAN-US 
meeting of Foreign Ministers and the ASEAN Regional Forum 
(ARF) in Thailand in the third week of July 2009. 
 
Please accept, Excellency, the assurances of my highest 
consideration. 
 
/S/ 
Surin Pitsuwan 
 
End text.
