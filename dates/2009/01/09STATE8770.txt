¶1. (U) The Department has reviewed its files and finds that 
it possesses no credible information of gross violations of 
human rights at this time by the member of the Iraqi Security 
Forces listed below.  Department strongly suggests that visa 
applications for the individual be filed with as much time as 
possible to allow for additional processing procedures that 
may be required.  Note that if, at any time, the Embassy 
becomes aware of any information regarding incidents which 
could be deemed to be credible information of a gross 
violation of human rights by this individual, the Embassy 
should so inform the Department.
