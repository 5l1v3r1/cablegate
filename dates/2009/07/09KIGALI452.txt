SUBJECT: FIRES CONTAINED IN VOLCANOES PARK, GORILLAS NOT 
AFFECTED 
 
¶1. (U)  Summary:  Wildfires on the edge of the Volcanoes 
National Park, home to the silverback mountain gorillas, have 
been contained.  The extent of damage to the park is being 
assessed, but according to Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund 
International (DFGFI), the fires did not significantly impact 
the Gorillas habitat, nor has there been other loss of life. 
Offered Africom assistance was not needed. End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Wildfires broke out in the Volcanoes National Park in 
northern Rwanda on July 18.  Local government officials 
reported the fires to be under control as of July 21.  The 
fires began on the eastern edges of the park, allegedly 
started by bee farmers using traditional methods to smoke out 
beehives to harvest honey.  District Mayor Samuel Sembagari 
told reporters that this was the largest wildfire in the park 
since 1978. 
 
¶3. (U) Katie Fawcett, Director of DFGFI Karisoke Research 
Center, confirmed to econoff July 23 that the fires did not 
affect the silverback gorillas, which are mainly located in 
the central and western areas of the park.  According to 
Fawcett, the eastern edge of the park is primarily a 
"grassland ecosystem not really used by the gorillas either 
in Rwanda or Uganda."  Fawcett added that park has been 
unusually dry this year and that the extent of damage to 
plant species in the affected area was unclear. 
 
¶4. (U) The Rwandan Defense Forces (RDF) declined the offer of 
air assets by Africom to help control the fires.  RDF General 
Gatsinzi, tasked with fighting the fires, initially requested 
assistance from Africom, but canceled the request on Tuesday 
afternoon, July 21, saying the "fires were contained."
