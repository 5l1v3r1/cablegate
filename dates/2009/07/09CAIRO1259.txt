     C.CAIRO 458 Classified By: Ambassador Margaret Scobey per 1.4 (b) and (d). (C) Egyptian Assistant Minister of Defense Major General Mohamed Al-Assar told OMC Chief Major General Williams on July 2 that Egypt welcomes a visit by a team from PM to discuss end-use and other issues. We understand that this acceptance will allow PM to lift current holds on M1A1 production and Congressional notification re F-16s. Al Assar noted that due to the long-scheduled visit to Washington of the MOD "White Paper" team, the proposed late July timing for the PM team's visit will not work, and suggested a timeframe in early August instead.
