¶1. (SBU) Poloff delivered demarche (ref A) on June 29 to First 
Secretary Ricardo Portugal in Asia and Oceania Division II of the 
Ministry of Foreign Relations, who stated that Brazil was already 
working on complying with inspection-related provisions of UNSCR 
¶1874. Portugal confirmed that Brazil is attentive to the prospect of 
North Korean transfers of proscribed materials and will deny 
provision of North Korean-flagged vessels attempting to obtain 
bunkering services outside of port facilities when such materials 
are suspected. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Ricardo Portugal also commented on the current state of 
affairs between Brazil and North Korea.  Brazil's plans to open an 
embassy in Pyongyang (refs B and C) were apparently only somewhat 
delayed by North Korea's nuclear tests on May 25. Diplomatic 
communications are open, but Brazil's designated Ambassador to North 
Korea, Arnaldo Carrilho, is still in Beijing awaiting instructions. 
Portugal said he expected Carrilho would travel soon to Pyongyang 
and Mrs. Carrilho had already gone ahead to Pyongyang to set up 
house.
