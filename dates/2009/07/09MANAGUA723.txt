SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) On July 17, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) reported that 
U.S. citizen claimant Liana Woywod recovered her property 
confiscated by the GON in 1979.  The recovery of confiscated 
property by the original owner is a rare accomplishment in 
Nicaragua.  Including Mrs. Woywod's claim, the GON has resolved 48 
claims during the 2008-2009 waiver year.  End Summary. 
 
GON RESOLVES WOYWOD CASE 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. (U) On July 17, the GON reported that Attorney General Estrada 
issued a dictum on July 10 that stated that U.S. citizen Liana 
Woywod recovered her house located in the city of Masaya.  Mrs. 
Woywod's property had been confiscated by the GON in 1979 and 
transferred to a third party through the Laws 85 (1990) and 88 
(1990), known as the "Pinata Laws" (Ref A).  The GON provided the 
Property Office a copy of the dictum on July 17.  Mrs. Woywod's case 
represents one property claim registered with the Embassy Property 
Office.

PERSISTENCE PAYS OFF 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) In 2001, Mrs. Woywod filed a suit in court against the 
occupant to recover her property.  The court ruled in favor of the 
occupant and she appealed the decision.  In 2004, Mrs. Woywod began 
to negotiate the return of her property with the occupant.  In 2005, 
the occupant vacated the house and the GON re-registered the 
property under her name.  The recovery of confiscated property by 
the original owner is a rare accomplishment in Nicaragua. 
 
 
GON RESOLVES 48 CLAIMS SO FAR 
----------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Including Mrs. Woywod's claim, the GON has resolved 48 
claims during the 2008-2009 waiver year.  Between July 29, 2008, and 
July 17, the GON compensated 44 U.S. citizen claims belonging to 28 
U.S. citizens via indemnification bonds issued with a face value of 
161,679,400 cordobas, approximately $7,935, 886.  A thin secondary 
market exists for the sale of the bonds, the current price for which 
ranges between 37 and 50 cents on the dollar.  In addition, the 
courts ruled during the course of this waiver year that property be 
returned to one U.S. claimant.  One claimant signed a lease 
agreement with the Nicaraguan National Police (NNP) while the NNP 
builds a new office in order to return the property.  The GON also 
conducted a land swap with one U.S. citizen claimant for another 
property of comparable value (Ref B).
