DELEGATION WITH MFA UNDERSECRETARY 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary.  CDA Whitehead met with MFA Under Secretary 
Mutriff Sadiq on July 5 to discuss, inter alia, the upcoming visit 
of Special Envoy Gration.  Mutriff spoke at some length on efforts 
to assure a peaceful reaction to the anticipated July 22 arbitration 
decision on Abyei by The International Court of Arbitration in The 
Hague.   He also welcomed updated information on an upcoming U.S. 
trade delegation bound for the South of Sudan.  End summary. 
 
Trilateral Talks 
---------------- 
¶2. (SBU) Under Secretary Mutriff told Charge that he had just 
returned from the AU Summit in Sirte and was not aware of the change 
of dates of the next round of trilateral talks from July 13-16 until 
July 15-21, with the Special Envoy program for other events on the 
17th and 18th.  He added that he would raise this with Ghazi 
Salahaddin, the GOS Point-man on Darfur (Note: We have since 
confirmed directly with Ghazi that these dates are acceptable.  End 
Note.)  Mutriff confirmed that the GOS will host and provide a venue 
for the talks.  The CDA said that he would coordinate with GOSS 
officials on the details and timing of the meetings during his July 
6 and 7 visit to Juba, which we have done. 
 
 
Preparations for Abyei Arbitration Decision 
------------------------------------------- 
¶3. (SBU) Mutriff said that the Government of National Unity (GNU) 
had already held one round of discussions on how best to handle the 
anticipated July 22 decision by The International Court of 
Abritration in The Hague on Abyei.   He noted that the GNU would 
convene a second meeting on either July 6 or 7.  Mutriff added that 
the GNU  had already started a campaign to ensure a peaceful 
reaction to the arbitration decision.  .  Northern officials had 
scheduled a large meeting with Misseriya tribal and local leaders to 
reassure them that their rights would be respected no matter how the 
Court rules.  He said that they would also move National Police into 
position in conjunction with the announcement, but he said they 
would avoid a large, early build-up of forces, for fear that this 
would be provocative.  A high-level meeting of the Combined Joint 
Military Commission (CJMC)would take place in the period of July 6-8 
to discuss with the GOSS and the UN the best way forward.   Mutriff 
said that there also were ongoing discussions with UNMIS about the 
role it will play in avoiding a violent reaction to the arbitration 
decision on Abyei.  He cautioned, however, that the situation was 
tricky.  There was great emotion on both sides, and a single 
gunshot, either in celebration or in protest, could be 
misinterpreted and spark trouble.  He emphasized that great care 
should be taken on the ground. 
 
U.S. Trade Delegation to Southern Sudan 
--------------------------------------- 
¶4. (SBU) The CDA spoke about the U.S. trade delegation scheduled to 
visit Southern Sudan from July 12-18.  He noted that he had been 
told the GNU wanted the delegation to travel to Juba via Khartoum. 
However, the CDA explained that this would complicate scheduling and 
logistics.  He requested that the Undersecretary facilitate 
expeditious issuance of visas so that the delegation could travel to 
to Juba via Nairob.    The CDA added that if desired, arrangements 
could be made by the U.S. Embassy for travel to Juba by Khartoum 
businessmen who have commercial interests in the Southern areas so 
that they could meet the delegation during this visit.   The CDA 
reminded Mutriff that the GNU continues to put emphasis on making 
unity attractive to the South.    For this reason, he hoped the GNU 
would welcome the possibility of U.S. investment anywhere in Sudan. 
 Mutriff agreed, and said that he would look into the matter and 
seek to facilitate the issuance of visas for the visit.
