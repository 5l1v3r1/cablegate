REF: KIGALI 454 
 
 ¶1. (SBU)  On July 26, Rwanda government radio and television 
announced President Kabila's modest reshuffling of cabinet 
positions.  Most ministries went unchanged, with the key 
positions of Prime Minister and Ministers of Defense, 
Finance, Foreign Affairs, Internal Security, and Justice 
remaining in their positions.  The Minister of Cabinet 
Affairs Charles Murigande transferred to Education, the 
Minister of Local Government Protais Musoni switched to 
Cabinet Affairs, and the Minister of Agriculture Christophe 
Bazivamo took Musoni's place at Local Government.  The 
President elevated the Minister of State for Agriculture 
Agnes Kalibata to full Minister of Agriculture, and added a 
new Minister of State for Primary and Secondary Education, 
Mathias Habamungu (the previous one recently lost his 
position after a long-running corruption investigation) 
(reftel). The overall number of ministers and ministers of 
state dropped from 27 to 25.  Representation among the two 
major ethnic groups remained balanced at 13 Hutus and 12 
Tutsis.  As required by the Rwandan constitution, the Rwandan 
Patriotic Party (RPF) continues to retain no more than fifty 
percent of the cabinet positions (the Social Democratic Party 
(PSD) holds 2 seats, the Ideal Democratic Party 1 seat, the 
Liberal Party 1 seat, with 9 non-political technocrats in the 
cabinet). 
 
¶2. (SBU) The dropped Minister of Education, Dr. Gahakwa, 
served in her position for only 16 months; continuing 
difficulties in improving the quality of education appears to 
explain her firing.  Her replacement, Dr. Murigande, a high 
ranking RPF member and former Minister of Foreign Affairs, 
has previously served as the Rector of the National 
University (as well as teaching for many years at Howard 
University in the U.S.).  The new Minister of Local 
Government, Christophe Bazivamo, holds this position for the 
second time.  For the last two elections, he served as the 
election coordinator for the RPF campaign team. He is also 
the Vice President of the RPF.  His transfer appears to be a 
simple lateral change of duties.  Protais Musoni spent eight 
years as Minister of Local Government, where he led a massive 
decentralization effort.  Cabinet Affairs may be a bit of a 
demotion for him, or simply a less demanding spot in the 
cabinet after many years at a very busy ministry.  Elevation 
of Agnes Kalibata to full Minister of Agriculture represents 
a vote of confidence in her by the President. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Comment.  President Kagame once again tweaked his 
cabinet, firing one cabinet member, while having three trade 
places.  This minor repositioning of trusted civil servants, 
who have over the years held a number of senior positions in 
the government, represents no great changes in policy or 
personnel.  End comment.
