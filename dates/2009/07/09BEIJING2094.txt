¶1. U.S.-CHINA 
 
"Former U.S. Speaker of the House wants to use nuclear-armed Japan 
to suppress China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (07/22): "The former U.S. Speaker of the 
House Newt Gingrich recently openly used a nuclear-armed Japan as a 
bargaining chip to blackmail China, asking China to press North 
Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons.  Commenting on this, some 
analysts said that the United States used the atomic bomb to bomb 
Japan in World War II.  It does not have the courage to give the 
Japanese "retaliation" capabilities.  After North Korea's nuclear 
test, the voices for developing nuclear weapons in Japan have 
increased domestically.  This will certainly exacerbate the arms 
race in East Asia and make the North Korean nuclear issue more 
complicated. On the nuclear issue, the United States and Japan have 
historical grievances; Japan's possession of nuclear weapons is not 
in the interests of the United States.  Now some people in the 
United States want to put pressure on China by saying that Japan 
should also possess nuclear weapons.  This may encourage the people 
in Japan who advocate for possession of nuclear weapons.  China is 
opposed to the North Korean nuclear test and supports the framework 
of the United Nations sanctions against North Korea.  But China does 
not have the intention to dominate North Korea, nor does it have 
such a capability." 
 
 
¶2. CHINA-RUSSIA MILITARY EXCERCISE 
 
"Sino-Russian joint military exercise is to counter terrorism; it is 
not directed against a third party" 
 
The official Communist Youth League newspaper China Youth Daily 
(Zhongguo Qingnianbao) (07/22): "Some Western media are very 
sensitive about the Sino-Russian joint military exercise.  Some 
Western media published articles, arguing that China and Russia will 
form the core of a possible new military bloc and claiming that the 
joint military exercise is a counter-offensive attack against the 
United States.  Sun Bo, the research fellow of China Institute of 
Contemporary International Relations said that China's newly 
established security concept is to focus on cooperation, not 
confrontation, not targeting any third parties.  Cooperation between 
China and Russia is within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation 
Organization, protected by the law, and is not directed at any third 
parties.  (Western) speculations are unnecessary. " 
 
 
¶3. ENVIRONMENT 
 
"Which door does the 'carbon tariff' close?" 
 
The official Communist Party international paper, People's Daily 
Overseas Edition (Renmin Ribao Haiwaiban) (07/22): "A 'carbon 
tariff' is not only a violation of the basic rules of the WTO, but 
also contrary to the principle identified in the Kyoto Protocol that 
the developed and developing countries "have common but 
differentiated responsibilities" in the field of climate change. 
The carbon tariff is being used to implement real trade protection 
in the name of environmental protection.  The Obama Administration 
is attempting to increase its bargaining chip in international 
climate negotiations and force China, India, Brazil and other big 
developing countries to make concessions.  Some scholars have 
pointed out that the Obama Administration is trying to promote 
economic recovery via green industries, and seize the future 
industrial commanding heights after the financial crisis.  In fact, 
America's 'carbon tariff' is targeted at developing countries, 
including China.  Developing countries, as a result of a late start, 
are in a disadvantageous position compared to the developed 
countries in terms of industrial structure.  It is extremely unfair 
for developing countries to not only assume the responsibility for 
reducing emissions, but also bear the risk of economic contraction. 
The result of the implementation of a 'carbon tariff' by the U.S. 
Government may not be the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, but 
the retaliatory trade barriers imposed by developing countries.  The 
fundamental way for China to deal with the 'carbon tariff' is to 
continuously expand its domestic demand and reduce its dependence on 
exports, especially on exports of high energy-consumption 
products."
