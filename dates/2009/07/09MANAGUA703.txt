THREAT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 72975 
 
¶1. (U) On July 14, Embassy officials delivered reftel 
demarche to Nicaraguan Transport Minister Pablo Fernando 
Martinez and to the Institute of Civil Aviation's (INAC) 
legal advisor, Leonel Duarte.  We urged Minister Martinez and 
Mr. Duarte to advise the Central American Corporation for Air 
Navigation Services (COCESNA) not to suspend its air traffic 
control services to American Airlines (AA) and to allow the 
Honduran court system to resolve the dispute between the two 
parties.  (Note:  The Department's Office of Aviation 
Negotiations informed us on July 15 that COCESNA has agreed 
to allow AA to continue flying while the U.S. tries to 
resolve the question of rights under our Open Skies aviation 
agreements. End note.) 

¶2. (SBU) In his conversation with Minister of Transport 
Martinez, the DCM delivered reftel points and stressed that a 
decision by COCESNA to stop air traffic control services to 
American Airlines would be highly disruptive and damaging to 
Nicaragua's economy.  It would also, he explained, likely 
result in retaliation against Central American air carriers, 
something that was not needed at a delicate moment in 
U.S.-Nicaraguan relations.  Minister Martinez seemed to 
understand what was at stake and said that he would "speak to 
the President" about the situation. 

¶3. (SBU) Econ Counselor delivered demarche points to Leonel 
Duarte, the legal advisor for INAC, Nicaragua's civil 
aviation authority.  Duarte was less receptive than Minister 
Martinez and stated that the Government of Nicaragua (GON) 
had no role whatsoever in the dispute.  We explained that the 
scenario of a cutoff of air traffic control services to 
American Airlines raised serious concerns in terms of 
Nicaragua's commitments under its Open Skies aviation 
agreement with the United States.  We further suggested that 
Nicaragua could play a constructive role in encouraging 
COCESNA to continue to provide services to AA and to allow 
the Honduran court system to resolve the dispute.  Duarte did 
not recognize a role for Nicaragua, insisting that the 
dispute was solely between COCESNA and AA and that the GON 
would support whatever agreement the parties negotiated in 
Honduras.
