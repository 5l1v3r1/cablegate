In Today's Papers 
 
Congressman Moran: "Turkey Was Right Regarding The Iraq War" 
Turkey's semi-official Anatolian News Agency (AA) reports U.S. 
Congressman Jim Moran extended support to Turkey's EU membership, 
and said "Turkey should become a full member of the EU."  Moran said 
at a meeting at a [Fettullah Gulen-community backed] Rumi Forum 
gathering in Washington D.C. that Turkey should be able to pursue 
full EU membership (and not a privileged partnership which has been 
proposed by some circles).  He said it was not a coincidence that 
Turkey was one of the first countries visited by Barack Obama after 
he was sworn in as the president, and added Turkey had always played 
a central role geo-politically throughout the civilizations.  Moran 
said the U.S. made "terrible mistakes" during the war of Iraq.  He 
noted that 80 percent of Turkish people objected to the use of 
Turkish territories by the U.S. in that war, and stressed "Turkish 
people were right" while "the U.S. administration in that period was 
wrong."  Mainstream Milliyet quotes Moran in the headline, "Turkey 
Was Right (Regarding) The Iraq War." 
 
Turkey Will Re-Export Iranian Gas to Europe Under Nabucco (Aksam) 
Mainstream Aksam, citing unnamed Turkish Foreign Ministry (MFA) 
sources, reports that the EU and Turkey want to include Iranian gas 
into the Nabucco Pipeline Project in a way that will not offend the 
U.S.  According to the plan, part of the natural gas Turkey 
purchases from Iran will be re-exported by Turkey via the Nabucco 
pipeline, thus making Turkey, instead of Iran, the seller of gas to 
Europe.  It is estimated that if the U.S. police toward Iran 
"softens" until 2014, the U.S. will not object to the plan. 
However, this formula is not expected to work if Iran makes no 
changes regarding its nuclear program, says Aksam. 
 
Turkish and Greek Militaries Will Discuss Aegean Problems at NATO's 
Izmir HQ (Cumhuriyet) 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet cites Greek press reports that, 
through initiatives from the U.S., military delegations from Turkey 
and Greece will discuss on July 21-22 their 'Aegean problems' within 
the frame of 'confidence-building measures' at talks at the NATO 
Headquarters in Izmir.  The outcome of the talks between two 
militaries on "airspace problems" as well as the prevention of 
"human trafficking" will be conveyed to the foreign ministries of 
both countries, reports Cumhuriyet. 
 
Erdogan Holds 'Terror Summit,' Cicek Lashes Out At Yargitay Chair 
Media outlets report Prime Minister Erdogan held Wednesday a meeting 
with five of his cabinet ministers to discuss "terror and security," 
Government Spokesman Cemil Cicek told the press after the gathering. 
 Deputy PMs Cemil Cicek, Ali Babacan, FM Ahmet Davutoglu, Justice 
Minister Sadullah Ergin and Interior Minister Besir Atalay 
participated in the meeting. 
 
In response to the High Court of Appeals (Yargitay) Chairman Hasan 
Gerceker's remarks that civilian trials of military personnel are 
"against the Constitution," Cicek said the Constitutional Court, not 
the High Court of Appeals, decides whether a law violates the 
Constitution.  Cicek alsostressed that Yargitay itself should not 
interfere in the judicial process. 
 
Turkey Aligns With The Non-Aligned (Zaman) 
Islamist-oriented Zaman reports that President Abdullah Gul, for the 
first time, is representing Turkey at the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) 
summit talks in Egypt's Sharm el-Sheikh.  Gul said in a statement to 
the press that such meetings were important opportunities for 
meeting with several NAM countries. 
 
Editorial on President Gul Attending the Non-Aligned Summit in 
Egypt 
 
Erdal Safak wrote in mainstream Sabah: "For the first time ever, a 
Turkish president has attended a summit of the Non-Aligned 
Countries.  Gul's participation in this summit demonstrates Turkey's 
 
ANKARA 00001022  002 OF 003 
 
 
success in pursuing a multi-faceted foreign policy.  Not only have 
the international circumstances changed, but Turkey's internal 
dynamics have changed in order to create a positive atmosphere for 
the highest level representation.   Turkey's President Gul received 
praise from the non-aligned members for the government's approach to 
international matters." 
 
The EU's 'Visa Unfairness' Intensifies against Bosnians, Turks 
(Cumhuriyet) 
Media outlets report that on Wednesday, the European Commission 
proposed allowing the citizens of Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia 
travel to EU countries without visas as of January 1, 2010. 
Citizens of Bosnia-Herzegovina, however, have been excluded from the 
new arrangement because they still don't have 'new passports' 
containing microchips with biometrics data.  On Wednesday, EU 
Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn declined press questions 
regarding the EU's visa-free travel regime implementation for 
Turkish citizens.  Cumhuriyet says despite a visa-free travel regime 
agreement between the EU and Turkey, the EU Commission's decision to 
leave the Turks out of the equation raise questions in the Turkish 
people's minds regarding the EU.  Islamist-oriented Zaman comments, 
"The EU leaves Muslim Bosnians in the cold, again." 
 
Coverage of Secretary Clinton's Speech 
Secretary Clinton's speech last night occurred later than print 
media could report it, but TVs do highlight aspects of the speech 
involving Turkey and Iran.  Mainstream CNN Turk reports, "Clinton 
Dubs Turkey A Rising Power," as "during her speech outlining a new 
approach to foreign policy, Secretary counted Turkey among the 
rising powers," in the world.  Meanwhile, NTV notes, "Clinton 
emphasized during her speech that when it comes to Iran, America's 
door will not always remain open." 
 
Israeli Soldiers Confess to War Crimes in Gaza 
Media feature sensationalist articles regarding reports that some 
Israeli soldiers have confessed to using Palestinians as human 
shields and attacking civilians during their operations in Gaza 
earlier this  year.  In "Frightening Confessions," mainstream 
Milliyet reports, "Israeli soldiers have admitted to being ordered 
to 'strike first, think later.'" Liberal Radikal headlines, "Israeli 
Soldiers Tell Of War Crimes in Gaza" and the article notes "Israeli 
soldiers have confessed to using Palestinians as human shields." 
Mainstream Hurriyet headlines, "We Burned Them Like Ants," while 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak headlines, "We Killed Gazans Like 
Ants." 
 
Designer Miyake Invites Obama to Hiroshima 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports internationally renowned 
Japanese fashion designer Issey Miyake has invited President Obama 
to Hiroshima on the 64th anniversary of the WWII-era bombing 
campaign against the city.  In an own op-ed in The International 
Herald Tribune (IHT), Miyake said such a visit paid by Obama would 
have a "symbolic" meaning regarding the struggle against nuclear 
bombs.  No U.S. President has officially visited Hiroshima and 
Nagazaki after the two Japanese cities were bombed toward the end of 
WWII, says Cumhuriyet.
