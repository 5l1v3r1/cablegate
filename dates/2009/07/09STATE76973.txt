SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING - AFGHANISTAN 
 
¶1.  The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against 
travel to Afghanistan.  The security threat to all 
American citizens in Afghanistan remains critical. 
This supersedes the Travel Warning for Afghanistan 
issued September 10, 2008, to remind U.S. citizens of 
the security risks, including kidnapping. 
 
¶2.  No part of Afghanistan should be considered immune 
from violence, and the potential exists throughout the 
country for hostile acts, either targeted or random, 
against American and other Western nationals at any 
time.  Remnants of the former Taliban regime and the al- 
Qa'ida terrorist network, and other groups hostile to 
International Security Assistance Force (ISAF)/NATO 
military operations, remain active.  There is an ongoing 
threat to kidnap and assassinate U.S. citizens and Non- 
Governmental Organization (NGO) workers throughout the 
country.  Afghan authorities have a limited ability to 
maintain order and ensure the security of citizens and 
visitors.  Travel in all areas of Afghanistan is unsafe 
due to military operations, landmines, banditry, armed 
rivalry among political and tribal groups, and the 
possibility of terrorist attacks, including attacks 
using vehicular or other improvised explosive devices 
(IEDs).  The security environment remains volatile and 
unpredictable. 
¶3.  Kabul is still considered at high risk for militant 
attacks, including rocket attacks, vehicle borne IEDs, 
and suicide bombings.  The number of attacks in the 
south and southeastern areas of the country continues to 
be high as a result of insurgent and drug-related 
activity, but no part of the country is immune from 
attacks.  More than 100 attacks were reported in Kabul 
over the past year, although many additional attacks 
were thwarted by Afghan and coalition forces.  An 
additional 4,400 attacks occurred nationwide during the 
same timeframe. 
 
¶4.  Incidents have occurred with some frequency on the 
Kabul-Jalalabad Road (commonly called Jalalabad Road) 
and Kabul to Bagram Road.  These roads are highly 
restricted for Embassy employees and, if the security 
situation warrants, sometimes prohibited completely. 
 
¶5.  Foreigners throughout the country continue to be 
targeted for violent attacks and kidnappings, whether 
motivated by terrorism or criminal activity.  In January 
2008, gunmen attacked the Serena Hotel and killed eight 
people, including an American contractor and a Norwegian 
journalist.  In April 2008, an assassination attempt 
against Afghan President Karzai showed the continued 
desire of the insurgency to destabilize the Afghan 
government.  The July 2008 bombing of the Indian Embassy 
in downtown Kabul, near many Western embassies and 
Afghan Government institutions, demonstrated the ability 
of the insurgents to undertake assaults within Kabul 
itself.  In February 2009, insurgents launched a complex 
attack on multiple government buildings in Kabul. 
Rocket fire and rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) attacks 
have occurred frequently.  In August 2008, three female 
Western non-governmental organization (NGO) employees, 
along with their male Afghan driver, were gunned down as 
they traveled south of Kabul.  Several American citizens 
were kidnapped in the six-month period between October 
2008 and April 2009. 
 
¶6.  Riots and incidents of civil disturbance can and do 
occur, often without warning.  American citizens should 
avoid rallies and demonstrations; even demonstrations 
intended to be peaceful can turn confrontational and 
escalate into violence. 
 
STATE 00076973  002 OF 002 
 
 
¶7.  Carjackings, robberies and violent crime remain a 
problem.  American citizens involved in property 
disputes -- a common legal problem -- have reported that 
their adversaries in the disputes have threatened their 
lives.  Americans who find themselves in such situations 
cannot assume that either local law enforcement or the 
U.S. Embassy will be able to assist them. 
 
¶8.  From time to time, depending on current security 
conditions, the U.S. Embassy places areas frequented by 
foreigners off limits to its personnel.  Potential 
target areas include key national or international 
government establishments, international organizations 
and other locations with expatriate personnel, and 
public areas popular with the expatriate community. 
Private U.S. citizens are strongly urged to heed these 
restrictions as well and may obtain the latest 
information by consulting the embassy Web site below. 
 
¶9.  The United States Embassy's ability to provide 
emergency consular services to U.S. citizens in 
Afghanistan is limited, particularly for those persons 
outside the capital.  U.S. citizens who choose to visit 
or remain in Afghanistan despite this Travel Warning are 
encouraged to register with the U.S. Embassy through the 
State Department's travel registration Web site, 
https://travelregistration.state.gov, and to obtain 
updated information on travel and security within 
Afghanistan.  Americans without Internet access may 
register directly with the U.S. Embassy.  Registering 
makes it easier for the Embassy to contact Americans in 
case of emergency.  The U.S. Embassy is located at Great 
Masood Road between Radio Afghanistan and the Ministry 
of Public Health (the road is also known as Bebe Mahro 
or Airport Road), Kabul.  The phone number is +93-700- 
108-001 or +93-700-108-002; the Consular Section can be 
reached for after-hours emergencies at +93-700-201-908. 
The Embassy website is http://afghanistan.usembassy.gov. 
 
¶10. Updated information on travel and security in 
Afghanistan may be obtained from the Department of State 
by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll free in the United States 
and Canada or, for callers outside the United States and 
Canada, a regular toll line at 1-202-501-4444.  For 
further information, please consult the Country Specific 
Information for Afghanistan and the current Worldwide 
Caution, which are available on the Bureau of Consular 
Affairs Internet Web site at http://travel.state.gov. 
 
¶11.  Minimize considered.
