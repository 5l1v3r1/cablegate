SUBJECT: TRAVEL WARNING: NIGERIA 
 
¶1. The U.S. Department of State warns U.S. citizens 
of the risks of travel to Nigeria and recommends 
avoiding all but essential travel to the Niger 
Delta states of Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Delta, and 
Rivers.  Violent crime is a problem in Lagos and 
other large cities as well as on the roads between 
cities.  Tension between some Muslim and Christian 
communities, and between ethnic groups, 
occasionally results in violence, but is not 
directed specifically against American citizens. 
This replaces the Travel Warning for Nigeria dated 
December 2, 2008, to note additional areas of 
military operations, violent activity, and crime in 
Nigeria. 
¶2. American citizens should defer all but essential 
travel to the Niger Delta states of Akwa Ibom, 
Bayelsa, Delta, and Rivers because of the continued 
risks of kidnapping, robbery, and other armed 
attacks in these areas, especially against oil- 
related facilities and other infrastructure.  A 
loose alliance of militant groups has conducted a 
number of attacks, mostly in Rivers state, against 
oil installations and posts of the Nigerian 
military's Joint Task Force (JTF), which is 
attempting to close the militant camps.   Since 
January 2008, over 54 foreign national oil workers 
or business people in parts of the Niger Delta 
region have been kidnapped from off-shore and land- 
based oil facilities, residential compounds, and 
public roadways, and similar incidents have 
occurred in several other parts of Nigeria.  The 
Nigerian government considers militant camps and 
surrounding areas in the Delta region states of 
Delta, Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom, and Rivers to be 
conflict areas.  In May 2009, the JTF began 
conducting larger-scale military activities against 
militant camps in Delta State that further 
heightened security concerns in the state.  JTF 
operations could also begin in other parts of the 
Delta region as determined by the Nigerian 
Government.  Travel by foreigners to these areas 
without prior consultation and coordination with 
local security authorities is not recommended, as 
the Nigerian Government may see this activity as 
inappropriate and potentially illegal.  Nigerian 
authorities detained six American citizens, 
including journalists, on six separate occasions, 
in this same region in 2008.  The Nigerian 
government interrogated these Americans for lengthy 
periods without bringing formal charges, and 
ultimately deported them.  Journalists are required 
to obtain a special accreditation from the Ministry 
of Information prior to traveling to conflict areas 
in the Niger Delta region states.  This special 
accreditation is in addition to the general press 
accreditation and valid Nigerian visa required to 
conduct such activities elsewhere in Nigeria. 
¶3. Many foreign oil companies operating in the 
Niger Delta states of Akwa Ibom, Bayelsa, Delta, 
and Rivers have implemented "essential travel only" 
policies for their personnel.  The U.S. Mission 
currently requires advance permission for U.S. 
Government travel to these states, as well as the 
states of Abia, Edo and Imo, given the safety and 
security risk assessments, and the U.S. Embassy or 
Consulate's limited ability to provide assistance 
to people detained by Nigerian authorities in these 
states.  The incidence of kidnappings and other 
armed attacks is on the rise in Abia and Imo 
states.  American citizens who are resident in 
these Niger Delta and southeastern states are 
 
STATE 00075006  002 OF 002 
 
 
advised to review their personal security in light 
of the information contained in this Travel 
Warning. 
¶4. Violent crime committed by individuals and 
gangs, as well as by some persons wearing police 
and military uniforms, is an ongoing problem, 
especially at night.  Crime is particularly acute 
in Lagos.  Traveling outside of major cities during 
hours of darkness is not recommended due to both 
crime and road safety concerns.  Visitors to 
Nigeria, including American citizens, have been 
victims of armed robbery on the airport roads from 
Lagos and Abuja during both daylight and nighttime 
hours.  Some visitors and resident Americans have 
experienced armed muggings, assaults, burglary, 
kidnappings, and extortion, often involving 
violence, as well as carjackings, roadblock 
robberies, and armed break-ins. 
¶5. Religious tension between some Muslim and 
Christian communities occasionally results in acts 
of isolated communal violence that could erupt 
quickly and without warning.  So far, American 
citizens have not been directly targeted.  The 
states of Kano, Kaduna and Plateau are particularly 
volatile.  Rival ethnic groups have clashed 
violently in Delta state around Warri city and in 
North-Central Plateau state. 
¶6. U.S. citizens who travel to or reside in Nigeria 
are strongly advised to register through the State 
Department's travel registration website, 
https://travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs . 
 Americans without Internet access may register 
directly with the nearest U.S. Embassy or 
Consulate. 
By registering, American citizens make it easier 
for the Embassy or Consulate to contact them in 
case of emergency. 
¶7. U.S. citizens should contact the U.S. Embassy in 
Abuja or the U.S. Consulate General in Lagos for 
up-to-date information on any restrictions.  The 
U.S. Embassy in Abuja is open Monday-Thursday 7:30 
a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and Friday 7:30 a.m. to 1:30 
p.m.  The U.S. Consulate General in Lagos is open 
Monday-Thursday from 7:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. and 
Friday 7:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.  The U.S. Embassy in 
Abuja can be contacted by phone at [234](9)461- 
¶4000.  American citizens may contact the U.S. 
Consulate General in Lagos at [234(1)460-3600.  You 
may also visit the U.S. Mission's website at 
http://nigeria.usembassy.gov/. 
 
¶8. U.S. citizens should also consult the Department 
of State's most recent Country Specific Information 
for Nigeria and the Worldwide Caution, which are 
located on the Department's web site at 
http://www.travel.state.gov.  Up-to-date 
information on safety and security can also be 
obtained by calling 1-888-407-4747 toll-free in the 
U.S. and Canada, or by calling a regular toll line, 
1-202-501-4444, from other countries.  These 
numbers are available from 8:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. 
Eastern Time, Monday through Friday (except U.S. 
federal holidays).
