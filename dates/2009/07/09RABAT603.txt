     ¶B. RABAT 0591 (NOTAL) 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On July 10, Charge delivered the demarche on the 
President,s visit to Russia (Ref A) to Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs and Cooperation Secretary General Youssef Amrani, the 
number three in the Ministry.  Amrani appreciated the 
information and was most interested in arms control issues 
since Morocco has worked with the United States and Russia on 
the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) and 
would like to be invited to any arms control conferences (Ref 
B). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Comment:  In general, Morocco maintains a solid, 
balanced, and positive relationship with Russia which is 
growing but still limited.  However, over 12,000 Moroccans 
have studied in Russia since 1956.  In 2008, Morocco imported 
USD 1.58 billion worth the goods from Russia, including 
petroleum, iron, sulphur and cereals; Morocco exported citrus 
and vegetables valued at USD 180 million to Russia.  Morocco 
welcomed 17,000 Russian tourists in 2008 and has made efforts 
to increase that number in 2009.  End Comment.
