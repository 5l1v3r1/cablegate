¶1. (SBU) Summary.  In the July 1 FSC Security Dialogue 
Montenegro Demilitarization Program (MONDEM) Chief Technical 
Advisor Surprenant recounted the progress on its munitions 
demilitarization and storage projects in Montenegro. 
MONDEM's mandate was extended until December 2010, after 
which, the Government of Montenegro is expected to take over 
various projects.  Despite the upbeat assessment, MONDEM is 
still short nearly 3.8 million USD in donations for its 
remaining projects.  MONDEM's ultimate success at closure 
will depend on further donations, while Montenegro's 
prospects for securing and eliminating its remaining surplus 
stocks will depend on the government's ability to make good 
on its pledge to fund programs after 2010. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In WG B, Russia choreographed a less than 
substantive exchange with Kazakhstan on Russia's naval CSBM. 
In WG A, pS tentatively accepted U.S. proposed edits to the 
draft decision on a review of the FSC's document on Small 
Arms and Light Weapons (SALW).  The revision will remain 
under silence until Monday with the expectation that pS will 
meet early Wednesday to join consensus in WG A prior to 
adoption in the plenary.  See request for guidance in para 13 
regarding Turkey's FFT on use of digital cameras and GPS. 
End Summary.

MONDEM Looking for 3.8 Mil USD to Close out Its Program by 
2010

¶3. (SBU) The July 1 Security Dialogue featured a presentation 
by Mr. Pierre Surprenant, Chief Technical Advisor of the 
Montenegro Demilitarization Program (MONDEM), on the status 
of MONDEM's destruction and demilitarization projects. 
Surprenant noted great progress has been in Montenegro, 
specifically with regard to heavy weapons, where reprocessed 
metal from destroyed heavy tanks has netted a reinvestment 
into MONDEM projects of approximately 400K Euro. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Surprenant described two additional on-going 
projects aimed at bringing ammunition storage facilities up 
to NATO standards.  The first, a 1.2 million USD 
refurbishment of a storage facility in Tersa is fully funded 
and expected to be completed in the middle of next year.  The 
second, a larger project in Brezorik, has been more 
problematic owing to the close proximity of the facility to 
housing and a hospital.  MONDEM is also approximately 1.3 
million USD short of the required 1.5 million USD estimated 
cost for the Brezorik project. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Surprenant described MODEM's demilitarization 
program, which aims to establish national capacity for 
sustained elimination of excess ammunition and munitions 
components.  Phase-one of the two-phased project, which is 
currently on-going, consists of the demilitarization of 
munitions and components that do not require special 
equipment (i.e. small arms ammunition, grenades, mines and 
some rocket components.) Phase-two will involve the 
identification of excess munitions and purchase of associated 
special equipment required for their demilitarization.  At an 
estimated cost of 6.5 million USD, MONDEM has received 
 
USOSCE 00000154  002 OF 003 
 
 
donations of approximately 3.7 million USD fro the project. 
Surprenant stated that it is essential for donors to fund the 
additional 2.5 million USD in order for MONDEM to issue the 
tender for Phase-two. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Suprenant noted that the MONDEM's mandate was 
extended until December 31, 2010, at which time MONDEM would 
close.  The government of Montenegro has committed to funding 
national projects at 400K Euro/year, but it is questionable 
whether it will be able to commit to this level of funding 
under current economic pressures. 
 
¶7. (SBU) In subsequent interventions, Montenegro thanked 
MONDEM and donors for assisting Montenegro in eliminating its 
inherited 11,000 tons of excess ammunition and weapons. 
Denmark, speaking as the Chair of the Informal Group of 
Friends for Stockpile Management, asked Surprenant if, given 
the limited funding thus far, it would be practical to break 
MONDEM's demilitarization program down into more digestible 
sub-projects.  The U.S. (Neighbour) described support the 
U.S. has provided to Montenegro for similar destruction 
projects, and asked Surprenant to comment on worrisome 
reports that local support for certain projects may be waning. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Surprenant said it would be difficult to break 
planned projects up into sub-elements, but noted that MONDEM 
might be able to purchase demilitarization equipment as a 
stand-alone project.  The funding requirement would then be 
reduced by an amount equal to the operational costs. 
Surprenant said he would submit such a plan once the 
equipment requirements were identified. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Turning to the U.S. question, Surprenant 
acknowledged U.S. efforts and noted MONDEM's close, 
cooperative relationship with the U.S.'s contractors in 
Montenegro.  The main difference between the projects, he 
noted, is that the U.S. is eliminating very large munitions 
(up to 300 KG) and is eliminating munitions by demolition, 
while MONDEM is currently eliminating small munitions.  In 
addition, he said the local population near the U.S. 
destruction site had been exposed some time ago to an 
unrelated event at a civilian plant.  The resulting explosion 
damaged houses up to five KM away and, as a result of this 
traumatic event, the local population is very sensitive. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Luxembourg provided a very brief report on the 
recent Donor's visit to Tajikistan.  The full report, which 
details a successful OSCE project on stockpile management and 
security, was distributed under FSC.DEL/132/09.

Russia Choreographs Discussion on Its Naval CSBM 
- - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - 
 
¶10. (SBU) In Working Group B, Russia promoted its Naval CSBM, 
noting that contrary to popular opinion, Russia is open to 
suggestions from other pS on how to improve it.  On cue, 
Kazakhstan asked Russia for a clarification on Section I 
point 2 of the exchange on naval information*specifically 
the amount of water displacement for surface ships and 
submarines.  Russia thanked Kazakhstan for its comments and 
promised to revise the draft accordingly. No other pS 
commented.

Group Accepts U.S. Edits on SALW DD--DEC Expected July 8 
- - - - - - - -  - - - - - - - 
 
¶11. (SBU) In Working Group A Denmark, France, Belgium, 
Russia, Luxemburg and Sweden offered support for the draft 
decision on a meeting to review the OSCE SALW document. 
Belarus supported the draft decision but also proposed 
expanding the title of Session II to Brokering "and Export" 
controls.  Schweizer, as Chair of the informal Group of 
Friends, used Belarus' proposal as an opening to introduce 
the remaining U.S. edits, which USDel provided in advance to 
Germany.  Schweizer proposed that the draft decision, 
including the aforementioned edits, be placed under an 
informal silence procedure until Monday, July 6. Unless 
silence is broken, pS will meet on Wednesday before the 
plenary in a special WG A session to join consensus on the 
draft (FSC.DD/4/09/Rev.1).  The Chair, Switzerland and the 
U.S. (Meyer) welcomed the German proposal.  Meyer delivered 
points per reftel regarding U.S. expectations for the meeting 
and U.S. intentions to provide an expert from capital. 
 
¶12. (SBU) Germany announced on behalf of the Chair that it 
had received a number of edits on its proposal regarding 
verification activity briefings (FSC.DD/5/09).  A new 
revision will be distributed once final comments are 
received, likely from Russia later this week.  Further 
discussion on this draft is not expected until those pS that 
provided comments have a chance to meet informally. 
 
¶13. (SBU) The UK announced it expects to issue a revision to 
its joint proposal with Russia on a Best Practice Guide for 
implementation of Chapter IV, "Contacts" (FSC.AIAM/8/09). 
Ukraine noted that issues with Ukrainian legislation prevent 
it from supporting Turkey's proposal on digital cameras and 
GPS (FSC.DEL/124/09).  In response to a French intervention 
noting that Ukraine could provide its own GPS for use, 
Belarus reminded pS that its legislation not only restricts 
the use of GPS, but also the data produced by GPS.  Belarus 
proposed changing the operative word in the decision from 
"decides" to "encourages," which would allow pS to implement 
the decision in accordance with national regulations. 
Encouraged by the discussion of edits, Turkey requested that 
the Chair replace Turkey's FFT on the agenda with a draft 
decision so that pS might begin discussing substantive edits. 
 Mission requests guidance on FSC.DEL/124/09.
