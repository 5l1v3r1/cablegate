Title- Alliance for Change 
 
Op-ed inliberal Folha de S. Paulo (7-7) co-authored by Preidents 
Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Nicolas Sarkozy states: 
"...International financial institutions, like the IMF and the World 
Bank, need to gie more weight to the more dynamic emerging 
economes during their decisionmaking processes.  The decisions 
made at the [lat] G20 summit should also be put into practice..... 
The threat of protectinism gathered new force with the crisis. 
WTO's Dha Round Trade talk conclsion is an urgent task in order to 
reach an ambiious, ample and balanced deal that can benefit 
developing countries above all.... so that it strengthens commercial 
multilateralism....An extensive pocess to change the United Nations 
Security Council in order to ensure a more balanced and 
comprehensive international order should be discussed.....Other 
challenges also threaten peace and development.  Climate change 
imposes an enormous test on global governance...... Other global 
challenges include organized and transnational crime; terrorism; 
drug and people trafficking; pandemics and food security....Brazil 
and France want to offer to the world its joint view of a new 
multilateralism, adapted to a multi-polar world.  We cannot deal 
with the problems of the 21st century with institutions that are a 
legacy of the 20th century.  Together with other world leaders we 
need to forge an 'Alliance for Change'....." 
 
Title- Obama Government playing dead; Brazil should act 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (7-7) by Folha's columnist Marcos 
Nobre notes: "...We don't see Brazil seeking a negotiated solution 
for the conflict [in Honduras].  And the reason is simple: Brazil is 
not doing anything because it believes that the U.S. recovered its 
place as the uncontested leader of the Americas...This may be true 
on the whole but not in the case of Honduras.  Obama's government 
may say that it decided to take a prudent stance and that it sought 
to reinforce the OAS's institutional role, but the fact is that it 
decided to play dead......By entering directly in the conflict the 
U.S. could be accused of abusing its military and economic power 
against a small banana republic.  If it sticks to its dubious 
stance, it may be considered an opportunist that doesn't truly 
defend democracy......The tardy and irrelevant OAS strategy of 
ultimatums is wasted.  A confrontation is imminent.  And Obama's 
government simply washed its hands [of the situation].  And it is 
exactly at this point, with a lack of action by the U.S. 
administration, that Brazil should reappear and show why it is 
there...."
