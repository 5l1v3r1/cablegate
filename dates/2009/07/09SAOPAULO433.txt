¶1.  (U) Post has continued its Muslim engagement through a 
series of consultations in the wake of President Obama's June 
4 Cairo Speech (Ref A).  While much remains to be done, we 
have come up with a tentative road map of initiatives, 
starting with the simplest and moving to more complex, to 
increase engagement with Brazil's Muslim communities per 
request Ref B in coordination with our broader outreach 
program and diversity objectives. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) In preparing this cable, a range of Arab and Muslim 
interlocutors were consulted (Ref A).  From these and prior 
discussions, we have developed a range of ideas.  We see each 
of these proposed programs as having appeal to non-Muslim as 
well as Muslim audiences and intend, wherever possible, to 
make our outreach efforts broad and designed for multiple 
constituencies.  Brief descriptions of our proposals follow. 
 
Consular Open House/Companion Social Event 
 
¶3.  (SBU) There exists considerable anxiety about obtaining 
U.S. non-immigrant visas within the Muslim community and, 
according to Sheik Jihad Hammadeh, significant cynicism. 
Muslims whose applications are denied tue to an inabilty to 
voercome 2154(b) of the NIA or delayed tue to adminsitrative 
processing often become convinced that their failure to get a 
visa resulted from political considerations.  To allay these 
fears, build trust and to extend something of possible 
concrete benefit to the Islamic Community, we are working on 
setting up a Consular Open House, in which we would invite 
Muslim representatives to tour the Consular Section, prepare 
a presentation on the visa application process for them and 
then invite them to a social event afterward.  The Consular 
Section is also eager to send out speakers to do information 
outreach to Muslim audiences as it does for other special 
interest groups, including business, universities and travel 
agencies, further allaying anxieties and multiplying our 
contacts in the Muslim community by providing useful, 
practical information for travelers. 
 
Obama Presentation for Muslim Youth 
 
¶4.  (U) For several months, post has employed an Obama 
Outreach PowerPoint on the President,s life that has proven 
highly popular with a wide range of general audiences (Ref 
C).  We have proposed to our Muslim interlocutors that we 
could re-orient this presentation to emphasize the positive 
contacts that the President has had with various Muslim 
communities throughout his life.  So far, the response has 
been positive.  Fundamentalist Sheik Hammadeh said that such 
a presentation could work for other Sheiks (Ref A).  Moderate 
Sheik Al-Boustani who teaches a 70-person Arabic language and 
Islam religious class responded enthusiastically, and offered 
to have the presentation done for his students.  This kind of 
encounter would be an ideal way to grow our contacts with the 
Muslim community at a person-to-person level and to expand 
our reach into a sub-set of Brazilian youth, since many of 
Boustaini's students are younger generation persons. 
 
¶5.  (U) Using materials we have at Post, we could also offer 
a U.S. History-based presentation/panel discussion on 
"American Spirituality" or "U.S. Faith Diversity" that would 
talk about the wide variety of faiths represented in the U.S. 
and their impact on the development of the U.S.   Such an 
event would be of interest to Muslims and non-Muslims, 
including evangelical Christians and others.  Such an event 
would also have an integrating function, bringing together a 
wide variety of contacts and ensuring that our Muslim 
outreach had a multiplier effect with other groups.  This 
could be a lead-in event to inviting down a prominent scholar 
of American Religion who could present on the same topic. 
Publications 
 
 
SAO PAULO 00000433  002 OF 002 
 
 
¶6.  (U) Muslim organizations in Brazil have some small-scale 
publications.  We plan to inventory the publications and then 
consider programs to send editors and others to the U.S. 
and/or look to them as possible outlets for interviews with 
Mission personnel. 
 
Greater Contact: Cyber and Personal 
 
¶7.  (U) Moderate representative Mohammed al-Zoghbi and Sheik 
Al-Boustani suggested that we should look to send 
representatives of the Muslim community to visit the United 
States and meet with Muslims and non-Muslims.  We would 
propose sending such persons on visitor programs, who could 
return to Brazil and give talks on Muslim life in the U.S. 
Such presentations would counter myths and negative images 
about the United States. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) Another theme that a variety of our religious 
interlocutors emphasized, from fundamentalist to moderates, 
was their dissatisfaction with the scholarly level of 
Brazil's Muslims.  They lamented the lack of Islamic learning 
in Brazil and the language barriers that make scholarly 
advance difficult (few knowledgeable Sheiks speak Portuguese 
and few Brazilians speak Arabic).  Both fundamentalists and 
moderates saw the U.S. Muslim Community as more theologically 
advanced than their own and wanted greater contact.  During 
his June 30 visit, SP Special Assistant Jared Cohen suggested 
to Sheik Jihad Hammadeh that Washington could help create 
cyber-spaces to facilitate communication with U.S. Muslims 
(Ref A).  Post is looking at various options, which could 
include hosting webchats or linking Muslim communities here 
to counterpart communities in the U.S.  Hammadeh wanted those 
contacts to be limited to Sheiks, though the cyber-forums 
would lend themselves naturally to a more free-wheeling kind 
of contact.  To build sophisticated, flexible cyber-links 
between Brazilian and U.S. Muslim communities, Post would 
need Washington support. 
 
A Strategic Visit by Religious Scholars 
 
¶9.  (SBU) As a longer-term project, we might also consider 
inviting a U.S.-based renowned Muslim scholar to visit Brazil 
along with other non-Muslim scholars and perhaps a younger 
American Muslim accustomed to working the United States' 
multi-religious atmosphere.  Such persons could become the 
focus of a conference or meeting aimed at Muslims and 
non-Muslims to discuss religious diversity in the United 
States, with a special breakout gathering for Muslims most 
interested in advanced theology.  This might be undertaken 
first as an cyber meeting or as a multi-country program to 
save on costs.  As noted in Reftel A, non-Muslim Brazilians 
regard our attempts our outreach favorably, so such an event 
should be designed to appeal to both Muslim and non-Muslim 
Brazilian publics.
