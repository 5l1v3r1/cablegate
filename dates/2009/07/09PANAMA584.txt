INVESTMENT SURVEY 
 
REF: STATE 60543 
 
¶1. (U) This cable is in response to reftel. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Post obtained from the Ministry of Commerce and 
Industries a list of every Panamanian business that exported 
under the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBERA) as 
amended by the Caribbean Basin Trade Partnership Act (CBTPA). 
 All 145 businesses were called by phone and we emailed all 
businesses from which we were able to obtain email addresses. 
 We received data from only six businesses.  The data are in 
the following format: 
 
¶A. NAME OF COMPANY 
¶B. INVESTMENT AMOUNT 
¶C. IS THIS A NEW INVESTMENT OR EXPANSION INVESTMENT 
¶D. TYPE OF PRODUCT TO BE EXPORTED 
¶E. ESTIMATED VALUE OF EXPORTS TO THE UNITED STATES

¶3. (SBU) The GOP strongly believes that the CBERA promotes 
Panamanian exports to the United States and promotes job 
creation in Panama.  However, there is a lack of hard data 
for any broad conclusions; the data above are too limited to 
make statistical inferences.  However, the self-reported 
estimated value of exports to the United States for just 
these six companies, over twelve million dollars, is a 
substantial percentage of the $377 million in Panamanian 
exports to the United States in 2008.
