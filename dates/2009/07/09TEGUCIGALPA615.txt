SUBJECT: TFHO1: THE AMBASSADOR'S MEETING WITH DEFENSE CHIEF 
VASQUEZ 
 
REF: A/S SHANNON-AMBASSADOR LLORENS TELCON 07/16/09 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Hugo Llorens, reason 1.4 (b & d) 
 
¶1. (S/NF) Summary: The Ambassador and DATT met with Honduran 
Chief of Defense (CHOD) MG Romeo Vasquez Velasquez to press 
the importance of the de facto regime's serious participation 
in the Arias-led negotiations on July 18, as well as the 
repercussions if the talks do not show substantive progress. 
The Ambassador reiterated the firm USG position that the 
democratic and constitutional order be restored rapidly. 
Vasquez agreed to deliver this message to de facto regime 
President Micheletti.  Vasquez expressed his own willingness 
to support a negotiated resolution and restoration of 
President Zelaya, but noted the armed forces were concerned 
that civilian politicians would make them the scapegoat for 
the coup and crisis.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (S/NF) The Ambassador and DATT met with Vasquez at a 
neutral location in accordance with Department guidance 
(Ref).  The Ambassador informed Vasquez he was under 
instructions to make a major effort to reach out to key 
Honduran political, business and civil society figures to 
convince them of the critical importance that the de facto 
Micheletti regime engage in serious negotiations in the next 
mediation round sponsored by President Arias on June 18 in 
San Jose.  He reiterated the U.S. and international community 
insistence that the democratic and constitutional order be 
re-established and that the legitimate President of Honduras, 
Manuel Zelaya, be restored to office.  The Ambassador 
stressed the Arias mediation effort offered the most viable 
diplomatic channel to restore the democratic order but also 
took into consideration the concerns of Zelaya's opponents 
and the de facto regime's supporters. 
 
¶3. (S/NF) The Ambassador expressed concern that failure to 
make substantive progress on July 18 could result in the 
collapse of the Arias effort, which would bring about 
significant negative consequences for Honduras and only 
assure the international community would take a harder line. 
The Ambassador also stressed that failure to resolve the 
crisis soon would force the USG to adopt punitive measures 
against both the de facto regime and the individuals 
responsible for the coup and the continuation of the crisis. 
(Note: Unstated but understood was the likelihood of the 
revocation of visas for individuals the USG deemed culpable 
for the crisis.  End note.) 
 
¶4. (S/NF) The Ambassador underscored the longstanding support 
and friendship the USG and the people of the United States 
held for Honduras.  He said the United States had always 
valued Honduras as a democratic ally, and that the United 
States remained firm in its commitment to democracy in 
Honduras.  He noted the restoration of the democratic order 
would allow for normalization of bilateral relations and 
mil-mil cooperation.  He urged Vasquez to approach the de 
facto regime leadership and Micheletti himself to press them 
on the importance of engaging in serious negotiations under 
the Arias effort. 
 
¶5. (S/NF) Vasquez initially discussed the armed forces' 
(HOAF) effort to avoid being dragged into the political 
crisis caused by President Zelaya's struggle with his 
opponents over his desired referendum, i.e. the "Fourth Urn." 
 But in the end, he said, the HOAF had been manipulated by 
all sides.  Vasquez attempted to justify the coup action, 
asserting that the military was simply following the orders 
of the Supreme Court on June 28.  He said he had always been 
loyal to President Zelaya but the Supreme Court's order was 
constitutional.  Vasquez then lamented that Micheletti and 
his advisors were the same people who were unable to show 
flexibility before the events of June 28, stubborn and 
aggressive.  Vasquez said Micheletti and his core team 
continue to take a hard line. Nevertheless, after extensive 
discussion Vasquez agreed that in the interest of the 
Honduran people and U.S. relations he would go to Micheletti 
 
TEGUCIGALP 00000615  002 OF 002 
 
 
and convey the Ambassador's message.  Vasquez added the 
timing of the Ambassador's visit was opportune, because he 
would be going directly to a meeting at the Presidential 
Palace to discuss the negotiating strategy for July 18. 
 
¶6. (S/NF) Speaking in general about the current situation, 
Vasquez noted the most difficult obstacle for the success of 
the mediation was the almost pathological fear of Zelaya and 
his association with Venezuelan President Chavez, held not 
only by the leadership of the de facto regime, but of the 
overwhelming majority of their supporters.  While Vasquez 
understood the diplomatic balance sheet argued for supporting 
the Arias process, an early return of Zelaya could weaken 
Honduran democratic institutions.  He added that while the 
threatening rhetoric of Chavez and Zelaya was intense, his 
own view was that Zelaya's support was on the decline in the 
country.  Vasquez said HOAF intelligence revealed that a 
significant amount of Venezuelan funding was pouring into 
social sectors to build support for the pro-Zelaya movement, 
but that nationwide no more than 7,500 people were 
participating in the week's pro-Zelaya demonstrations, 
indicating waning support. 
 
¶7. (S/NF) Comment: Vasquez seems torn but we believe he is 
looking for the U.S. to help him find a way out and will 
carry our message to the Micheletti camp.  What is also clear 
is that the HOAF is increasingly concerned they will be left 
holding the bag or made into the villain in this crisis. 
Whatever deal is made, the military leadership must be kept 
in the loop in order for it to succeed.  End comment.
