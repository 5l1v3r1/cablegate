Germany rose by 21 cases to a total of 548 on July 7. Berlin 
confirms more infections.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  The National Reference Center for Influenza at the 
Robert Koch Institute (RKI) announced in its press briefing 
July 7 a total of 25 new laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1, 
and subtracted four previously confirmed cases.  This net 
increase of twenty-one cases brings the total number of virus 
cases in Germany to 548. Four H1N1 infections previously 
confirmed in the states of Schleswig-Holstein and Bavaria were 
rescinded. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  North Rhine-Westphalia remains the state with the 
highest number of virus cases among all German states with a 
total of 265, followed by Baden-Wuerttemberg (78) and Bavaria 
(62 cases).  The Federal State of Saarland remains the only 
state without confirmed virus cases.  Over half (307) of all 
confirmed infections in Germany have resulted from domestic 
transmission. 
 
¶4. (SBU)  Media reports indicate that the number of infected 
students at the Alexander von Humboldt Gymnasium in Berlin has 
incrQsed to a  total of twelve. As reported in Ref A, the 
school will remain closed for this week.  Berlin health 
officials said that a total of 80 students have been tested 
and results are expected shortly.  A school in the Bavarian 
city of Bayreuth will also remain closed this week as two 
students tested positive for the virus.  In addition, five 
laboratory workers at the Dresden university hospital have 
reportedly been diagnosed with the virus. In all confirmed 
virus infections that we are aware of, the symptoms are 
reportedly mild.
