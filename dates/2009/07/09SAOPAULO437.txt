Title- Time to retaliate 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S. Paulo (7-19) states: "The time has 
come for the Lula administration to change its attitude towards its 
relationship with Argentina, its main partner in Mercosul and 
Brazil's third major trading partner.....The adoption of trade 
barriers that could at least threaten Argentines' sales to 
Brazil....are now imperative to convince its partner to negotiate 
and to review its attitudes....."
