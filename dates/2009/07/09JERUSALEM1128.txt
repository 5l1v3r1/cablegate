Main Stories:

Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, Al-Ayyam and Al-Quds report on statements made 
by Palestinian Authority expressing disappointment that the 
Palestinian factions did not reach any agreement to end their 
internal conflict during the last round of talks that concluded in 
Cairo on June 30. According to a statement issued by the Palestinian 
Authority Presidency (July 1), Abbas reiterated that all Palestinian 
factions must commit to and give consideration to the national 
interests.  Additionally, Abbas endorsed a series of decisions 
aiming to eliminate all obstacles to the national unity agreement. 
Abbas acknowledged the role Egypt is playing in support of the unity 
talks, and praised their determination to ending the division. 
 
Al-Quds' front page report on comments made by sources in the 
Israeli security offices, concerning Israel's recent announcement to 
annex the Palestinian lands of Nabi Mousa and Dead Sea to the Maale 
Adumim settlement. According to these sources, registering the 
Palestinian lands of the Nabi Mousa and the Dead Sea to Maali Adumim 
settlement will be made under the claim of protecting these lands 
from confiscation by "commercial" entities.  The PLO chief 
negotiator Erikat noted in an interview with the Israeli daily 
Haaretz (July 1) that the Palestinian Authority rejects these 
Israeli measures; furthermore, the confiscation of more Palestinian 
lands for the purpose of constructing new settlements contravenes 
President Obama's demand to stop all settlement activities.  It is 
also reported that Erikat contacted the US, EU and Russia about the 
planned annexation. 
 
Al-Quds front-page contains conflicting analyses of the meeting 
between Israeli Defense Minister Barak and Senator Mitchell in New 
York. While some analyses are optimistic about progress and 
rapprochement being achieved between the Israelis and US 
administration, other analyses, including the Israeli daily Yedioth 
Ahronoth, noted that gaps in their relative positions have not been 
bridged. In related news, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports on comments 
made by Barak concerning a temporary halt of settlement activities 
in the new settlements, as a response to US efforts in achieving a 
comprehensive peace process that will include all Arab nations. 
 
The lead photo of Al-Quds is of a Palestinian child being 
transferred to a hospital in the Nablus area (July 1) for treatment 
of injuries caused by Israeli forces.  The child and three others 
were injured in confrontations with Israeli forces near the Kfar 
Tuppuah settlement, south of Nablus. 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front page reports on the meeting between 
Palestinian Authority President Abbas and the EU Special Peace Envoy 
to the Middle East, Marc Outte. The President explored ways to 
compel Israel into accepting the two-state solution and resuming 
negotiations. Abbas called on the EU envoy to exert pressure on all 
relevant parties to respect road map obligations. 
 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reports on the announcement of 
Palestinian Authority Minister of Public Works Ishtayeh (July 1) of 
a US donation of $70 million to support road-construction projects 
in the West Bank. This announcement was made during a meeting in 
Jenin with the Jenin governor and senior officials. 
 
Al-Quds front page reports on the results of an opinion poll 
conducted by the Arab World Center for Research and Development 
(AWRAD), to assess the satisfaction of Palestinians with President 
Obama's policy towards the Palestinian issue. According to the poll, 
 
JERUSALEM 00001128  002 OF 002 
 
 
23.8% of the Palestinians are satisfied with Obama's policy, and are 
more optimistic from Obama's visit to the region than they had been 
during the Bush administration. The results also indicate that a 
large percentage of Palestinians are waiting to see actions --  not 
just words. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reported in inside coverage a USG-sponsored 
participation of a U.S. musician in coordinating a youth orchestra, 
in partnership with a local NGO in the West Bank. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida reported in inside coverage a USAID-sponsored 
event (July 1) in which the USAID mission director and the 
Palestinian Authority Minister of Education granted "rule of law 
awards" to Palestinian students.-------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Al-Quds, "We are fed up with this dialogue" (07/02): "All 
Egyptian efforts declined in pushing the Palestinian  national 
dialogue forward and did not achieve  any progress; the July 7 date 
was not met; a new date has been set, which is again not a final 
date and can always be extended or changed... we are really tired of 
this dialogue, we should put an end to our conflicts and make use of 
the new era which seems very promising given Obama's positive 
engagement in the region." 
 
2) Hafeth Barghouti, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, "Settlements" (07/02): 
"Whoever wants peace shouldn't put a scheme to demolish 20,000 
Palestinian homes leaving 180,000 Palestinians without shelter for 
no reason; whoever wants peace shouldn't confiscate 6% of the 
Palestinian land to build the separation wall; whoever wants peace 
e 
shouldn't allow  800,000 settlers to live in the West Bank; whoever 
wants peace shouldn't bring half a million Jews from all over the 
world to live in the West Bank...we should not beg for peace, peace 
must be imposed by our determination and resistance."
