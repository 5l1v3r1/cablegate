Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
Al-Quds leads with news that several rightist Israeli groups entered 
the Al-Aqsa mosque compound on July 30 under the full protection of 
the Israeli police. The report notes that the Islamic Endowment 
(Waqf) office which oversees the compound condemned the Israeli 
action and called on Muslims to gather at the Al-Aqsa mosque to 
confront any future infringement by the groups. 
 
Al-Quds runs front page coverage citing a July 29 New York Times 
report that Jewish settlers intend to continue challenging the Obama 
administration by constructing more outposts in the Palestinian 
Territories. The report highlights that 11 new outposts have been 
constructed over the past few days. In related news, Al-Hayat 
Al-Jadida runs a front page photo of Jewish settlers protesting in 
Jerusalem on July 30 and holding banners that read "Obama: Remove 
your hands from Jerusalem and the Land of Israel." 
 
All dailies run coverage of the participation of Palestinian 
Authority (PA) Prime Minister Salam Fayyad, US Consul General Jacob 
Walles, and USAID Mission Director Howard Sumka in the inauguration 
of the new public library in the West Bank town of Beit Jala on July 
Â¶30. The reports note that Walles reiterated that the US is committed 
to helping the Palestinian people implement projects that will help 
build an independent Palestinian state. The dailies noted that Prime 
Minister Fayyad and the USAID mission director also opened a USAID 
funded public park in Al-Khass village near the West Bank city of 
Bethlehem. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Ayyam lead with news that Hamas 
"kidnapped" 19 Fatah members who were supposed to attend the Sixth 
Fatah Party Congress in Bethlehem, scheduled to begin on August 4. 
Fatah security officials stated that if Hamas continues with these 
measures, Fatah will arrest Hamas members in the West Bank. Al-Ayyam 
reports that a number of countries are urging Hamas to let the Fatah 
members attend the conference. Al-Quds runs front page news that 
Turkey has refused to mediate between Fatah and Hamas on this issue. 
 
 
Al-Ayyam front pages news citing Wafa News Agency that Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will continue the policy of the previous 
Israeli government concerning the Gaza closure. Netanyahu is quoted 
in Israeli daily Maariv saying that he will not open the borders of 
Gaza until kidnapped Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit is released. The 
report also notes that Netanyahu shared this position with US 
National Security Advisor James Jones during their recent meeting. 
 
Al-Ayyam reports on Israeli sources noting that Israeli officials 
will visit Washington next month to pursue talks with the US 
regarding the peace process and the Iranian nuclear 
program.------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
1) Samih Shbeib opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
title, "Will there be an upcoming international conference?" 
(07/31): "The US position has not changed at all concerning the 
e 
cessation of settlement activity and road map obligations, which 
indicates that the Obama administration is keen to protect its 
credibility and achieve a significant change in the US-Arab 
relationship... This determination will definitely lead to convening 
 
JERUSALEM 00001308  002 OF 002 
 
 
an international peace conference in the Middle East and will force 
Israel to engage in a comprehensive peace process." 
 
2) Yahia Rabah opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily under the 
title "The Sixth Conference" (07/31): "I still hope that Hamas will 
allow Fatah members to leave Gaza and attend the Fatah Party 
Congress in Bethlehem, which has not been held for more than 20 
years...If Hamas does not allow the Fatah members to leave Gaza, 
what is the difference between Hamas and Israel?"
