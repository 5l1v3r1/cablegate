¶1. Consulate FSN met with Natalya Astafyeva, ex-wife of 
currently detained anti-corruption fighter Aleksandr Astafyev, 
on July 23 to discuss her ex-husband's case.  She informed FSN 
that a special commission has been sent from MVD headquarters in 
Moscow to Vladivostok to investigate Astafyev's case.  The 
commission will be working on behalf of the prosecution, so 
Astafyeva does not expect objectivity.  She sees it as a good 
sign, however, that the investigators came from Moscow instead 
of the regional headquarters in Khabarovsk, since it was that 
office which brought the original charges against him. 
 
¶2.  She expressed confidence in lawyer Yaroslav Gerin that he is 
using all his contacts here and in Moscow to help his client. 
Gerin is a familiar face to the Consulate and came to our 
attention during his legal defense of journalist Grigoriy Pasko 
in late 1990s.  Pasko had been reporting on Russian Navy ships 
that were leaking nuclear waste into the Sea of Japan.  After 
selling an incriminating video to Japanese broadcaster NHK, he 
was convicted of espionage and served seven years in jail. 
 
¶3.  Astafyeva told FSN that her ex-husband was able to call her 
from the detention center and that he hopes to immigrate to the 
U.S., since he feels that Russia will not be safe for him even 
if he is somehow acquitted.  She expressed gratitude when 
informed by FSN that that Moscow and Washington are aware of the 
case and that the Washington Post has covered it.  She did not 
report problems or harassment against family members, including 
her son, who is currently serving in a low level position with 
the Border Guard Service.
