  Editorial Quotes

¶1. XINJIANG RIOT 
 
a. "By being extreme, western media loses China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (07/10): "China is changing, but western 
media's attitude towards China seems forever unchanged.  When the 
'7.5' incident happened, western media chose to support the other 
side, opposing the Chinese people. Some did this out of confusion 
while others did this because of vicious motives.  In the last year 
or so, China has made significant progress on the opening-up of its 
information.  Regretfully, the western media can't adapt to this new 
change.  Their reports are full of indiscriminate copies, and their 
articles full of platitudes.  They use a fixed set of molds to deal 
with all the issues.  They created their conclusions long ago, and 
with each new incident they search for material to prove their 
conclusions.  This practice by Western media makes the Chinese 
people, who know the truth, angry and scared.  Similarly, it deepens 
the Western public's misunderstanding or even hatred of China. They 
do not know the truth. Prejudice is farther away from the truth than 
ignorance; the Chinese people do not trust Western media because of 
their prejudice." 
 
b. "Why I no longer read the Wall Street Journal" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(07/10): "Starting today, I [Ding Gang, an 
experienced media personality in Beijing] will no longer read the 
Wall Street Journal.  I will also ask all my friends and colleagues 
not to read it.  In the past 10 years, I was a faithful reader of 
the Wall Street Journal. However, the paper's reports concerning 
China over the years continuously disappointed me.  Although their 
reports and commentary on China in recent years carry a lot of 
prejudice and ignorance, their financial news and commentary still 
has its value.  But this time, their reporting on the Xinjiang riots 
has really gone too far.  I cannot stand it; the paper publicly 
stood at the side of the terrorists and become their advocate.  They 
call Uygur rioters "demonstrators" yet label Han people "thugs". 
Maybe the editors at the Wall Street Journal can defend themselves 
by saying they are simply being fair and impartial.  I feel 
humiliated after reading this.  I can bear prejudice but never 
humiliation.  I will not debate or argue with the Wall Street 
Journal, the advocate for terrorism, I will just give up reading it. 
 To me, it is out of sight and out of mind.  From today on, I will 
say "thank you" to any Chinese person who neither reads nor writes 
for Wall Street Journal. " 
 
¶2. NORTH KOREA 
 
"South Korea wants to set up a cyber war command office to fight 
against North Korea" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao) (07/10): "South Korean intelligence agencies 
and media accuse North Korea and its supporters of North Korea of 
being attackers. Some people claim that it is the Chinese hackers 
who usually use this kind of attack method. This presumption is 
questioned by many experts and media. They hold that currently, 
there is no evidence to prove this point of view. Chinese experts 
indicate that setting up a cyber war command office is a pre-decided 
thing. However, South Korea should not use North Korea or China as 
an excuse. It is ridiculous that South Korea and other western 
countries, when developing their own military strength, look to 
China or North Korea as their supposed target."
