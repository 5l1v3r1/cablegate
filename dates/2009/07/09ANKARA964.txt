¶1. Econoff delivered reftel talking points to Emra Topcu at 
MFA's Directorate General of International Political 
Organizations.  He informed us that Turkey would be 
represented at the ITSO Extraordinary Assembly by Ahmet 
Calik, Senior Expert at Turksat, the independent agency 
responsible for Turkey's satellite policy.  Topcu noted that 
he would pass the points along to Calik and that Turkey would 
consider our position in developing its own stance. 
 
¶2. Separately, Ambassador Jeffrey met with Transportation 
Minister Binali Yildirim on July 6 and delivered the same 
message (Turksat falls under the Ministry of Transportation). 
 The Minister also noted that the points would be passed to 
Turksat, but offered no substantive response.
