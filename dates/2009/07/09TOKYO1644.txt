SUBJECT: A/S CAMPBELL MEETS DPJ SECRETARY GENERAL OKADA 
 
Classified By: Charge d'Affaires, a.i., James P. Zumwalt per 1.4 (b/d) 
 
¶1. (C) Summary:  Opposition DPJ Secretary General Katsuya 
Okada told EAP A/S Kurt Campbell July 17 that, in the event 
of an opposition victory in the next election, his party will 
need a strong relationship with the United States to remain 
in power.  That said, the DPJ will need to address issues 
frankly with the United States and, by overcoming ""obstacles"" 
in the relationship, the two countries can maintain a strong 
alliance for the next 30-50 years.  Although the DPJ has made 
policy pronouncements on a number of important bilateral 
issues, such as Futenma replacement and SOFA revision, once 
in power it will approach these matters only after thorough 
dialogue with the USG.  A/S Campbell pledged that the USG 
will remain neutral and respectful in the run-up to Japan's 
election, urged the DPJ not to espouse positions that make it 
seem anti-American and invited the party to continue to 
pursue close dialogue with the USG in both Tokyo and 
Washington.  End Summary. 
 
¶2. (C) EAP Assistant Secretary Kurt Campbell met for 30 
minutes July 17 with Democratic Party of Japan Secretary 
General Katsuya Okada.  Noting that this was their fifth 
meeting, A/S Campbell expressed gratitude for the opportunity 
to begin a dialogue with the DPJ.  With a general election 
likely to take place on August 30 -- and most polls showing 
the DPJ in a strong position -- the USG will take care to be 
neutral and respectful, A/S Campbell said.  To ensure that 
the USG and the DPJ fully understand each other and to 
encourage a constructive and respectful exchange of policy 
views, we must remain in close contact in the coming weeks. 
In the event that the DPJ takes power, the USG will do its 
utmost to be a reliable partner, and we are confident that we 
can maintain a strong relationship with a new government.  In 
particular, we want to ensure that the new government's 
leadership is well aware of USG positions regarding regional 
and global issues, such as North Korea, China, Afghanistan 
and Pakistan, A/S Campbell said. 
 
¶3. (C) Okada replied that he and his party believe strongly 
in the U.S.-Japan relationship, in spite of what some in the 
media report.  There are many issues for the DPJ and U.S. 
Government to discuss, and DPJ leader Yukio Hatoyama -- who 
will ""undoubtedly"" be the DPJ's Prime Minister -- is looking 
forward to building a fruitful relationship with Secretary 
Clinton and President Obama.  The DPJ's goal is to ""overcome 
obstacles"" in our bilateral relationship to ensure that our 
Alliance remains strong for the next 30 to 50 years.  As the 
opposition, the DPJ has formulated many policies on issues 
important to the Alliance, such as Futenma replacement, SOFA 
revision and the refueling dispatch in support of Operation 
Enduring Freedom.  That said, once in power, the DPJ does not 
plan to move forward at once on all these policies.  Instead, 
the new government will endeavor to build a trusting 
relationship with the USG and, through dialogue, will decide 
on the proper order to discuss these issues. 
 
¶4. (C) Noting the busy schedule of high-level events in the 
months ahead, A/S Campbell said that a new DPJ government 
would not have much time to prepare for interactions with 
senior USG leadership.  To facilitate dialogue and a smooth 
exchange of views, A/S Campbell invited the DPJ to continue 
contacts with the USG in both Tokyo and Washington. 
 
¶5. (C) A/S Campbell underlined that support in the United 
States for a strong Alliance is bipartisan, and that the DPJ 
must take the steps necessary to ensure that it is not 
perceived as being anti-American.  Such a perception would 
send the wrong message to China and North Korea, raise doubts 
about the bilateral relationship among our two peoples and 
would probably undermine popular support for the DPJ.  Okada 
countered that the DPJ will need a strong relationship with 
the United States to remain in power.  That said, the DPJ 
also needs to discuss issues frankly with the United States.
