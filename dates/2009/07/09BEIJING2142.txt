(U)  This message is sensitive but unclassified and

¶1. (SBU) On May 11, 2009, officials from the U.S. 
Embassy, Beijing, visited the Luzhong Prison in Zibo 
City, Shandong Province.  This visit was part of the 
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) 
investigation to resolve allegations of exports to 
the United States of porcelain products manufactured 
with prison labor. 
 
¶2. (SBU) During the visit to the Luzhong Prison 
Embassy officials met with Warden Zhang Yijia and 
other local prison officials.  Zhang provided a 
briefing on the overall operations and management of 
Luzhong Prison as well as past and current 
manufacturing at the prison. 
 
¶3. (SBU) During the meeting and visit, no evidence 
was found to substantiate the initial allegations. 
According to Zhang and other officials the prison 
conducted cement manufacturing and coal mining 
operations in the past and now produces plastic 
packaging, primarily for nearby chemical companies. 
Zhang said they do not export these products and do 
not supply chemical companies that are exporting. 
Emboffs were given a tour of a large part of Luzhong 
Prison's living and activity areas, as well as Lu 
Zhong Prison's manufacturing area where plastic bags 
were being produced. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Zhang said he is aware of the allegations 
of porcelain products made with prison labor being 
exported to the United States.  Zhang said these 
allegations may be a result of nearby porcelain 
factories, one of which is immediately adjacent to 
the prison and employs some family members of prison 
staff.  Embassy officers visited the adjacent 
Shandong Zibo Maolong Ceramics Company and spoke 
with Deputy Director Wang Li'na.  Wang said the 
company is a private enterprise and has no past or 
present ties to Luzhong Prison.  Some factory 
employees are the family members of prison staff, 
but this is only because many prison staff live 
nearby, according to Wang. (Note: The Shandong Zibo 
Maolong Ceramics Co. is one of the companies named 
in the allegations and the company's representatives 
have previously met with ICE Beijing.  End Note.) 
 
¶5. (U) ICE officials closed case number 
BJ07SR07SN0004 stemming from the allegations.
