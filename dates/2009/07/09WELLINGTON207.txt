SUBJECT: WELLINGTON RESPONSE TO GLOBAL ACTION ON FOOD SECURITY 
DEMARCHE 
 
REF: STATE 58996 
 
¶1. (U) Summary: In response to reftel, FAS Officer delivered demarche 
on 12 June to Peter Zwart at NZAID-SAEG (NZ Aid Agency).  On 4 July 
9, 2009, Mr. Zwart responded that New Zealand (GNZ) is very 
supportive of the increased international focus being given to food 
security issues and agricultural development currently and certainly 
welcoming of U.S. plans for increased attention and support to this 
area as outlined in the Five Principles for Global Action on Food 
Security.  GNZ believes food security is an issue that will continue 
to grow in importance and are concerned at the compounding impacts of 
last year's food and fuel price crises, and the current global 
economic crisis effect on poverty, hunger and malnutrition. End 
Summary. 
 
Points made by U.S. that NZ would strongly endorse 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶2. (U) The emphasis on donor coordination around country - led 
processes.   GNZ believes this is critical to long term sustainable 
progress and is where NZAID (GNZ aid agency) is putting much of its 
efforts where it is engaged in agriculture in the Pacific region. 
 
 ¶3. (U) GNZ endorse the reference to the need for a "Reformed FAO" as 
it is very concerned that current global food security challenges are 
sometimes used to distract attention from the critical need to 
dramatically improve the performance of the FAO given its critical 
role in this area. 
 
¶4. (U) GNZ would agree with the call for greater priority to be given 
to agriculture both by governments in developing countries, and by 
donors. 
 
¶5. (U) GNZ also supports the explicit mention of gender in 
agriculture in a document such as this. 
 
Areas where GNZ believes the policy could be strengthened 
--------------------------------------------- ------------- 
 
¶6. (U) Policy does not currently discuss problems associated with 
trade protection for agriculture which have long played a role in 
undermining the environment for agriculture in developing countries. 
 
 
¶7. (U) GNZ would like to see greater attention given to the role of 
social protection as part of the package of responses to food 
insecurity.  Given that the current crisis remains strongly one of 
people's purchasing power and ability to access food, rather than 
overall food availability, addressing this will require specific 
targeted attention to social protection for the most vulnerable. 
 
¶8. (U) The document is perhaps a little uncritical of the 
effectiveness of multilateral agencies in this area and while they do 
have a role to play, GNZ's experience is that they do not always 
strengthen the role of governments in leading the response. 
 
9 (U) GNZ feels the bullet point on policy issues for food insecure 
countries could be considerably expanded given that the domestic 
policy environment is also a critical dimension to the success of 
other more direct means to support agriculture. 
 
¶10. (U) While supportive of all the U.S. points listed in item 3 (see 
para. 6 of reftel), GNZ feels these are not as comprehensive as they 
could be.  New Zealand is very supportive of the UN High Level Task 
Force's Comprehensive Framework for Action (CFA).  GNZ finds this 
document to set out a broad international agenda for food security 
and agriculture which is able to be applied and adapted at regional 
and national levels.  We would like to see the CFA emphasized as much 
as possible so that it can guide a coherent and full action agenda at 
lower levels.  Is it possible for the U.S. to reference in the CFA 
Framework, perhaps emphasizing different aspects behind which the 
U.S. will particularly put its emphasis/energy. 
 
¶11. (U) GNZ wonders whether there could also be commentary around the 
global governance and architecture for food security and agriculture. 
 This is currently evolving quite rapidly and GNZ is keen to see a 
more coherent, rationale, and effective approach than has been the 
case in the past.
