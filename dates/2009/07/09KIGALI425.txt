ATTENDANCE 
 
REF: STATE 68590 
 
(SBU)  Ministry of Foreign Affairs International 
Organizations Director Ben Rutsinga told us July 8 that the 
Government of Rwanda (GOR) has yet to formulate its 
delegation for the 64th UNGA session.  Rutsinga believed it 
very likely that President Paul Kagame and Foreign Minister 
Rosemary Museminali would attend.  Rutsinga said he will 
likely accompany the two senior officials.  No interpretation 
will be necessary, as all are fluent in English.  No 
information is yet available on exact arrival or departure 
dates.
