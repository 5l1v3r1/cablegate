Title- Aggravation of the Venezuelan Crisis 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (6-28) notes: 
"....Although Chavez's rhetoric remains the same and authorities do 
not hesitate in disguising significant economic indicators .....It 
does not smooth out the gloomy Venezuelan reality nor diminish the 
difficulties in managing public current accounts.....There do not 
seem to be many doubts about the political effects of this scenario. 
On the external front, there should be some rapprochement with the 
U.S.....For Chavez, not only is it more difficult to antagonize the 
White House under President Barack Obama - who is also popular in 
Latin America - but it would also be nonsense to challenge the 
government of its main economic partner in the midst of the current 
crisis.  On the domestic front, the trend is a hardening...."
