SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Organization for the Prohibition of 
Chemical Weapons (OPCW) will not send its advance 
team to visit Baghdad July 12-16, but will postpone 
this visit until the question of the team's 
security is clearly and officially addressed.  OPCW 
Deputy Director-General Freeman, the new lead on 
Iraq issues, has been informed that a delegation 
from Baghdad will be in The Hague for the EC next 
week.  If that is the case, discussions on security 
for the OPCW's staff might prove more fruitful than 
recent communications by letter. 
 
----------------------- 
OPCW'S PROPOSED VISIT 
----------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) OPCW's Deputy Director-General (DDG), John 
Freeman (UK) requested an urgent meeting with the 
U.S. delegation to discuss U.S. security support to 
OPCW activities in Iraq.  Delreps had asked for a 
meeting July 9 with Chief of Cabinet Richard Ekwall 
(Sweden), the Organization's coordinator for Iraq 
assistance.  Freeman combined that meeting with his 
on July 10 stating that he is the new Iraq 
coordinator for the OPCW.  Delreps Beik, Robinson 
and Smith participated; Ian Richards (UK), 
Freeman's senior advisor, also attended. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Freeman clarified that the Director- 
General's (DG) June 24 letter to the U.S. (ref A 
scanned to ISN/CB) and OPCW's intent to send a team 
to Iraq was prompted by a letter from the 
Government of Iraq indicating that Iraq had 
conducted an initial site visit and that it would 
now be possible for the Technical Secretariat (TS) 
to come to Iraq.  The DG responded with a letter to 
Iraqi Ambassador Siamand Banaa that:  offered an 
initial TS visit to Baghdad (not to any of the 
declared sites), gave two options for dates, and 
reminded Banaa that Iraq had an obligation to 
guarantee the safety and security of OPCW 
personnel.  Banaa responded by selecting the July 
12-16 dates and did not comment on security. 
Freeman made a point of telling Delreps that the DG 
was very interested in making this happen and was 
looking for ways to do so, NOT excuses not to go. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Earlier this week, the DG followed up with 
Ambassador Banaa and reminded him that an answer on 
security would be required before proceeding.  As 
expected, Freeman said that it is now too late for 
the OPCW to send a team this weekend, so this 
particular visit is on hold until the security 
situation can be addressed to the DG's 
satisfaction.  Freeman also made reference to UN 
security restrictions, including the need for a 7- 
day notice prior to any movement in country, which 
he acknowledged could be longer now given recent 
MNF-I moves out of the cities. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Delreps explained to Freeman that, 
although informal coordination had been conducted 
between U.S. and Iraqi forces, the GOI had not 
officially requested U.S. support for the July 12- 
16 visit, which would need to happen before it 
could be provided.  Delrep cited the new U.S.-GOI 
Qcould be provided.  Delrep cited the new U.S.-GOI 
 
agreement in place as of January, and the need for 
all requests to be made to and come through the 
Government of Iraq, as well as the importance of a 
clear framework in which requests and security 
support can take place.  Delreps also shared with 
Freeman that e-mail messages noted that Brigadier 
General Ali most recently indicated Iraqi forces 
could handle security on their own; a possibility 
to which Freeman did not respond. 
 
¶7. (SBU) More broadly, the DDG reviewed a list of 
International Cooperation and Assistance activities 
to which Iraq had been invited (and, in some cases, 
has accepted or already participated).  He 
reiterated the point several TS officials have made 
- that they do not wish to treat Iraq differently 
than any other new State Party - and said that 
engagement with Iraq so far has been comprehensive. 
Delreps inquired about the TS supporting Iraqi 
participation in U.S./UK National Authority 
training. 
 
¶8. (SBU) Delreps told Freeman that the U.S. had 
received a fairly general request for assistance 
from Iraq, and were working with the Iraqis on 
prioritizing and specifying, with the focus likely 
to be on CW assessment and destruction.  Freeman 
agreed that we should keep in touch to avoid 
duplication of efforts, and noted that Iraq may 
also have a "capacity" problem and should be 
encouraged to prioritize its participation in 
programs and activities. 
 
¶9. (SBU) Freeman had been informed by the Iraqi 
Embassy that a delegation from Baghdad will be 
attending the Executive Council next week.  He did 
not have recent confirmation of a visiting 
delegation, but a list of names had been sent to 
the TS from the Iraqi Embassy.  (DEL COMMENT:  If, 
in fact, a delegation comes from Baghdad, it might 
be a good opportunity to clarify points of contact 
for the security requests, as well as to discuss 
other assistance requirements.  END COMMENT.) 
 
---------------- 
ACTION REQUESTED 
---------------- 
 
¶10. (SBU) Freeman requested a formal response to 
the Director General's June 24 letter to the U.S. 
about the preliminary OPCW visit to Iraq, including 
security advice and assistance. 
 
¶11. (SBU) Del would appreciate additional guidance 
for meeting the Iraqi delegation during the EC 
meeting next week to include possible U.S. 
assistance to Iraq and providing security support 
to OPCW personnel. 
 
¶12. (SBU) Please advise what arrangements/MOUs are 
in place for U.S. assistance with security for 
travel in Iraq by UN and other international 
organizations' staff, particularly in light of the 
recent withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraqi cities. 
 
¶13. (U) BEIK SENDS.
