SUBJECT: DEMARCHE DELIVERED: GOK TO REVIEW REQUEST TO 
PROVIDE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO EAST AFRICA 
 
REF: STATE 70789 
 
¶1. Following a July 9 meeting on another subject, A/DCM 
delivered points contained reftel to Salah Al-Mutairi, 
Counselor in MFA's Arab World Department, noting the urgent 
need for generous humanitarian assistance to alleviate the 
humanitarian crisis in Somalia, Ethiopia, and Kenya. 
Al-Mutairi, who had just returned from a South African 
posting, acknowledged the importance of international support 
to confront the humanitarian crisis and accompanying 
instability in the Horn of Africa, but could only offer to 
study our demarche points at this time.  Noting that his 
department covers Somalia, but not Ethiopia or Kenya, 
Al-Mutairi agreed to review our points with colleagues who 
cover those areas and provide a further response soon. 
 
¶2. Embassy will follow up with Al-Mutairi and colleagues from 
MFA's Asia and Africa Department.
