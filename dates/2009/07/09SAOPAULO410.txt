Title- Dangerous goodness 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (7-9) states: "The 
Brazilian government should look upon the proposal for the creation 
of a global food inventory to defend the poor against increasing 
prices with distrust.  The intention may appear very nice....but it 
is important to know who will pay for this bill and how the 
agriculture of the most efficient producers will be affected, 
starting with Brazil....While access to major markets remains 
limited and subsidies remain affecting price formation, the majority 
of the poor countries will encounter difficulties compete 
internationally....It is not convenient for Brazil....to discuss a 
plan for food security in poor countries without the guarantee of 
progress in Doha Round trade talks....If the Brazilian government 
does not keep alert, it will end up assuming, in name of the 
country, the guilt for all the miseries of the world." 
 
Title- The hidden face of China 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (7-9) notes: "....We 
don't know what is really going on in Xinjiang, but everything 
suggests it is serious....The [Chinese] regime is taking it so 
seriously that President Hu Jintao, who was at the G8 summit in 
Italy, suddenly had to go back [to China]." 
 
Title- Movement at the intensive care unit, where the Doha Round 
patient rests 
 
Editorial in business oriented Valor Econtmico (7-9) says: "....The 
two main economies in this crisis, U.S. and China, have adopted the 
most criticized protectionist measures [so far].....A player with 
increasing importance on the international scene, Brazil, has been 
doing great in the discussions [about Doha Round trade talks]....But 
the country is not alone and will have to get consensus in 
.....Mercosul.....whose moves point in a direction contrary to the 
one supported by President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva in 
Europe.....Brazil is completely right when it supports an effort to 
conclude the Doha Round Trade talks, but while it uses the 
microphones of a global player, Brazil must ensure that it is not 
going to demoralize itself due to the incapacity to follow its own 
prescription inside its own neighborhood."
