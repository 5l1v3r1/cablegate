BEGIN TEXT: 
 
Jakarta, July 3, 2009 
 
Honorable Speaker Nancy Pelosi 
The U.S. House of Representatives 
235 Cannon HOB 
Washington, DC 20515 
 
It is my great honor to inform you that in line with the 
dynamic situation especially matters related to political and 
social condition in Indonesia, the House of Representatives 
of the Republic of Indonesia has face more challenges in 
accommodating the people's voice and aspiration.  Prior to 
the end of the House's term of office this year, lists of 
inventory problems have been collected to be brought up to 
subsequent meetings for review. 
 
Being an institution serving to support the works of the 
House of Representatives, the Secretariat General of the 
House plays significant roles to provide administrative, 
technical and expertise to the House.  As the House faces 
more challenging works, it needs a strong and more integrated 
Secretariat General to ensure the smooth process in 
accommodating people's aspiration. 
 
Following the review of lists of inventory problems from 
previous activities, a reform to the Secretariat is deemed 
necessary.  In this relation, I have the honor to inform you 
that the House Affairs of the House of Representatives, 
dealing with internal affairs of the House, will pay a 
Working Visit to the U.S. House of Representatives from 27 
July until 2 August 2009.  This will be a study visit with 
focus on matters related to the reform of Secretariat 
General.  The delegation consists of 16 Members, 2 high 
officials from the Secretariat General, 1 staff of the 
Household Committee Secretariat, 1 researcher and 1 expert 
staff.  The name list of the delegation and other necessary 
documents will be sent in due course. 
 
To this end, I would like to seek your kind assistance to the 
possibility of the visit and hope that the proposed dates are 
suitable for the US Congress.  I would appreciate it very 
much if you could inform the relevant parties/commissions to 
meet and discuss with the Indonesian delegation. 
 
Thanking very much for your kind cooperation and attention, 
accept please the assurances of my highest consideration. 
 
JAKARTA 00001162  002 OF 002 
 
 
 
Yours Sincerely,

H.R. Agung Laksono
