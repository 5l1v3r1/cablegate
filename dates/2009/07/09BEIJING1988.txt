  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1. XINJIANG RIOT 
 
"Stability is the lifeline for development" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) (07/14): 
"Only with stability can ordinary people be happy and peaceful and 
for society develop and progress.  Under the strong leadership of 
the Central Committee and the State Council the Urumqi's social 
order has been restored.  Currently, for people of Xinjiang 
maintaining stability is their priority.  The riots that occurred 
reveal that without social stability people's lives and property can 
not be protected, not to mention social development and happiness. 
Social development goes along with economic development which 
affects the interests of all citizens.  Once there is no more 
stability social development will lose its foundation.  Stability is 
the precondition of reform or development and it is where all the 
ethnic groups' interests lie." 
 
¶2. OBAMA'S VISIT TO GHANA 
 
"Obama's 'roots-seeking trip' is unusual" 
 
The official intellectual publication Guangming Daily (Guangming 
Ribao)(07/14): "U.S. President Obama visited Ghana and has walked 
the 'irreversible way' for many black slaves.  He went seeking for 
his roots.  As the first African-American President, Obama's 
influence and affinity in Africa has exceeded all other past U.S. 
Presidents.  His comments and talks about Africa will not be taken 
as interference, but rather as 'sincere hope'. President Obama has 
stated that his hope for Africa is to promote democracy and to end 
conflicts and wars.  Obama chose to visit Ghana for its stable 
democratic and political situation.  Obama's message for Ghana is 
not much different than former President Clinton and Bush's 
messages.  However, African people are more willing to believe that 
Obama is a sincere person.  The strategy behind Obama's visit is 
important.  Africa's resources and political strategies are of 
further importance to the U.S.  Obama's trip aims at constructing a 
U.S.-Africa partnership by using U.S. values to influence African 
countries' choice of development." 
 
¶3. AUSTRALIAN SPY 
 
"Rio Tinto spy case sends China a warning" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(07/14): "The Rio Tinto spy case has shown that 
multinational companies' bribery in China has strengthened.  Cases 
like the Siemens bribery and the Avon bribery case did not receive 
proper punishment.  It has shown that China lags behind in the field 
of relevant laws.  As a country of major iron imports, China has 
always been fooled during multinational iron company negotiations. 
Uncovering Rio Tinto spy case has made it possible for people to 
realize that are "business spies".  European and American companies 
can barely endure bribery behaviors within their countries, but how 
come they act without restrictions in China?  In recent years 
readers can discover that a series of bribing scandals of 
multinational companies have been exposed.  Besides those that have 
been exposed, some companies offer bribes in China in the form of 
soft public relations.  It has come to our attention that 
implementing a Chinese-version of an 'anti-corruption law on foreign 
business companies.' is of great urgency"
