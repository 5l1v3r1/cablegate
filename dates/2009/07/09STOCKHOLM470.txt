¶1.  The Swedish Security Police (SAPO), along with two other 
agencies - the Inspectorate of Strategic Products and the Radiation 
Safety Administration - recently sent letters to seven Swedish 
universities relaying an EU Council regulation that imposed 
restrictions on Iranian and North Korean students.  Article 6 of the 
EU Council regulation 2007/140/CFSP, states that "Member States 
shall, in accordance with their national legislation, take the 
necessary measures to prevent specialized teaching or training of 
Iranian nationals, within their territories or by their nationals, 
of disciplines which would contribute to Iran's proliferation 
sensitive nuclear activities and development of nuclear weapon 
delivery systems." 
 
¶2. Swedish Radio revealed this letter on July 21, 2009, stating that 
five Swedish educational institutions have decided to comply with 
SAPO's guidance.  Each institution decides which of its program 
areas are affected by the restrictions.  About 100,000 Iranian 
dual-nationals reside in Sweden.  Public reaction to SAPO's 
guidance, although enacted last year, has been intense, resulting in 
public accusations of discrimination.  A main reason for this is the 
erroneous assumption in the Iranian diaspora that the guidance 
applies to dual nationals--it does not.  Nonetheless, Iranians make 
up a significant portion of international students enrolled in 
Swedish master programs.  About 10,000 Iranians reside in Sweden 
without Swedish citizenship.  According to SAPO there is only a 
handful of North Koreans studying in Sweden.
