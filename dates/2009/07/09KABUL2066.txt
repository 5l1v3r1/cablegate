SUBJECT: AFGHAN PARLIAMENT RECONVENES...AFTER A FASHION 
 
REF: KABUL 1405 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY: Parliament reconvened, without reaching 
quorum, on July 25.  Many MPs continue to be outside of Kabul 
campaigning for presidential candidates or themselves.  They 
will continue to meet as scheduled, but if quorum is not 
reached in the first few days they will consider a recess 
until after the August 20 presidential elections.  The 
parliament's order of business included a prayer of thanks to 
God that no MPs died or were kidnapped over the recess; so 
far, eight MPs have been killed since the parliament was 
elected in 2005.  MPs aired complaints against Coalition 
Forces and a female MP accused of obtaining land illegally. 
End Summary.

¶2.  (U) Parliament reconvened with 85 MPs in attendance (121 
are needed for quorum).  Lower House Yunus Speaker Qanooni 
told us in a private meeting on July 20 that the parliament 
will continue to meet as scheduled, but if quorum is not 
reached in the first few days, they may again consider a 
recess until after the August 20 presidential elections. 
Some speculated many Karzai-supporters were in attendance to 
show unity.  Female MP Qadria Parast (Kabul, Tajik) expressed 
surprise that 85 MPs came, and claimed parliament "would not 
be able to do anything" until after the elections, because 
without quorum they cannot make any binding legislative 
decisions.  Qanooni asked the committees to meet July 26 to 
discuss the upcoming legislative agenda.  The parliament gave 
thanks to God that no MPs died or were kidnapped over the 
recess; so far, eight have been killed since the 2005 
elections.

COMPLAINTS AGAINST COALITION FORCES 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶3.  (U) MP Sayed Gailani (Paktika, Pashtun) said Coalition 
Forces were listening to "false informers" in Paktika as they 
tried to locate the kidnapped U.S. soldier there.  MP Abdul 
Khan (Nangarhar, Pashtun) said Coalition Forces launched an 
attack in the Shirqad district of Nangarhar province, killing 
four civilians.  He claimed they were "attacking the houses 
of innocent people."  Speaker Qanooni said the false 
informers needed to be brought to justice, and called for the 
MPs in question to write a letter explaining the details of 
these cases to the Coalition Forces.  He said it was not 
enough to "just talk about it." 
 
--------------------------------- 
FEMALE MP ACCUSED OF ABUSE OF POWER 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (U) Four male MPs accused female MP Parween Durani 
(Kuchi, Pashtun) of abusing her MP position to illegally 
obtain land and other benefits; Parween was not in 
attendance.  The accusers included fellow-Kuchi 
representative and other Pashtuns.  In a rare show of female 
solidarity - in particular from another ethnic group - MP 
Fatima Aziz (Kunduz, Tajik) defended Parween, saying these 
were only allegations, and that she was being accused because 
she was a female.  This led to some vociferous debate, to 
include more MPs calling for disciplinary action against 
Parween.  Speaker Qanooni sent the matter to the Committee on 
the Protection of MPs for further investigation.
