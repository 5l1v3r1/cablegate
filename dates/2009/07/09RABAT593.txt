RESOLUTION 1822 
 
REF: SECSTATE 69814 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary.  Morocco supports the USG position on the 
review of the UN 1267 Consolidated List, Driss Ben Fares, 
Plenipotentiary Minister at the Bureau of Legal Affairs and 
Treaties at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told EconOff on 
July 13 after receiving reftel demarche.  Providing copies of 
background and individual/entity information from reftel, 
EconOff highlighted the case of Moroccan national Mohamed 
Moumou, likely to be proposed for de-listing since his death. 
 Ben Fares responded that the listed individuals are "no 
longer in Morocco," and added that the GOM would support the 
de-listing of Moumou.  If the Ministry of Finance uncovers 
any relevant information on the identified individuals, Ben 
Fares promised, the GOM will pass that to the USG.  However, 
he predicted, the GOM is unlikely to generate additional 
information. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The most "unfortunate" obstacle in combating 
terrorism finance, MFA's Ben Fares commented to EconOff, is 
the lack of regional and internal communication.  He praised 
the North Africa Economic Sanctions Workshop organized by the 
U.S.  Treasury in Rabat last January, suggesting that 
"similar seminars are always useful because they allow 
regional experts to interact directly and the USG to evaluate 
its progress in this realm."  Despite the obstacles, Ben 
Fares concluded, combating terrorism finance is a "daily 
venture" for Morocco, and its efforts will continue.
