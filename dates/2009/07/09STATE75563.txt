SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON APPLICATION 050177626 
 
REF: A. 2006 BLUE LANTERN GUIDEBOOK 
     ¶B. 2009 MADRID 453 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request.  See paragraphs 2-4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Embassy's assistance in 
conducting a pre-license check on application 050177626 for 
the export of night vision goggles (NVGs) to Spain.  Post is 
requested to complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days. 
 Lack of response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending 
and future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for request:  sensitive commodity and potential for 
diversion and misuse. Also, foreign intermediate consignee, 
Elint S.A. has been implicated in the potential diversion of 
NVGs in the past. 
 
¶4. Background:  DTCC requested a Blue Lantern post-shipment 
check on night vision devices (NVDs) (authorization request 
No. 05-971940) for the Spanish Marines.   Embassy Madrid, 
supporting DDTC's Blue lantern inquiry, determined that 
Spanish intermediate consignee, Elint S.A. could not account 
for 112 NVDs, had retransferred dozens of NVDs to 
unauthorized end-users in Spain and within NATO, had stored 
at least 114 NVDs in its own facilities without 
authorization, and committed several other violations and 
irregularities.  Based on Post's findings, the Spanish MoD 
asked the Spanish National Police to investigate, and U.S. 
applicant ITT is pursuing a patent infringement suit against 
Elint S.A. 
 
¶5. ACTION MADRID:  Post is requested to make inquiries with 
appropriate officials to determine if the Spanish Marines 
ordered the NVGs from Elint S.A. and if so, verify the amount 
and dollar value, and that the items will be used for the 
purpose stated on the license. 
 
The following questions are provided as suggested guidance: 
 
--Can the Spanish MoD confirm the existence of a contract or 
purchase order with Elint S.A. for the full quantity and 
dollar value of NVGs? 
 
--Can the Spanish MoD confirm end-use of the NVGs (ostensibly 
in Afghanistan and Lebanon)?  How many NVGs are required for 
Afghanistan and Lebanon respectively? 
END ACTION
