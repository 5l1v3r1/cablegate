SUBJECT: JULY 9 MFA PRESS BRIEFING: XINJIANG UNREST, RIO TINTO 
ESPIONAGE CASE, CHINESE BUSINESSMEN ARRESTED IN RUSSIA 
 
¶1. Key points at the July 9 MFA press briefing: 
 
-- Regarding the events in Xinjiang, while current casualty 
figures were not available, no foreign casualties had been 
recorded. 
 
-- Regarding Turkey's proposal to discuss the events in 
Xinjiang before the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), 
the spokesperson noted that as this was an internal Chinese 
matter, there was no reason to seek UNSC discussion. 
 
-- Regarding the recent arrest in Shanghai of four employees 
of Australian mining company Rio Tinto, the spokesperson noted 
that there was sufficient evidence that the accused - 
including Stern Hu, an Australian citizen - had stolen state 
secrets, gravely harming China's economic interests and 
national security. 
 
-- The spokesperson downplayed speculation that the arrests 
were payback for the recent failed deal between Chinalco and 
Rio Tinto, emphasizing that this was an independent judicial 
matter and that politicizing the issue served no purpose and 
would be bad for Australia. 
 
 
Xinjiang Unrest: Casualties, Turkey's Proposal 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2. Regarding the violence in Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, 
MFA Spokesperson Qin Gang noted at the July 9 regular MFA 
press briefing that no current figures were available for the 
number of total deaths, though he added that there had been no 
foreign casualties thus far.  Regarding Turkey's proposal to 
discuss the events in Xinjiang before the United Nations 
Security Council (UNSC), the spokesperson noted that as this 
was an internal Chinese matter, there was no reason to seek 
UNSC discussion.  The spokesperson added that the unrest in 
Xinjiang was driven by organized, violent forces and asked 
that the international community respect China's territorial 
sovereignty and national security and cooperate with China to 
counter the evil forces of extremism, separatism and terrorism 
rather than enforce double standards. 
 
Xinjiang Unrest: No Comment on Kadeer and Tohti 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶3. The spokesperson was asked about comments he had made at 
the 7 July regular MFA press briefing, in which he claimed 
Chinese authorities possessed evidence that Rebiya Kadeer was 
responsible for the unrest in Xinjiang, urging the 
international community not to support her separatist 
activities.  When asked if China would seek to work with the 
United States (where Kadeer resided) to pursue extradition or 
other legal action against Kadeer, the spokesperson offered no 
comment.  The spokesperson also provided no comment when asked 
about the reported recent arrest of Ilham Tohti, an ethnic- 
Uighur professor at the Central University for Nationalities 
in Beijing. 
 
Rio Tinto Espionage Case: Confirmation 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. Regarding the recent arrest in Shanghai of four employees 
of Australian mining company Rio Tinto, the spokesperson noted 
that there was sufficient evidence that the accused - 
including Stern Hu, an Australian citizen - had stolen state 
secrets, gravely harming China's economic interests and 
national security.  In response to questions of whether these 
arrests were payback for the recent failed deal between 
Chinalco and Rio Tinto, the spokesperson emphasized that this 
was an independent judicial matter and that politicizing the 
issue served no purpose and would be bad for Australia. 
 
 
Rio Tinto Espionage Case: No Further Comment 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. The spokesperson did not respond to questions regarding 
when Hu would be granted access to Australian diplomats or to 
a lawyer.   (Note: subsequent press reporting from 9 July 
indicated that Australian consular officials would be allowed 
to visit Hu the following day.)  When asked whether the 
reported recent arrest of a Shougang steel company executive 
on charges of commercial espionage was related to the Rio 
arrests, the spokesperson offered no comment.

Chinese Businessmen Detained in Russia 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶6. In response to a question about Chinese businessmen 
arrested in Russia, the spokesperson noted that China had not 
yet received official notification of the arrests from Russia, 
but that China would work to ensure the businessmen's 
interests were represented.  The spokesperson added a reminder 
to all Chinese abroad to respect local laws.
