SUBJECT: Indonesian Environment Minister Highlights Peat Emissions, 
Environmental Law Enforcement 
 
¶1.  (U) During a December 4 meeting, Indonesia's new Environment 
Minister Gusti Muhammad Hatta highlighted monitoring and mitigation 
of peat land emissions as a key area for partnership and U.S. 
assistance.  Government of Indonesia (GOI) ministries are busy 
preparing plans to achieve President Yudhoyono's 2020 emissions 
reduction target of 26%, Hatta said.  He noted that of the 26%, the 
GOI is targeting 14% from Land Use Change and Forestry (LUCF), 6% 
from energy, and 6% from waste management. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Minister Hatta asked about potential Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) assistance for implementing Indonesia's new 
Environmental Management Law.  This has significantly strengthened 
the Environment Ministry's enforcement authority, he said.  The EPA 
could help his Ministry set up regional EPA-like bodies throughout 
Indonesia and improve its capacity to exercise this expanded 
enforcement role. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Hatta welcomed the possibility of discussing this with EPA 
Administrator Lisa Jackson during COP-15.  However, Hatta noted that 
he is likely to arrive in Copenhagen on December 13 at the earliest 
and possibly as late as December 16 (as part of President 
Yudhoyono's entourage). 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Copenhagen Logistics: Post will follow up on Minister 
Hatta's travel schedule.  Bilateral meetings can also be arranged 
through Dr. Henry Bastaman, who will accompany the Minister.  Email:
