¶1.  (SBU) Newly appointed Sverdlovsk oblast governor Aleksandr 
Misharin (see reftel) hosted a holiday toast for the Urals-based 
diplomatic corps at the governor's residence on December 10. 
For most of the foreign diplomats present, this was the first 
face to face meeting with the new governor.  The number of 
consulates, trade representative offices, and honorary 
consulates located in Yekaterinburg now exceeds 20.  Noting that 
the majority of diplomatic missions must rent premises in 
Yekaterinburg, the governor offered to provide land to missions 
willing to invest in building their own buildings as the Chinese 
are reportedly planning. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Misharin's presentation and subsequent interaction 
with the assembled diplomats revealed his overriding focus on 
revitalizing the region's economy and his interest in 
stimulating foreign investment.  Misharin noted that the 
region's foreign trade turnover in 2009 stood at about US$ 7 
billion, a 40% decline from 2008.  Though the governor failed to 
mention that the U.S. is the region's leading trade partner 
according to the oblast ministry of Foreign and External 
Economic Relations, he did note that France was the only country 
with which trade increased during the year.  After expressing 
his appreciation for the cultural and educational contributions 
of Yekaterinburg's diplomatic missions, the governor invited 
more international trade delegations and business exhibitions in 
the future, noting that construction of a new 
convention/exhibition center would begin this year.  Misharin 
reiterated his goal of modernizing the regional economy along 
the lines of President Medvedev's November address.  To this 
end, infrastructure projects, including a proposed high-speed 
rail link between Yekaterinburg and Moscow, will get special 
attention.  Again, he mentioned the Chinese as potential 
investors in this project. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) When his turn came to propose a toast, the CG recalled 
the fifteen year history of the Consulate General in 
Yekaterinburg and highlighted the Boeing Corporation's $30 
million investment in its joint venture with Russian titanium 
giant VSMPO-Avismo in northern Sverdlovsk oblast as an example 
of significant long-term business cooperation.  In his response, 
the governor proposed the establishment of a direct air 
connection between Yekaterinburg and the United States. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Though less spontaneous and gregarious than his 
predecessor Eduard Rossel, the new governor appeared 
well-briefed and was at ease interacting with the diplomatic 
corps.  New cabinet appointments are expected by the end of the 
year.
