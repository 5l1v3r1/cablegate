¶1. PolOff delivered reftel demarche informing China of the 
proposed amendments to the Global Initiative to Combat 
Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) Terms of Reference to MFA Arms 
Control and Disarmament Department Nuclear Division Officer 
Xu Feng on December 28.  Xu thanked PolOff for the draft 
Terms of Reference and said he would consult within the 
Chinese government "to see what we could contribute to the 
draft."  Xu said that his understanding of the GICNT was that 
it was a forum for partners to exchange information on how to 
combat nuclear terrorism.  In its current format, the GICNT 
was not "institutionalized" nor did there exist a permanent 
agency to conduct its work.  With some of the proposed 
changes in the Terms of Reference, Xu asked whether the 
United States and Russia were looking to move the GICNT into 
a more "structured mechanism." 
 
¶2. PolOff emphasized that the January 19, 2010 Exercise 
Planning Group (EPG) meeting would provide an opportunity for 
GICNT partners to discuss the proposed amendments before the 
June 2010 Plenary.  Xu said that his office was considering a 
positive decision with regard to China's participation in the 
EPG and would "actively participate" in the discussions.  Xu 
also asked PolOff whether Washington could provide more 
information about the proposed location for the June 2010 
Plenary.  PolOff agreed to convey Beijing's questions to 
Washington.
