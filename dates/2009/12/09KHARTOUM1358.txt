SUBJECT: Five Rwandan UNAMID Peacekeepers Killed in Two Separate 
Attacks in North Darfur 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Five Rwandan peacekeepers with the United 
Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) were killed over 
the weekend in two separate attacks in North Darfur.  Gunmen opened 
fire on a UNAMID convoy traveling near Saraf Omra on December 4, 
killing three peacekeepers.  On December 5, gunmen fired on three 
peacekeepers assisting with water distribution near the UNAMID team 
site in Shagil Tobaya, killing two.  GOS authorities announced 
arrests in the Saraf Omra killings, but did not release any 
additional details.  UNAMID noted that in both cases, peacekeepers 
returned fire but acted to minimize civilian casualties.  End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) On Friday, December 4, unidentified gunmen opened fire on 
Rwandan peacekeepers escorting a water tanker in Saraf Omra, North 
Darfur, approximately 240 km northwest of El Fasher.  Two 
peacekeepers were killed immediately, three were seriously wounded, 
and one of the wounded died prior to being evacuated to El Fasher. 
The ambush took place 300 meters from a Government of Sudan (GOS) 
police checkpoint, in the presence of numerous civilians.  The 
perpetrators escaped immediately following the attacks.  UN sources 
reported that some gunmen were dressed as civilians, and others wore 
olive drab fatigues of a type common throughout Darfur but denoting 
no specific identification.  On December 6, GOS-controlled press 
reported that the Governor of North Darfur, Wali Osman Kibir, 
announced the arrest of the attackers, but neither UNAMID nor 
independent sources were able to immediately confirm this 
information, and the GOS did not offer any additional details. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On Saturday, December 5, unidentified armed gunmen staged 
another attack on Rwandan peacekeepers in North Darfur.  Two 
peacekeepers were killed at 4:40 p.m. in an attack close to the 
UNAMID team site in Shagil Tobaya, a town approximately 50 km south 
of El Fasher.  According to UN sources, three peacekeepers were on 
water distribution detail, and were assisting a crowd of civilians 
at a water collection point located 500 meters from the entrance to 
the team site.  (Note: Shagil Tobaya has seen tribal clashes in the 
last month, and a growing number of internally displaced persons 
(IDPs) have sought security by squatting on the land surrounding the 
team site.  End note.)  Armed gunmen standing within the crowd of 
civilians raised their weapons and fired, killing two peacekeepers 
immediately and seriously wounding a third.  The attackers stole a 
UNAMID vehicle, but quickly abandoned it after being pursued by a 
response team from the UNAMID team site.  The attackers escaped, and 
GOS authorities had not announced any arrests as of the afternoon of 
December 6. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Acting UNAMID Chief of Staff Kemal Saiki noted that in both 
cases, peacekeepers returned fire, but acted with restraint due to 
the civilians present in both locations.  In both cases, the Rwandan 
peacekeeping companies involved operate in areas where Arab militias 
have repeatedly clashed with local tribes, in territory over which 
the GOS has very limited control.  In addition to the twenty-two 
peacekeepers killed since the start of UNAMID's operations in 2008, 
two UNAMID civilian staff remain held after being kidnapped in West 
Darfur in September. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment: The presence of UNAMID peacekeepers remains a 
politically explosive issue in many localities throughout Darfur. 
By upsetting the delicate balance between GOS security forces, local 
militia and civilians, peacekeepers become another unconcealed 
target in a region with no shortage of armed actors and political 
grievances.  It is unlikely that any information will emerge to 
connect the two attacks, but the number of coincidences, as one UN 
official put it, is "unusual."  Detractors may be eager to point the 
finger at Khartoum, but at this time, the most that can be noted is 
that the GOS has done little to hold to account those who have 
killed or kidnapped UNAMID peacekeepers and civilian staff.  For a 
government with judges, prosecutors and security forces in all three 
states of Darfur, the GOS has not taken sufficient measures to 
discourage the environment of impunity that exists.  End comment.
