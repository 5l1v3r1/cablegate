SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (12/29): 
U.S. Letters of Guarantees and Condemnation of New Settlement Units 
in East Jerusalem Dominate Local Press 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
-------------Independent daily Al-Quds leads with news about U.S. 
Special Envoy to the Middle East Mitchell's upcoming visit to the 
region.  According to the article, Mitchell will present "two 
letters of guarantees to the PA and Israel" that could serve as the 
framework to re-launch peace talks. 
 
PA Official daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front pages news that the PA 
denied having any information about the U.S. letters of guarantees. 
PLO Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat reiterated that if the US wants to 
see resumption of negotiations, it has to force Israel to stop all 
settlement activities. Erekat is quoted in independent daily 
Al-Ayyam stating, "we need actions not statements or guarantees." 
 
Al-Quds runs separate front page coverage of statements made by 
Yossi Beilin, former Knesset member, that Israeli Prime Minister 
Netanyahu is about to reach an agreement with the U.S. 
administration regarding a two-year framework for resuming 
negotiations with the Palestinians.  Dailies report that Netanyahu 
is in Egypt today to discuss with President Mubarak possibilities of 
resuming negotiations with the Palestinians.  Al-Quds quotes 
Netanyahu saying that the time is now appropriate for achieving 
peace. 
 
Independent daily Al-Ayyam leads with the PA ministerial cabinet's 
condemnation of the Israeli issuance of tenders for nearly 700 new 
settlement units in Jerusalem.  The PA reiterated that the new 
construction projects jeopardize the two-state solution. 
 
Dailies quote PA presidency spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeinah stating 
that "any new Israeli tenders on occupied Palestinian land are 
illegal" and that how the United States will respond to the new 
tenders will test the credibility of the U.S. administration and the 
seriousness of the GOI to achieving peace. 
 
Dailies and independent news outlet Ma'an quote White House 
Secretary  Robert Gibbs' statement yesterday, that "the White House 
opposes new Israeli construction in East Jerusalem...the status of 
Jerusalem is a permanent status issue that must be resolved by the 
parties through negotiations and supported by the international 
community." 
 
Dailies report that the PA ministerial committee assigned to pursue 
the establishment of the Palestinian International Airport presented 
its recommendations to the ministerial cabinet yesterday regarding 
the best location for the airport.  According to coverage, the 
committee recommended locating the airport between Jericho and 
Jerusalem. 
 
Al-Quds reports that settlers of Yitzhar settlement near Nablus 
stoned a Palestinian bus yesterday causing the bus overturn.  Five 
Palestinian passengers were hurt.

BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------Asad Abdel Rahman writing in Al-Quds under the title 
"The State of Settlers and Netanyahu...What To Do" opines that 
Netanyahu was never serious about the ten-month moratorium as can be 
seen by the daily approval of new construction tenders and new

units.  Abdel Rahman comments that it is becoming more and more 
obvious that Israeli is not serious about engaging in a real peace 
ce 
negotiations.
