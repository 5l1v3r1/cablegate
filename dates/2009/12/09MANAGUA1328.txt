REF: MANAGUA 354; 04 MANAGUA 1057 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: Post requests that the Department remove General 
Oscar Balladares from the Section 2225 visa ineligibility file. 
Post has confirmed that Balladares resolved his property claim 
dispute with U.S. claimants Ricardo, Salvador, and Eduardo Cuadra 
when the Government of Nicaragua settled the case on March 5. 
Please see action request in Paragraph 3. 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) On March 5, the Government of Nicaragua settled the 
property claim of U.S. citizens Ricardo, Salvador, and Eduardo 
Cuadra (Ref A).  The Cuadra family received indemnification bonds 
(BPIs) with a face value of $56,758 as compensation for one 
property expropriated by the Nicaraguan Army (Ref B).  On December 
10, Econoff spoke to Mr. Ricardo Cuadra who confirmed that his 
family settled the claim and they had received the BPIs.  Mr. 
Cuadra lives in Managua and may be contacted at (505)8926-2534. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Action Request: Post finds sufficient evidence that the 
property dispute between the Cuadra family and Oscar Balladares has 
been resolved.  Thus, we request the Department consider removing 
his name from the Section 2225 file.  [Note: Balladares currently 
has no Section 2225-related hits in the CLASS visa lookout 
database.  End Note.]
