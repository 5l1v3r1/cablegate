Poland 
 
The Polish Ministry of Internal Affairs and Administration 
assesses the terrorist threat level in Poland as low. 
However, the government devotes significant resources to 
counterterrorism activities to ensure the threat does not 
rise. During the reporting period, the Interior Ministry 
noted increasing concern about right-wing extremists in 
Poland. There have been no terrorist attacks in Poland in 
recent history. 
 
Poland continued to support international counterterrorism 
efforts through its participation in the International 
Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. At the end 
of 2009, Polish ISAF troops represented the seventh-largest 
national contingent; 16 have been killed in action. Poland 
has pledged to increase its contribution to ISAF to 2,600 
troops in 2010. Poland deployed about 17 soldiers as part of 
the NATO Training Mission in Iraq. 
 
Through participation in initiatives including the 
Proliferation Security Initiative and the Global Initiative 
to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, Poland remained an active 
participant in various international undertakings to combat 
terrorist threats. Two years after integration into the 
Schengen zone, Poland maintained a close and growing 
collaboration with its European neighbors on 
counterterrorism. Poland pursued a proactive and inclusive 
approach to counterterrorism cooperation with Ukraine in 
advance of the EURO 2012 Soccer Championship, to be jointly 
hosted by Poland and Ukraine. 
 
The bilateral Counterterrorism Working Group (CTWG), formed 
in 2004 to further U.S.-Polish collaboration on 
counterterrorism by synchronizing counterterrorism policy and 
training counterterrorism specialists, continued to hold 
regular meetings. The CTWG identified specific areas of 
mutual interest, including critical infrastructure and 
terrorist financing, and developed further plans for training 
and cooperation. The Polish and U.S. militaries reached 
consensus on a Bilateral Agreement on cooperation in 
combating cyberterrorism. In 2008, the Illinois State 
Partnership Program initiated a five-year program to expand 
cooperation between the Illinois National Guard and various 
Polish ministries on consequence management.
