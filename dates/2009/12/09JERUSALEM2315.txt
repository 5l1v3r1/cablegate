SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (12/24): Stories on "Christmas 
under occupation" run throughout the Palestinian media 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
 
The three dailies lead with reports that a Hamas delegate is heading 
to Syria to consult with Hamas leaders there on the group's response 
to the Israeli offer regarding the prisoner exchange deal. Al-Hayat 
Al-Jadida front pages news reporting that the return of the German 
mediator is dependent on Hamas' response. The report also notes that 
the Israeli proposal to expel more than 100 prisoners might "impede" 
the deal. Al-Quds reports that the "expulsion proposal" will be 
presented to the prisoners to decide for themselves. Al-Ayyam 
carries a report from DPA saying that unprecedented security 
measures are in place at the Rafah crossing in preparation for an 
exchange deal. 
 
The three dailies run stories on the Chief Mufti and the PA 
Ministers of Tourism and Awqaf condemning Israel's widespread 
excavations under the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, including stealing 
stones and monuments from the Ummayad palaces near the mosque. 
Al-Ayyam and Al-Quds report that Israeli authorities will continue 
their excavations for the third consecutive day. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Ayyam run stories on the separation 
barrier's negative impact on Christmas in Bethlehem. Al-Ayyam notes 
that when the wall is complete, Bethlehem will be separated from 
Jerusalem for the first time in "2000 years of Christianity." In 
related news, Al-Quds' lead photo highlights the visit of "Santa 
Claus" to the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood to distribute gifts to 
children evacuated from their homes by settlers. 
 
The three dailies quote Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam 
Fayyad saying that "the [Palestinian internal] division has been 
prolonged and should be ended" during a march on the International 
Day of the Disabled in Ramallah organized by the Red Crescent. 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida highlights a photo of PM Fayyad signing an 
agreement worth 50 million Euros with the EU. 
 
------------ 
BLOCK QUOTE: 
------------ 
 
Al-Ayyam runs an editorial by Talal Owkal under the title "It's 
Important that Israel Bow" saying, "In all cases, Palestinians 
should stick to their demands [on the prisoner exchange deal] even 
if that means more endurance is needed. That's because Israel will 
'bow' at the end, and it's important that it 'bows' for once in 
front of the Palestinians." 
 
-------------------- 
Palestine Cyberspace: 
--------------------- 
 
This week, Palestinian cyberspace focused on the prisoner exchange 
deal and stories, anecdotes, and photos of "Christmas under 
occupation." Many Palestinian social media sites circulated a report 
on Al-Jazeera English titled "Christmas 'under siege' in Bethlehem."
