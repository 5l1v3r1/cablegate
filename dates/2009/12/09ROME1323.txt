SUBJECT: GOI UNOFFICIALLY AGREES TO IMMEDIATE BUDGET 
SUPPORT FOR PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY 
 
REF: STATE 120487 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary. The GOI has unofficially agreed to convert 
10 million euros of its unobligated Paris pledge into 
immediate budget support for the Palestinian Authority. End 
summary. 
 
¶2. (U) On 1 December ECONOFF conveyed Secretary Clinton's 
request for immediate budget support for the Palestinian 
Authority (reftel) to Counselor Antonello De Riu of the 
Directorate General for Development Cooperation (DGCS) of the 
Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs along with the USG 
suggestion that Italy convert unobligated funds from their 
Paris pledge into immediate support. 
 
¶3. (SBU) De Riu informed ECONOFF that the DGCS and the 
Directorate General for the Mediterranean and Middle East 
(DGMM) will present their joint recommendation today to the 
Foreign Minister that Italy immediately allocate 10 million 
euros towards budget support for the Palestinian Authority. 
He stressed that this information was "unofficial" until 
their recommendation is officially approved. He added that 
they had already begun making this decision upon receipt of 
Prime Minister Stoere's request. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Counselor De Riu mentioned that this decision was 
made easier "in these difficult financial times" when funding 
for a planned NGO project became available after the 
Palestinian Authority refused to allow the project to go 
forward. The project was a cooperative venture between 
Palestinian and Israeli NGOs aimed at placing Palestinian 
children in Israeli hospitals.
