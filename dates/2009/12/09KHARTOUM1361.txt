¶1. (U) U.S. Embassy Khartoum nominates Lubna Hussein for the 2010 
Secretary's Award for International Women of Courage. 
 
¶2. (U) The Public Order Police of the Government of Sudan (GOS) 
arrested Hussein in July, charging her with violating the Sudanese 
law for "public appearance in indecent dress."  At the time of her 
arrest, Hussein was attending a social event at a restaurant in 
Khartoum and was wearing loose-fitting long pants, a multi-layered 
long-sleeved dress blouse, and a silk headscarf.  Hussein refused to 
accept the circumscribed punishment of either payment of a fine or 
forty lashes, and instead challenged Sudanese authorities to a full 
public trial.  After numerous trial delays and public hearings, 
Hussein served one day in jail but was freed when her fine for 500 
Sudanese pounds (approximately USD 220) was paid on her behalf and 
against her wishes by the pro-government Sudanese Journalists Union. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Hussein attracted worldwide media attention for her adamant 
stand in favor of women's rights, which began with her arrest and 
has continued following her travels throughout the Middle East and 
Europe.  She has consistently stated that her goal is to overturn 
Sudan's archaic Public Order Laws, which the GOS enacted in the 
1980s to link Sudanese law more closely to Sharia law.  Hussein 
hopes that her efforts will prevent women from being lashed in the 
future for subjective interpretations of ambiguous legal language 
and for violating arbitrary enforcement of the Public Order Laws. 
Sudanese civil society rallied to support her cause, and Hussein's 
case took GOS authorities by surprise.  Prior to the conclusion of 
her trial, Hussein acknowledged receiving numerous anonymous 
threats, including death and rape threats. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Hussein is currently traveling in Europe.  Post has not yet 
informed Lubna Hussein of this nomination.  This nomination has been 
seconded by the Office of U.S. Special Envoy to Sudan General Scott 
Gration. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Post's Point of Contact for this nomination is 
Political Officer Bonnie Long (longbd@state.gov).
