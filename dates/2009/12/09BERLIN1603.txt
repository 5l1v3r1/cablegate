¶1. (U) SUMMARY: From December 5-December 11, the number of 
confirmed H1N1 infections in Germany rose by 6,800 to a total 
of 203,713 cases. The number of H1N1 deaths in Germany 
increased to 119.  END SUMMARY 
 
 
¶2. (U) The Influenza Working Group of the Robert Koch 
Institute (RKI) reported on December 16 a total of 6,800 new 
laboratory H1N1 cases in Germany from December 5 to December 
11, increasing the total number of H1N1 cases to 203,713. The 
rate of new infections continues to decline.  Bavaria remains 
the German state with the highest number of confirmed H1N1 
cases, with a total of 41,068 - accounting for 20 percent of 
all virus infections in Germany - followed by Nord Rhine- 
Westphalia (37,278) and Baden-Wuerttemberg (30,756). 
 
¶3. (U) As of December 16, RKI confirmed the deaths of a total 
of 119  patients due to H1N1.  In 83 percent of the deaths, 
patients were younger than 60 years of age.  In the majority 
of cases, the patients had underlying health conditions and 
were considered to be "risk patients." 
 
¶4. (U)  According to information from the Paul-Ehrlich- 
Institute, 25 patients died between October 26 and December 3, 
shortly after receiving the H1N1 vaccine Pandemrix.  In 12 of 
the cases, an autopsy showed that underlying health 
conditions, not the vaccine, caused the death. In seven of the 
cases, the patients had underlying health conditions.  Cause 
of death for the remaining 6 cases has not yet been announced.
