¶1.  (C) SUMMARY:  On December 19 at 9:15 p.m., the Royal 
Government of Cambodia (RGC) deported 20 Uighur 
asylum-seekers back to China.  Police removed the Uighurs 
from their safe house on December 18 around 6:00 p.m., and 
held them in a detention facility inside the Ministry of 
Interior compound for 26 hours before placing the group on a 
chartered jet that arrived from China.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------ 
Uigher Arrivals and Assistance 
------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (C) The first known Uighur asylum-seeker arrived in Phnom 
Penh on May 31; the remaining 21 arrived in October and 
November.  The Embassy first learned of the influx of Uighurs 
to Cambodia on November 17, from a walk-in contact.  All 22 
sought assistance from JRS, which helped them file for asylum 
with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) 
office in Phnom Penh.  Up through December 16, JRS housed the 
Uighurs in four locations.  A four-person family (husband, 
wife, 2-year-old child, 6-month-old infant) stayed inside the 
JRS compound while the remaining Uighurs, all men, were 
spread between three rental houses.  However, the 18 living 
outside the JRS compound were congregating at the largest of 
the three rental properties and sleeping there together. JRS 
provided money for food and other necessities, but the group 
was doing its own shopping until early December.  (NOTE: 
UNHCR provides no assistance to asylum-seekers who are 
awaiting refugee status determination.  Asylum-seekers are 
expected to find their own lodging, food, and other support. 
UNHCR typically notes the availability of Jesuit Refugee 
Services (JRS) for assistance if needed.  JRS is the only NGO 
in Cambodia providing regular legal and humanitarian 
assistance to asylum-seekers.  END NOTE.) 
 
¶3.  (C)  On December 4, the Uighurs' presence in Cambodia 
became widely known with the publication of information about 
them in several newspapers, on the radio and Internet.  The 
Embassy urged UNHCR to reconsider providing protection to the 
group, and UNHCR Regional Director Raymond Hall said the 
agency began considering options for assisting the RGC in 
providing increased security to the group. 
 
¶5.  (C) Based on a discussion December 14 between UNHCR 
Deputy Regional Representative Giuseppe de Vincentis and 
Deputy Prime Minister Sar Kheng, UNHCR and the RGC made joint 
plans to relocate the Uighurs to a more secure location (Ref 
D).  Mid-day on December 16, UNHCR vehicles transported the 
Uighurs to Montagnard Site 3, a restricted site managed by a 
UNHCR implementing partner, and which houses approximately 90 
Montagnard asylum-seekers and refugees awaiting resettlement. 
 (NOTE:  Cambodian police did not transport the group, as 
stated in an RGC diplomatic note.  END NOTE.)  Cambodian 
National Police officers provided security for the Montagnard 
site.  The Uighurs spent the night of December 16 at Site 3 
(Ref C). 
 
¶6.  (C) During the move, UNHCR and JRS discovered that 2 
Uighurs were no longer present.  Sister Denise Coghlan told 
Pol Chief that the two were believed to have run away on 
their own (Ref C).  According to JRS, the two left the large 
rental house around 3:00 p.m. on December 15, telling their 
companions that they were returning to one of the other 
rental houses in order to do laundry; they took their 
wallets, including some money, and their "person of concern" 
letters when they departed the house.  The remaining Uighurs 
told JRS they believed the two had decided to spend the night 
at one of the other houses.  Consequently, when JRS checked 
in with the group by cell phone the night of December 15, the 
16 at the house did not alert JRS that the two had not 
returned.  UNHCR noticed the absence when they conducted a 
roll-call December 16 at Site 3 following the move.  The 
group then explained the circumstances to UNHCR and JRS. 
 
¶7.  (C) On the afternoon of December 17, UNHCR relocated the 
Uighur group a second time, to a limited-access safe house 
rented by UNHCR, which was to be jointly managed by UNHCR and 
the RGC.  JRS reported that they had full access to the safe 
house and the Uighurs.  The JRS legal advocate made an 
unannounced visit to the house the afternoon of December 18, 
and was allowed access without problems.  The JRS advocate 
last saw the group at approximately 4:30 p.m. on December 18, 
when she departed the safe house.

RGC About Face 
-------------- 
 
¶8.  (SBU) The RGC maintained a consistent response through 
December 17, claiming that it would abide by its obligations 
under the UN Refugee Convention.  Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
spokesman Koy Kuoung noted December 17 that the RGC was 
"cooperating with UNHCR to conduct interviews to determine 
whether the Uighurs are eligible for refugee status." 
 
¶9.  (C) On December 18, the Embassy learned from UNHCR that 
the RGC had signed the long-awaited Sub-Decree implementing 
Cambodia's obligations under the UN Refugee Convention (Ref 
A).  The Sub-Decree had been under review for months, and was 
not expected to be put into effect until early 2010.  The 
Sub-Decree assigned full power for making RSD decisions to 
the Minister of Interior, which was in keeping with UNHCR's 
expectation.  However, immediately after the Sub-Decree was 
signed, Acting Minister of the Interior Em Sam An signed an 
order authorizing the deportation of the Uighurs within 7 
days under the Immigration Law. 
 
¶10.  (SBU) The RGC tone in public statements also changed 
abruptly late on December 18, when Interior Ministry 
spokesman Khieu Sopheak suddenly declared that the group 
"were not real refugees" but rather "criminals escaping from 
China and involved with a terrorist organization."  The 
comment and tone was nearly identical to statements made by a 
spokesperson from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 
December 15 and repeated on December 17.

Detention

¶11.  (C) At 7:00 p.m. on December 18, when a source at the 
RGC Refugee Office told UNHCR that the Uighurs would be 
deported.  The initial report that the group had been placed 
on an outbound commercial flight to China at 6:00 p.m. proved 
false.  Further investigation revealed the Uighurs were still 
in Cambodia and detained at a municipal detention facility 
inside the Ministry of Interior (MOI) compound.  To monitor 
the potential refoulement of the group, the U.S. Embassy, 
UNHCR, and a few NGOs provided coverage at the airport until 
the last outbound commercial flight to China departed at 2:00 
a.m. December 19 with no sign the Uighurs had been moved from 
the detention facility.  The same groups monitored 
commericial flight departures bound for China at 8:00 a.m. 
and 11:30 a.m. December 19, with no sign of the Uighurs. 
 
¶12.  (C) Reports indicated that police removed the Uighur 
group at gunpoint from the safe house and transported them to 
the detention center at the MOI compound around 6:00 p.m. 
December 18.  According to text messages coming from a mobile 
phone belonging to the one woman in the group, and likely 
written by the the one Uighur who arrived May 31 and who 
spoke English, the 20 Uighurs were held in two small cells at 
the detention center; many were kept handcuffed.  Reports 
indicated police were rough with several of the Uighurs 
during the removal from the safe house.

Deportation 
----------- 
 
¶13.  (C) A JRS observer saw a bus entering the MOI compound 
around 3:00 p.m. December 19.  Monitoring at the airport 
continued at 4:45 p.m. after discussion with multiple sources 
unearthed credible information that a chartered jet from 
China would arrive to transport the Uighurs back to China. 
At 7:15 p.m., JRS observers monitoring the Ministry of 
Interior compound reported that a bus with curtains drawn on 
all windows departed the MOI compound under police escort. 
JRS attempted to follow the bus, but eventually lost it in 
traffic.  By 7:40 p.m., UNHCR observers stationed near the 
entrance to the military airbase reported seeing a similar 
bus enter the secured area. 
 
¶14.  (C) Shortly thereafter UNHCR also observed a plane 
approaching for a landing at the airport, although no 
commercial flight arrival was scheduled.  Minutes later, 
Embassy and NGO observers at the main airport saw a plane 
taxiing without lights from the runway towards the airbase, 
followed shortly thereafter by a fuel truck and truck-mounted 
boarding stairs.  Observers could not see the plane 
thereafter, and were unable to see if or when boarding

occurred.  NGO observers stated that a plane suddenly 
reappeared from the far side of the airport at 8:55 p.m., 
taxiing directly to the runway.  MOI spokesman Khieu Sopheak 
stated that the plane carrying 20 Uighurs departed at 9:15 
p.m. bound for China.  Observers asked airport ground staff 
which plane it was, and were told the plane was a "VIP plane 
to China" that was not on the regular departure schedule. 
The Embassy confirmed the unscheduled nature of the departure 
after checking to see that all regularly scheduled commercial 
flights were still on the ground. 
 
------------ 
NGO Response 
------------ 
 
¶15.  (SBU) NGOs and international organizations immediately 
condemned the deportation in the strongest possible terms. 
UNHCR expressed deep distress at this "grave breach of 
international refugee law."  Country Representative for the 
UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights 
Christophe Peschoux said the decision violated not just the 
UN Refugee Convention, but also the Convention Against 
Torture and the Convention on Civil and Political Rights. 
The head of JRS, Sister Denise Coghlan, called the 
deportation "a betrayal of trust and a terrible 
violation...given that we've seen a realtively humane policy 
to refugees until now."
