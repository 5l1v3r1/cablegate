SUBJECT: (C) UPDATE ON UIGHUR ASYLUM-SEEKERS IN CAMBODIA 
 
REF: PHNOM PENH 913 
 
Classified By: AMBASSADOR CAROL A. RODLEY FOR REASONS 1.4 (B, D) 
 
¶1.  (C) Representatives of the United Nations High Commission 
on Refugees (UNHCR) and the Royal Government of Cambodia 
(RGC) are close to finding a new location for the Uighur 
asylum-seekers in Phnom Penh that would offer improved 
protection.  According to UNHCR, the goal is to house the 
Uighurs in a separate, single house and officials have 
identified two possible locations.  They are working toward 
finalizing a contract one of the properties.  In the 
meantime, to improve protection for the group immediately, 
the group is being moved December 16 to UNHCR's Montagnard 
Site 3, the last remaining Montagnard site in Phnom Penh, 
which houses approximately 90 Montagnard asylum-seekers and 
refugees.  The move to Site 3 is a temporary relocation, as a 
separate dwelling is believed to be the best solution for the 
Uighurs.  During the move, it was discovered that two Uighurs 
were no longer present, and are believed to have run away on 
their own. 
 
¶2.  (C) Refugee assistance groups expressed some concern 
about the issue of access to the Uighurs once they are moved 
to a new location.  In conversation, UNHCR officials are not 
committing to maintaining access to the Uighurs by those 
providing humanitarian assistance, or the Uighurs' access to 
outside legal representation.  UNHCR says these concerns are 
"under discussion" and ultimately for the RGC to decide. 
UNHCR Senior Protection Officer Toshi Kawauchi told Poloff 
the most important issue is finding a secure place for the 
Uighurs first, and then they will turn to considerations of 
access.  (COMMENT:  Post believes it is crucial to establish 
rules of access from the outset, before the group is moved, 
rather than trying to break through a barrier once the group 
relocates.  We understand Bangkok RefCoord Office is engaging 
Bangkok UNHCR on this issue.  END COMMENT.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Cambodian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) 
publicly confirmed Chinese government interest in the case on 
December 14.  MFA spokesman Koy Kuong said the Chinese 
Embassy in Phnom Penh sent a diplomatic note referring to the 
"Uighur Chinese," but did not release the contents of the 
note.  On December 15, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign 
Ministry stated that the Uighurs are "involved in crimes," 
and "the international refugee protection system should not 
be a haven for criminals to evade legal sanctions." 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The RGC has maintained that it will not return any 
Uighur to China who is determined to have a legitimate 
political asylum claim, nor will they return anyone facing 
prosecution for those crimes in which the death sentence is a 
penalty.  MFA spokesman Koy Kuong told the local press on 
December 15 that "the Cambodian government has not made any 
decision yet.  We are waiting until interviews are done to 
find the real status of these people."  (NOTE: Post will 
speak with contacts working with the Uighurs to learn more 
about the asylum-seekers' personal histories.  END NOTE.)
