¶1. (SBU) Costa Rica will abstain from the upcoming vote at the 
United Nations on the "Defamation of Religions" resolution.  Costa 
Rican MFA Director of Foreign Policy Alejandro Solano told us that 
the GOCR sees serious problems with the resolution, and believes it 
is much too restrictive.  The GOCR is concerned about the 
persecution of minority religions in Muslim countries, and believes 
that each state has a responsibility to promote tolerance and 
intercultural dialogue . 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) However, according to Solano the GOCR will not vote 
against the resolution because they want to recognize the 
underlying problem that the Arab bloc is trying to address-that of 
"islamaphobia".  Solano believed the GOCR's abstention would signal 
their condemnation of anti-Muslim discrimination, and their 
willingness to work with others on finding a durable solution to 
this issue.
