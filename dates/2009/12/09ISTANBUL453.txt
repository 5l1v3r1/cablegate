REF: SECSTATE 99612 
 
¶1.   (SBU)  Summary:  In response to reftel, Consulate 
economic officers visited the offices of PROFEN Muhendislik 
(Engineering) Sanayi Ticaret on December 2, 2009 and met with 
Managing Director Onder Havuzlu, Sales Director Sadettin 
Avcilar and Sales Director Ilgar Alibeyli.  The purpose of 
this visit was to establish the bona fides of the company and 
its managing director, Onder Havuzlu, and to review reftel 
questions.  Company representatives were cooperative in 
responding to our questions and, based on the site visit and 
the information provided by company representatives, we 
believe PROFEN is a legitimate company engaged in the 
brokering of defense articles and services. End summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  PROFEN Engineering, founded in 1995, is in the 
business of brokering defense articles and defense services 
at the Istanbul address cited in reftel.  PROFEN's officers 
stated that satellite communications equipment, wireless and 
point-to-point products account for 50-60% of its sales 
revenue (USD 12-13 million in 2008); project design, 
maintenance and installation account for the rest of its 
revenue.  PROFEN has two floors in FAMAS PLAZA in the Sisli 
district of Istanbul, and other offices in Istanbul and 
Tuzla; Havuzlu added that they also have an office in 
Azerbaijan.  PROFEN has two other operating divisions: 
PROFEN Communications and PROFEN ICT (Information and 
Commercial Technology). The company has 50-60 employees. 
FOX-TV is PROFEN's largest domestic commercial customer. 
PROFEN's principal shareholders are:  Onder Havuzlu (managing 
director), Sadettin Avcilar (sales director), Ilgar Alibeyli 
(sales director), Murat Surucu and Nuri Hacigucuoglu. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  PROFEN officers stated that the company does not 
deal in USML (U.S. Military List) items, and is not 
registered with PM/DTCC (Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance).  It does have a recently expired local broker 
registration number (K-1872, Expiration Date 10/31/2009). 
Though PROFEN does not have specific authorization from 
Turkey's Ministry of National Defense, it does receive 
technical inspection by Information and Communication 
Technologies Authority, which was established by Turkish law 
in January 2000.  Havuzlu offered that for almost all of 
their items (military or commercial) the company uses an end 
user application form in which it specifies the customers who 
will eventually use the item.  Some items can be dual-use 
(antennae, certain electronic products); if the end user is 
military, PROFEN applies for an export license and uses a 
Department of Defense broker number.  General Dynamics is a 
major U.S. business partner of PROFEN (PROFEN works with GD 
Satellite Technologies, under GD C4 Systems) and in the past 
has applied for an export license to sell goods to PROFEN. 
Many of PROFEN's clients are subcontractors, or other 
organizations that do business with the military.  Among 
these are SAVRONIK, TUBITAK, ASERSEN, STFA,VESTAL, GATE AND 
TAI. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  Consulate officers found nothing in the public 
record to indicate criminal activity on the part of PROFEN, 
nor any derogatory information about its officers.  PROFEN 
does not broker or export items to Iran, North Korea or Cuba. 
 It does nonmilitary business with Iraq, Libya, Syria and 
Sudan.  PROFEN officers declared that the company does not 
store or handle USML items, only commercial items like 
antennae.
