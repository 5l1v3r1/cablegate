Center-right, Rio de Janeiro-based newspaper, O Globo writes: "By 
showing up...and electing Porfirio Lobo for President, the Honduran 
people...bought the idea of a  fresh start..The crisis in Honduras 
highlighted the new central role of Brazil's foreign policy, but 
also showed how it has moved toward the left in recent 
months...Brazil ... insisted that the election was illegitimate 
without Zelaya's restoration...It is not a coincidence that this is 
the same position defended by Bolivarians...Hopefully Itamaraty 
[the Brazilian Foreign Ministry] has seriously considered the pros 
and cons of its decision to align with Ch????vez and oppose the U.S. 
The visit by Iranian President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, is part of 
Brazil's attempt to open new diplomatic fronts, even with a high 
political cost. Lula  lent prestige to the Iranian with the 
message, without caveats, that Tehran has the right to generate 
nuclear power for peaceful purposes...Lula commented on the issue 
yesterday in Germany, asking Chancellor Angela Merkel for more 
patience with Tehran and denying that U.S. and Russia have the 
moral authority to pressure the ayatollahs...The truth is that the 
performance of Brazil's diplomacy, whether for domestic electoral 
reasons or not, risks the reputation Lula has gained. Adding to 
this is...Special Advisor Marco Aurelio Garcia making perplexing 
criticisms of foreign leaders, such as Obama. These are hasty moves 
which damage the image of the President's country [Brazil], and 
could be harmful to the national interest" (Dec 4, 2009).
