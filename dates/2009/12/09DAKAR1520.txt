SUBJECT: Ahmedinejad in Dakar; Wade Comments on Iran's Civil Nuclear 
Program 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: On November 26, Iranian President Mahmoud 
Ahmedinejad made a twelve-hour stop in Dakar, en route to Teheran 
from Latin America.  President Wade took the opportunity to 
reiterate his support for Iran's right to a civilian nuclear program 
while President Ahmedinejad announced that he will help Senegal in 
the fields of agriculture and energy.  Meanwhile, despite the money, 
T-shirts, and flags deployed by the ruling party to hail the visit, 
supporters were on the whole too busy buying sheep for the Eid 
religious feast to come out in large numbers to greet the Iranian 
President.  End summary. 
 
Senegal supports Iran 
--------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Addressing the media with President Ahmedinejad, President 
Wade reiterated his support to Iran saying that, as long as Iran 
does not enrich uranium for military purposes, Senegal will be on 
its side.  Wade added, "I told Ahmedinejad that Senegal is against 
the proliferation of nuclear weapons and my position on this is not 
a secret.  I bear witness to the fact the President of Iran has 
repeatedly told me that his country is processing uranium for 
civilian purposes."  President Wade further noted that IAEA 
inspectors had not found anything in Iran, musing, "You know, 
legally, those who level an accusation bear the burden of proof. 
And in the case of Iran, so far no evidence has been presented." 
 
Iranian Assistance to Senegal 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) President Ahmedinejad announced that he will continue to 
support Senegal's effort to develop an automotive industry through 
the car assembly line that the Iranian company Khodro established in 
Thies, Senegal.  He also promised to deliver one thousand tractors 
to support President Wade's agricultural program, GOANA.  Finally, 
he indicated that Iran will be involved in the construction of a 
storage facility for oil products in Senegal.  The reality is that 
there has been many visits back and forth between Teheran and Dakar 
but little can be shown beyond rhetoric.  The car assembly plant in 
Thies appears to be idle.  During the past two years, Iranian 
vehicles have been imported, not assembled in Senegal, and are 
currently used as taxis in Dakar.  These taxis were lined up along 
the road as part of the welcome for Ahmedinejad.  Realizing the 
paucity of actual development assistance, President Wade accused 
former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Cheikh Tidiane Gadio, of having 
stifled relations with Iran, "Gadio never wanted to go to Teheran." 
In a joint press release, the two Presidents announced that a 
bilateral relations committee meeting will be held in Teheran in 
February 2010 to review and reinforce relations between the two 
countries. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) One of President Wade's diplomatic strategies is to ally 
with isolated leaders to attract attention from the international 
community.  In the case of Iran, Wade hopes to gain influence and 
play a role in the freeing of French citizen Francoise Clotilde 
Reiss from detention in Iran and then be called upon by the Group of 
Six to help soften Iran's position regarding its nuclear program. 
Wade still harbors dreams of winning the Nobel Peace Prize as a 
culmination of his career and to this end he continues to take bold 
and sometimes obtuse positions with the aim of securing a seat at 
the table in the resolution of international crises.  End comment.
