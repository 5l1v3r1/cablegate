SUBJECT:  UNHCR IN IRAQ OUTLINE OF MONITORING AND EVALUATION PLAN 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Assistance Refugee Coordinator met with UNHCR 
Deputy Representative Shoko Shimozawa and Senior Program Officer 
Naomi Kawahara on December 6 to discuss Post's monitoring and 
evaluation (M&E) plan for the agency in Iraq.  In December and 
January UNHCR will provide Post with a presentation of its 2009 
performance and outline its work plan for 2010.  The agency will 
provide similar quarterly reporting to Post thereafter, in addition 
to normal monthly updates.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) RefCoord approached UNHCR to discuss M&E of the agency's 
operations.  RefCoord noted that we would like to gain a better 
understanding of the agency's progress on its work plans in its 
various sectors (such as shelter, protection, and non-food item 
distribution), financial pipeline, and budget execution.  The M&E 
plan would also involve qualitative analysis drawn from site visits 
and interviews with beneficiaries and other stakeholders such as 
government officials and non-governmental organization (NGO) 
implementing partners.  RefCoord stated that Post wants to 
collaborate on this plan -- and does not wish to impose overly 
burdensome requirements on the agency -- but does desire regular 
reporting on UNHCR's main sectors. 
 
¶3. (U) Shimozawa responded that UNHCR would be happy to work with 
RefCoord to obtain the necessary information.  She noted that in 
some sectors, such as shelter, the agency tracks progress according 
to implementing partner, i.e., the non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) who typically engage across a range of sectors, making a 
sectoral breakdown more difficult. Beginning in 2010, however, 
Iraq's operations would be executed through the new "Focus" software 
system, which links a results-based management framework to its 
operational plan, budget, and staffing.  Thus, in 2010, the agency 
will be able to analyze its operations in a variety of ways, 
including by sector, more easily, she said.  RefCoord responded that 
Post would be like to begin monitoring by sector and other ways 
(such as by geographical location) in 2010, and that an analysis by 
implementing partner -- when sector analysis was not possible -- 
would be acceptable.  Shimozawa and RefCoord agreed that the agency 
would brief Post of both its 2009 results and 2010 plans in late 
December and January, 2010. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Shimozawa noted, however, that 2010 planning would be 
revised throughout the year because UNHCR will receive its funding 
in tranches.  The briefing in January would include an overview of 
the first tranche of $75 million, $55 million of which would be 
allocated to operations, in January.  (Note:  The other $20 million 
would fund overhead, staff and administration.  End note.)  She 
noted this funding would likely have to last the agency until July 
because other allocations were not expected until then. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment:  The approach discussed with UNHCR should 
reinforce Post's M&E of UNHCR.  We plan to undertake a similar 
approach with the International Organization for Migration, and also 
to develop a travel plan that will include specific M&E for a range 
of projects on a regular basis.  We appreciate ongoing cooperation 
from PRM/ANE and PRM/PRP as we enhance and refine our M&E efforts. 
End Comment.
