activities in Egypt.  El-Hassan Trading provides consulting 
services and technical support for military customers in

confirmed that he was familiar with restrictions on USML 
items, including the unauthorized re-transfer and re-export 
of items.

included providing follow-on support for radar systems 
belonging to the Egyptian Air Defense and providing
