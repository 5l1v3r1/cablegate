"Lula Is No Longer 'The Man'" 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S. Paulo (12-22) notes: 
"Brazil lost political prestige with Washington.  The enthusiasm 
demonstrated by President Obama in April when he called his 
Brazilian counterpart 'the man' in London [at the G-20 Summit] 
seems to have faded.  After many disagreements, the visit of the 
U.S. President Barack Obama to Brazil is now uncertain.....In a 
short time, Lula [has] managed to poison, with no economic or 
political gain to the country, the ambience of good will which 
existed under the former Republican administration and continued 
into the beginning of the Obama administration."
