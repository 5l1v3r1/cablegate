SUBJECT: SWEDEN'S INTERIM REPLY ON DRAFT MOU ON LIFE, 
SECURITY AND MOBILITY SUPPORT 
 
REF: A. STATE 129187 
     ¶B. STOCKHOLM 750 
 
¶1. (SBU) On December 21, POL Counselor delivered ref A points 
to Carl Magnus Ericsson, Deputy Director of the MFA 
International Security Policy Department, and Cecilia 
Helander of the MOD Security Policy Department.  Ericsson 
stated that Sweden very much welcomes Washington's general 
approach of expanding the USG presence in the Swedish PRT 
region.  MFA, MOD and the Swedish Armed Forces are carefully 
studying the draft MOU "with the ambition of accommodating 
the expanded USG presence as much as possible."  There are, 
however, certain issues that need further discussion and 
clarification, Ericsson said, including: 
 
--The request in MOU section VI part E for "outside the wire" 
force protection.  This could be "one step too far" for the 
Swedish military, Helander stated.  The Swedish Armed Forces 
will soon deliver a formal report on its ability to 
facilitate secure ground movements for the increased number 
of USG personnel, but MOD understands the preliminary finding 
to be that the 500 Swedish troops currently deployed in 
RC-North would not/not be able to take on the additional 
burdens entailed by a tripling or more of the USG civilian 
presence. 
 
--Another issue of concern, Ericsson said, is how the planned 
opening of U.S. Consulate Mazar and the increased staffing 
there affects earlier requests relayed in Mazar for Swedish 
support for 2-3 USG civilians in each of three proposed U.S. 
provincial offices in Saripol, Samangan and Jowzjan 
Provinces.  Does the draft MOU cover the 8-10 USG civilians 
expected to come to Mazar only, or also the others going to 
the provincial offices?  Space in Swedish facilities in the 
provincial offices is "very tight right now" but would be 
increasing next year.  MFA and MOD are currently "looking at 
timetables" and expect to be in a position to accommodate and 
expanded USG presence in the provincial capitals at some 
point in the future. 
 
--The planned opening of a Turkish PRT in Jowzjan (ref B) 
will also impact the regional security and force protection 
responsibilities of Swedish troops, Ericsson stated (see 
septel). 
 
¶2. (SBU) POL Counselor emphasized the importance of a timely 
response to the draft MOU.  Ericsson said Sweden will have a 
formal reply early in the new year.  Returning to the issue 
of proposed provincial offices, he said he understood that 
bilateral discussions will and ought to continue in Mazar and 
Kabul, but also emphasized that formal consultation in 
Stockholm should be part of the dialogue.  "We really want to 
accommodate you, but the central government in Stockholm must 
be consulted," he stated.
