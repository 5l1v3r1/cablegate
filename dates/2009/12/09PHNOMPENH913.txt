SUBJECT: (C) AMBASSADOR MEETS UNHCR TO DISCUSS UIGHURS 
 
Classified By: DCM THEODORE ALLEGRA FOR REASONS 1.4 (B, D) 
 
¶1.  (C) SUMMARY:  During a meeting December 14 with 
Ambassador Rodley, United Nations High Commission for 
Refugees (UNHCR) officials recounted a "very positive" 
discussion with Royal Government of Cambodia (RGC) officials 
regarding the 22 Uighur asylum-seekers in Cambodia. 
According to UNHCR, the RGC reaffirmed its commitment to the 
Refugee Convention principles and requested UNHCR's 
assistance in providing interpretation and protection for the 
Uighurs.  The UNHCR officials opined that it would be several 
weeks before the cases would all be adjudicated, during which 
time more secure protection would be provided.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (C) Ambassador met December 14 with UNHCR officials 
Deputy Regional Representative from Thailand Giuseppe de 
Vincentis and Senior Protection Officer in Phnom Penh 
Toshitsuki Kawauchi.  De Vincentis related the results of his 
meeting with Deputy Prime Minister (DPM) and Minister of 
Interior Sar Kheng earlier the same morning, and 
characterized the meeting as very positive.  The RGC 
reaffirmed at the outset its commitment to abide by the 
Refugee Convention principles and confirmed its interest in 
continuing with the joint refugee status determination 
process, which has been the standard procedure in asylum 
cases since late 2008. 
 
¶3.  (C) De Vincentis informed the Ambassador that the RGC 
requested UNHCR assistance in two areas: interpretation and 
protection.  The RGC specifically requested interpreters to 
assist with status determination interviews.  On that, De 
Vincentis said he told the DPM that a Mandarin-speaking 
interpreter from Bangkok has been assigned to assist with the 
four or five cases where the asylum-seekers speak Mandarin, 
and that interpreter was expected to arrive in Phnom Penh on 
December 15.  For the remaining asylum-seekers who do not 
speak Mandarin, a likely Uighur interpreter from Kazakhstan 
has been identified, and UNHCR is working to bring that 
interpreter to Phnom Penh within a few days. 
 
¶4.  (C) On providing protection and security, De Vincentis 
said that he and Sar Kheng agreed to relocate the Uighurs 
from their current unsecured locations to a single site with 
improved security.  De Vincentis said that UNHCR officers are 
now working to locate an acceptable site, with a view toward 
moving the group on December 15 or 16.  The Ambassador 
welcomed this news, but stressed the importance of having 
UNHCR protection officers or, at the very least, a protection 
advocate from Jesuit Refugee Services, at the site to protect 
against unofficial contact by unauthorized agents. 
 
¶5.  (C) De Vincentis said that Sar Kheng also emphasized his 
desire to expedite these cases.  Although UNHCR would 
expedite cases, where possible, De Vincentis noted that UNHCR 
could not act too precipitously, stating that every case 
should receive careful attention and consideration.  The 
Ambassador urged immediate action on the Uighur cases, 
however, given the large official Chinese presence in 
Cambodia, the strong ties between the RGC and Government of 
China, and the wide latitude for operation of Chinese agents 
in Cambodia.  In response to Ambassador's question, De 
Vincentis said Sar Kheng did not directly raise the issue of 
official intervention from China, but made reference to the 
RGC's "difficult position due to pressure from outside 
forces."  The Ambassador emphasized that the continued public 
silence by China could actually increase the likelihood of 
risk to the group. 
 
¶6.  (C) Responding to the Ambassador's question about the 
duration of the refugee status determination process, De 
Vincentis emphasized that the Uighur cases may take longer 
than usual due to interpretation issues or other complicating 
factors.  All that said, he said he estimated that these 
cases could be resolved "within 2 or 3 weeks."  De Vincentis 
confirmed that UNHCR Geneva and Washington were equally 
focused on the situation, and said UNHCR would not hesitate 
to inform the Embassy if they encountered a need for 
assistance.
