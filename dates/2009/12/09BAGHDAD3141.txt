SUBJECT: SUSTAINED CORRECTIONS ADVISEMENT CRITICAL FOR 
SUCCESSFUL COALITION SECURITY DETAINEE TRANSFER 
 
REF: MANSO-INL/I E-MAILS 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  The U.S. military will transition several 
thousand mid-to-high threat coalition security detainees to 
the Government of Iraq (GOI) in 2010.  Task Force 134, which 
is charged with detainee operations, stresses the need to 
maintain a sufficient number of corrections advisors in 
selected Iraqi Corrections Service (ICS) facilities 
throughout the transition process to guarantee both Iraqi 
institutional capacity and international human rights 
standards.  Current INL funding provides support to the 
corrections mission through March 2011.  As transition 
benchmarks slip, there will be diminishing advisory support 
and oversight on the ground during this crucial period. 
Commanding General Multi-National Force Iraq (MNF-I) General 
Odierno agrees that there is a continuing need for the 
corrections mission and that MNF-I should provide about an 
additional USD 8.8 million to fund it through January 2012. 
Embassy requests that the Department consider funding the 
remaining balance of roughly USD 4.4 million. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 
four. 
 
¶3. (SBU) TF 134 is scheduled to begin transitioning coalition 
security detainees to the ICS in February 2010, a process 
that was expected to conclude by August 2010.  However, the 
transition timeline is slipping due to GOI postponements 
(septel).  Currently, four corrections advisors support the 
coalition facilities housing security detainees.  TF 134 has 
requested an additional nine corrections advisors to support 
the transition through December 2011.  Based upon initial 
benchmarks, INL funding for the corrections mission extends 
through May 2010, allowing for a reduced number of advisors 
through March 2011.  There is no apparent funding source to 
meet TF 134,s request. 
 
¶4. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST: On November 19, the Ambassador and 
General Odierno agreed on the need for continued and 
increased ICS advisement and oversight at coalition 
facilities through December 2011.  The graduated drawdown of 
corrections advisors through 2011 will require an estimated 
additional USD 13.2 million.  General Odierno agreed to seek 
USD 8.8 million in FY2011.  Post requests that the Department 
fund the remaining USD 4.4 in FY2010 to provide adequate 
support to the ICS during this critical period.
