SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (12/01):  PA Calls on 
International Community to Take Decisive Measures; EU to Recognize 
Palestinian Capital 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
Independent daily Al-Quds leads with coverage of remarks given by 
Riyad Mansour, Permanent Palestinian observer, at the United Nations 
in New York yesterday, on behalf of President Abbas commemorating 
the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. 
Abbas' statement proclaimed that "it is time for the international 
community to take decisive measures that lead to a two state 
solution and end Israeli occupation." 
 
Citing Israeli daily Haaretz, Maan reports that EU's foreign 
ministers plan to recognize East Jerusalem as the capital of a 
future Palestinian state next week.  According to the story, 
Ha'aretz claimed it obtained a draft document (supposedly authored 
by Sweden, the current EU presidency) which outlines the EU's plan 
to recognize a unilateral Palestinian declaration of statehood. 
 
Palestinian Authority official daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida leads with 
the sarcastic headline "Israel Talks About Partial Settlement 
Freeze:  Netanyahu Approves Construction of 25 Housing Units." 
According to the article, Netanyahu approved the units in the Kidar 
Settlement in the West Bank because he did not considered those 
units to be included in the freeze.  The article did not provide 
details as to why Netanyahu considered the units exceptions to the 
moratorium. 
 
Local press continues reporting on the prisoner exchange deal 
despite conflicting information on the deal's status.  Citing 
Israeli TV, the dailies report that progress has been made and that 
the deal is nearing conclusion.   Independent news outlet Ma'an 
however, reports that the chief justice of Israel's highest court 
stated that the parties are far from a deal.  According to the 
article the parties disagree on 70 of the prisoners proposed for 
released. 
 
The dailies report that settlers from Yetzhar settlement attacked 
Palestinians in Bourin village near the northern West Bank city of 
Nablus yesterday.  Independent daily Al-Quds frontpages a photo of 
Israeli soldiers protecting a Palestinian house from the settlers' 
attack. 
Independent daily Al-Ayyam quotes Hamas official Mousa Abu Marzouq 
denying news that Hamas sent a delegation to Egypt to resume 
national reconciliation efforts.  Abu Marzouq called on the 
Egyptians to return items that were previously included in the 
reconciliation proposal. 
 
Maan reports that Bethlehem University student Berlanty Assam, who 
was deported to Gaza a month ago, appeared in an Israeli court 
yesterday.  A supporter who attended the hearing told Ma'an that the 
Holy See's envoy to the Holy Land promised to personally ensure 
Azzam's return to Gaza after graduation, but that the court rejected 
the proposal.  (Note:  Berlanty's legal representative has informed 
the Consulate that a follow up hearing for the case is scheduled for 
Sunday, November 6.)

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
Â¶1. Hani Al-Masri writing in Al-Ayyam under the headline "The Impact 
 
JERUSALEM 00002146  002 OF 002 
 
 
of the Prisoner Exchange Deal on the Palestinian Map," urges Hamas 
to become more flexible after the exchange is concluded to focus on 
national reconciliation and achieving unity.  Al-Masri opines that 
Hamas has to understand that Israel will never favor Hamas over 
Fatah or Fatah over Hamas.  In his opinion, Israel will empower both 
Hamas and Fatah to avoid strengthening any Palestinian faction to 
dominate the Palestinian scene. 
 
2) Al-Quds runs an editorial entitled "Settlers ... Above the Law," 
in which it raises the issue that although Israel is considered the 
model for a democratic state in the Middle East, its settlers attack 
the Palestinians without any respect for law and order.  The writer 
rhetorical questions, "How would the situation be if the 
Palestinians were the ones who attacked the settlers?  Would the 
Israeli Government stay calm as it is now?" 
 
3) Hamdi Farraj writing in Al-Quds under the title "During Al-Adha 
Eid We Only Sacrificed Animals," calls on Hamas and Fatah to think 
of the national interests of the Palestinian people, to sacrifice 
and work towards achieving national reconciliation for their 
people.
