DERIVED FROM: Derived from previous message. 
 
¶1.       (S) Econoff delivered talking points in reftel to Bernardo 
Mota, Chief of Staff of the Brazilian financial intelligence unit 
(COAF), on December 14.  Mota said that Brazil is fully compliant 
with UNSCR 1803 and that he is unaware of any presence or economic 
activity in the country by any Iranian bank, including the Export 
Development Bank of Iran (EDBI).  He said that he would pass on the 
United States' concerns regarding EDBI's attempts to find new 
markets to the appropriate contacts at the Brazilian Central Bank. 
 
 
 
¶2.       (S) Mota also opined that Brazil "shot itself in the foot" 
by hosting Iranian President Ahmadinejad in November.  Ricardo 
Pires Ribeiro, Desk Director for Iran and Central Asia at the 
Ministry of Exterior Relations, told Poloff in October that they 
were negotiating a Memorandum of Understanding between the Central 
Banks of Iran and Brazil, but later said the MOU was no longer 
being considered.  Mota did not comment on the specific 
negotiations, but said the understanding of COAF and the Central 
Bank is that any such MOU would violate Brazil's obligations under 
the Financial Action Task Force and UN frameworks.
