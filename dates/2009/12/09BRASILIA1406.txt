¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  The First International Symposium on 
Biosecurity and Dual Use Research held in Brazil brought together 
Latin American experts and policymakers dealing with biosecurity. 
The conference highlighted the national security threats emerging 
from the advances in the biological sciences, and it underscored 
that the USG was a resource and partner for the region in 
addressing these new challenges.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) On September 21 the Brazilian National Biosafety 
Association (AnBio), with support from ISN/CTR's Biosecurity 
Engagement Program (BEP), held the First International Symposium on 
Biosecurity and Dual Use Research in Rio de Janeiro.  This 
symposium was the first of its kind in Latin America, aimed at 
starting a conversation about the implications of dual use research 
on the growing topics of biosafety and biosecurity.  The keynote 
speaker, AnBio President Dr. Leila Macedo Oda, stressed how the 
rapid growth in biological sciences is fueling a growing problem of 
biosecurity in the region.  She said that many new avenues of 
research in the biological sciences have important implications for 
the advance of science and medicine, but they also raise the 
potential for dangerous misuse.  She saw many parallel national 
security policy questions regarding advances in biological science 
to those connected with nuclear technology. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Other speakers focused on specific aspects of the 
biosecurity and dual use dilemma.  Their talks covered laboratory 
controls and issues related to policy design and implementation. 
USG speakers included representatives from the National Academies 
of Science and the Centers for Disease Control.  Other speakers 
came from a diverse group of Latin American and European countries. 
Many of the participants and attendees praised Dr. Oda for her 
efforts to highlight this increasingly important issue and start a 
dialog that will help policymakers from throughout the region begin 
to grapple with the challenges that it presents. 
 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT.  This symposium was important in bringing 
together Latin American experts and policymakers to discuss 
biosecurity, which is an area of growing concern.  Through this 
meeting and the USG representation, the USG was able to highlight 
its value as a resource and partner in addressing issues of 
biosecurity.  Further, the participants began to establish 
connections with counterparts in the region, helping to build a 
network of contacts and expanding the pool of expertise on which to 
draw when grappling with biosecurity.  END COMMENT.
