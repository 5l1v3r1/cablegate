SUBJECT:   Baby Traffickers Resurface in Alexandria 
 
REFS: CAIRO 1828 and previous 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: An American Citizen couple attempted to register a 
newborn as their biological child during a scheduled consular 
outreach visit held at the American Center in Alexandria.  The 
couple fit the profile developed by the Cairo Fraud Prevention Unit 
(FPU) in reftels and the case was referred to Egyptian authorities 
for further investigation.  The couple subsequently admitted that 
the newborn was not their biological child and paying about USD 70 
for the premature infant.  Egyptian authorities have detained the 
alleged birth mother and have issued a warrant for the arrest of the 
doctor who falsely attested to delivering the baby. End Summary. 
 
Suspicion of Fraud 
------------------ 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) After more than a year of local and international media 
attention on the baby trafficking cases uncovered by the FPU in 
reftels, another case has surfaced. The couple, who was attempting 
to obtain a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA) and passport for 
their alleged newborn, appeared at the American Center in Alexandria 
during a consular outreach visit by the American Citizens Services 
(ACS) unit on December 6.  The keen eye of an Entry Level Officer 
quickly identified the case as fitting the profile developed by FPU 
and referred the case to the Fraud Prevention Manager (FPM). 
 
FPU Confirms Fraud 
------------------ 
 
¶3. (SBU) The Senior Fraud Investigator spoke with the doctor who 
allegedly delivered the child.  The doctor admitted that she 
provided a bogus letter attesting to the birth, and that she had 
never met the couple.  A visit by another Fraud Investigator to the 
clinic where the woman allegedly gave birth confirmed that the 
clinic handled only blood tests, not childbirths.  When confronted 
with this information, the couple admitted the newborn was not their 
biological child. They indicated they had received the child from a 
local Coptic hospital in Alexandria and had paid a nominal fee of 
about USD 70. 
 
Egyptian Authorities Confirm Fraud 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) Egyptian State Security Investigative Services (SSIS) 
arrested the couple as they left the American Center and referred 
them to a local prosecutor for questioning.  The Amcit husband 
assumed all responsibility for the illegal adoption and the 
prosecutor subsequently released his Amcit spouse, but barred her 
from leaving Egypt pending the results of the investigation.  The 
prosecutor also ordered the questioning of the doctor, hospital 
staff, and the alleged real birth mother who lives in Cairo. 
 
 
FPU and SSIS Cooperation Yields Results 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Unable to locate the doctor with only a cell phone number 
and partial name, SSIS asked for help from the FPU. Using the Text 
Search function of the Consular Consolidated Database (CCD), the FPM 
located a Diversity Visa record for the doctor and her family.  The 
records indicated that the family had received Legal Permanent 
Resident (LPR) status in 2008. Based on experience with the cases in 
Cairo involving baby trafficking, the FPU advised SSIS that the 
doctor might attempt to flee Egypt for the United States.  SSIS 
promptly entered the doctor's name on to their watch list to prevent 
her from leaving Egypt.  Later the same day, the doctor was stopped 
trying to leave from Cairo International Airport.  SSIS in 
Alexandria has requested a background briefing by the FPM and 
A/RSO-I to understand how this case fits into the bigger picture 
developed in Cairo. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶6. (SBU) The investigation of the case is ongoing and will 
undoubtedly uncover further details.  It also has the potential of 
uncovering a baby trafficking network in Alexandria similar to the 
one uncovered in Cairo. Currently, there are more questions than 
answers.  A key question remains identifying who coordinated the 
travel of the alleged birth mother from Cairo to a particular 
hospital in Alexandria to give birth prematurely, days before the 
arrival of the Amcit couple? Post will continue to report on this
