SUBJECT: UKRAINE FOREIGN MINISTER'S CASE FOR IMF LOAN 
 
REF: A. KYIV 2133 
     ¶B. KYIV 2130 
 
Classified By: Ambassador John F. Tefft for Reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1.  (C) Summary. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Poroshenko 
described meetings with IMF deputy managing director Lipsky 
as "not constructive" and relations more generally with the 
IMF as "very bad".  Poroshenko told the Ambassador on 
December 13 that he had weighed in with the Constitutional 
Court to strike down the IMF-criticized social standards law, 
and that he had asked the President to overcome his 
"politically motivated" opposition to the IMF Letter of 
Intent (LOI).  Describing Ukraine's situation as "dangerous", 
Poroshenko said even a partial IMF disbursement would ensure 
payments to Gazprom and foreign creditors.  End summary. 
 
FOREIGN MINISTER DOWNBEAT ON IMF 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C) Foreign Minister Poroshenko told the Ambassador that, 
after meeting with IMF deputy managing director Lipsky in 
Washington on December 11, it was clear Ukraine's current 
situation was "dangerous" and relations with the IMF were 
"very bad".  Talks with Lipsky over disbursing the IMF's 
fourth tranche were described as "not constructive". 
 
¶3.  (C) Addressing recent IMF-criticized legislation 
increasing social payments, Poroshenko told the Ambassador 
that he had spoken with the Chairman of the Constitutional 
Court.  The Court had indicated it would cancel provisions of 
the budget-busting social standards law on constitutional 
grounds, according to Poroshenko, but only after the 
presidential election. 
 
¶4.  (C) Poroshenko conceded that President Yushchenko had 
refused to sign the LOI for political reasons.  Even though 
the President otherwise had "no influence" over economic 
policy, Poroshenko had called Yushchenko from Washington to 
brief him on his December 10 meeting with the Secretary and 
had asked him to consider accommodating the IMF. 
 
¶5.  (C) In any case, Poroshenko argued, Yushchenko's 
signature would be meaningless, since there was no prospect 
of the Rada adopting an IMF-compliant budget before the 
election.  (Comment: With this statement, Poroshenko may have 
been attempting to deflect criticism of the President's 
refusal to sign the LOI.  However, the IMF would have 
considered disbursing at least a partial fourth tranche had 
Yushchenko signed the LOI and had the Cabinet of Ministers 
re-submitted a draft 2010 budget.  With a presidential 
signature, the IMF would have waived the requirement to pass 
the 2010 budget.  End comment.) 
 
¶6.  (C) Poroshenko suggested that a partial IMF disbursement 
would be adequate for Ukraine's budget, gas, and debt payment 
needs.  Additionally, an IMF disbursement would also free up 
contingent loan offers from the EBRD, World Bank, and the 
European Investment Bank.  Poroshenko said the IMF's Lipsky 
had suggested getting a "bridge loan" from some other source 
to pull the country through the immediate crisis.  Shaking 
his head, Poroshenko told the Ambassador that, without any 
monies forthcoming, the $12 billion disbursed so far by the 
IMF would have been "wasted."  (Note: Poroshenko's 
calculations likely include three tranches of the IMF's 
Stand-By Arrangement, as well as roughly $2 billion 
transferred in IMF Special Drawing Rights.  End note.) 
 
GLOOMY ON FINANCES 
------------------ 
 
¶7.  (C) Although Ukraine could probably pay its gas bill in 
January, it would likely not be able to do so in February, 
according to Poroshenko.  External debt had grown in 2010 but 
remained modest overall.  The Foreign Minister said there was 
a real possibility of loan defaults threatening the already 
fragile banking system.  This would affect not just Ukrainian 
banks, he said.  December revenues for the government were 
abysmally low, reflecting low business profits and general 
credit problems throughout the economy.  VAT arrears were a 
major and growing concern.  The Foreign Minister admitted 
that he did not have a complete read on government finances, 
as acting Finance Minister Umanskiy had not assented to his 
request for details. 
 
¶8.  (C) Poroshenko said he told Lipsky that even a limited 
 disbursement to cover gas and other foreign debts would be 
enough to save Ukraine from massive defaults.  Lipsky had 
replied that Ukraine's external debt could be financed out of 
NBU reserves.  Poroshenko commented that this would 
over-expose state-owned banks to particular borrowers, since 
such banks are the only institutions that can legally receive 
central bank disbursements.  Poroshenko pointed to current 
exposure by state-owned banks to Naftogaz, which he said was 
already dangerous and threatened the stability of the banking 
system. 
 
CEYLA TO BE REPLACED 
-------------------- 
 
¶9.  (C) Poroshenko informed the Ambassador that IMF 
interlocutors had indicated Ceyla Pazarbasioglu was being 
replaced as Ukraine mission director.  The Foreign Minister 
expressed concern that this would hamper the IMF's engagement 
with Ukraine. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶10.  (C) Poroshenko had been tasked by Prime Minister 
Tymoshenko to ask Lipsky whether Ukraine could be included on 
the agenda of the IMF's next board meeting (ref B).  Based on 
what we heard separately from IMF resident representative Max 
Alier (ref A), Poroshenko's request was likely rebuffed by 
Lipsky, further underscoring the firm line the IMF has taken 
on Ukraine.  Reaching out to the Ambassador, Poroshenko was 
clearly seeking an ally on the IMF loan.  Yet, he made pains 
to show he was not taking sides in the dispute among 
Ukraine's presidential candidates, focusing instead on the 
country's dire predicament that he said would affect both 
current authorities and their successors.
