REF: STATE 126780 
 
¶1. (SBU) Embassy Beirut welcomes your visit to Lebanon, which 
will offer a unique opportunity to highlight the importance 
of scientific issues, from climate change to communications 
policy, at the highest levels of the GOL while raising 
general awareness among the public at large.  Although 
Lebanon is home to first-class institutions of higher 
learning and a variety of science education programs, 
Lebanon's science graduates often emigrate and take their 
expertise elsewhere, fleeing a job market where political 
connections often matter more than qualifications and a 
business environment where intellectual property protection 
is weak. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Years of political instability have left the state 
incapable of setting policy that could encourage science and 
technology (S&T) as a platform for development and undermined 
planning to address issues such as climate change or pandemic 
disease.  Nonetheless, an active NGO sector has replaced the 
government in many areas, advocating for improvements in 
Lebanon's telecommunications infrastructure to promote 
development, drafting environmental policies, and pushing for 
education in the sciences.  Recently, the new Prime Minister, 
Saad Hariri, has publicly promised to work with all parties 
in his national unity government to promote reform, and his 
economic advisors have indicated he is particularly 
interested in promoting information technology as a 
springboard for growth. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Subject to scheduling availability, Embassy Beirut 
proposes the following program for your visit, and welcomes 
your feedback: 
 
-- Meetings with President Michel Sleiman and Prime Minister 
Saad Hariri as a follow-up to President Obama's Cairo speech 
and to underscore USG commitment to building bridges in areas 
of scientific endeavor.  Should scheduling conflicts preclude 
these meetings, we propose appointments with the ministers of 
environment, health, education, or telecommunications. 
-- Visit to the National Council for Scientific Research, a 
governmental body responsible for S&T policy that provides 
modest research grants and supports several scientific 
research centers. 
-- Visit to the science and engineering facilities at one or 
more of Lebanon's universities: the American University of 
Beirut (AUB), the Lebanese American University (LAU), 
Saint-Joseph University, and/or the Lebanese University. 
-- Visit to IndyAct, Lebanon's premiere environmental NGO, 
which is very active both in Lebanon and in international 
fora in promoting environmental action.  IndyAct led a 
30-member delegation to the COP15 summit in Copenhagen and 
has played a leading role in advising the GOL on 
environmental topics. 
-- Visit to the Arab Forum for Environment and Development, a 
regional NGO which recently produced a short documentary on 
the effects of climate change on the Arab World and hosted a 
regional climate change conference in Beirut in November 2009. 
-- Visit to the Lebanese National Network (LNN), an NGO which 
launched SciLeb, which it describes as "a national network of 
educators and academicians dedicated to sustaining and 
increasing the advance of teaching, research, and educational 
applications in Lebanon."  SciLeb has sponsored teacher 
training courses and student participation in international 
science competitions and is active in over 150 schools in 
Lebanon. 
-- Meeting with the Lebanon Broadband Stakeholders Group, a 
gathering of private sector and civil society activists who 
advocate the improvement of Lebanon's technology 
infrastructure as a platform for development and job creation. 
-- Meeting with the Association for Forest Development and 
Conservation (AFDC), an organization that through U.S. Forest 
Service support (funded by USAID/Lebanon) has received 
technical training to improve Lebanon's capacity to combat 
forest fires that burn significant amounts of Lebanon's 
woodlands each year. 
-- A reception or dinner at the Ambassador's residence 
gathering public and private sector figures, as well as civil 
society activists, working on scientific issues. 
-- An exclusive interview with the Lebanese Broadcasting 
Corporation (LBC)'s Marcel Ghanem for his popular weekly 
talkshow, Kalam an-Nas, which would get both national and 
regional distribution.

¶4. (SBU) Several of the organizations mentioned above have 
benefitted from U.S. assistance, either through direct 
funding or through training from various USG agencies. 
IndyAct has sent representatives to Department of Interior 
training sessions on the Convention on International Trade in 
Endangered Species (CITES) and has USG funding to participate 
in Embassy Amman's upcoming regional workshop on S&T and the 
media.  LNN has received programming support funds through 
Public Diplomacy initiatives.  The American educational 
institutions AUB, LAU, and Haigazian receive scholarship and 
other grants from the USG and have strong networks of 
academic collaboration in the United States.  The Lebanese 
Ministry of Health has requested assistance to improve its 
epidemiological capacity, but has received none so far. 
There is ample room for increased collaboration between the 
U.S. and Lebanon on ESTH capacity-building and projects, and 
we look forward to your visit to pave the way for further 
cooperation.
