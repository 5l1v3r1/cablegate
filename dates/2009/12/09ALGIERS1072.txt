Â¶1. (SBU) Charge discussed reftel points with Algerian MFA 
Director General for the Americas, Sabri Boukhadoum on 
December 1.  Charge said we wanted to preview the President's 
speech because Algeria is a close partner in security matters 
and in light of Foreign Minister Medelci's upcoming visit to 
Washington.  Boukhadoum expressed appreciation for the 
preview of this important U.S. foreign policy announcement. 
He commented that although Afghanistan and Pakistan were far 
removed from North Africa, Algeria and its President followed 
events there closely:  Algeria continued to confront first 
hand Algerians who had fought in Afghanistan and then 
returned as radicals.  Partly to reduce this continuing 
phenomenon, Boukhadoum said that Algeria hopes that the U.S. 
commitment in Afghanistan will not be open-ended, as 
President Obama has promised.  He stressed the value of 
U.S.-Algerian cooperation on terrorism and, speaking as a 
newcomer to his position, said we should expand our overall 
relationship to the point where we are allies in all but 
name.
