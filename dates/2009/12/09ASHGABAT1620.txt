REF: ASHGABAT 1546 
 
¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) President Medvedev confirmed that his next visit to 
Turkmenistan will take place on December 22 during a phone 
conversation with President Berdimuhamedov on December 15. 
According to Turkmen media reports, Medvedev will hold negotiations 
with his Turkmen counterpart and will attend the opening ceremony of 
a new building for the Russian school in Ashgabat.  The Turkmen 
media also reported that, during the phone conversation, the two 
presidents discussed issues related to international policy and 
bilateral cooperation, including energy, industry, and military 
sectors. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Although the school opening is portrayed as the reason for 
Medvedev's visit to Ashgabat, his visit will most likely focus on 
gas trade issues (reftel).  The December 15 visit of Russian Deputy 
Prime Minister Igor Sechin to Ashgabat, who is in charge of the 
energy sector in the Russian Government, indirectly confirms this 
assumption.  During his stay in Ashgabat, Sechin reportedly met with 
Berdimuhamedov to deliver a personal written message from Medvedev 
and to convey greetings from Russian Prime Minister Putin.  The 
Turkmen media also reported that Berdimuhamedov and Sechin discussed 
bilateral projects in the energy sector as well as other areas of 
the economy.  Medvedev's message seems to have been something more 
than just seasonal congratulations; local newspapers have not 
published its text, which they usually do with congratulatory 
messages to the Turkmen President. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) COMMENT:  At this point it remains uncertain whether the 
long-awaited agreement regarding gas supplies will be finalized 
during Medvedev's upcoming visit.  Judging by the frequent visits by 
Russian high-ranking officials to Turkmenistan and the frequent 
meetings between the two presidents, it seems probable that the two 
sides have not yet given up on a new gas contract before the New 
Year.  END COMMENT.
