Prosecutorial Development, Assistance, and Training (OPDAT) and 
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),the DOJ International Criminal 
Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP), Department of 
State S/CT, and the NATO Center of Excellence are sponsoring a 
series of regional training workshops focusing on counterterrorism 
and border security beginning in February 2010 for law enforcement 
officials and prosecutors from Eastern Mediterranean countries.  The 
first three-day regional workshop is scheduled for February 10-12, 
2010, in Ankara, Turkey.  The countries invited to the February 
event are: Turkey, Albania, Bulgaria, Greece, Macedonia, and the 
United States. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The February session is expected to be the first in a 
series of similar regional workshops for the same five Eastern 
Mediterranean countries.  Subsequent sessions will address related 
issues.  Ideally, the participants of the February session will also 
attend subsequent sessions. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Separately invited speakers will give presentations and 
lead discussions on sub-topics related to: trends in terrorism, 
cross-border cooperation, biometric crime-fighting tools, terrorist 
financing, and document fraud.  The conference will be designed so 
that the participating countries can share their own best practices, 
discuss how they share information with other countries, and offer 
ideas on ways to improve cross-border cooperation and information 
sharing, particularly in terrorism cases.  The workshop is intended 
to provide an opportunity for countries in attendance to develop 
stronger crime-fighting relationships, build partnerships, and learn 
from one another's best practices.
