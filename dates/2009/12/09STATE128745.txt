SUBJECT: OSCE PERMANENT COUNCIL:  STATEMENT ON THE CLOSURE 
OF THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY PARTY IN TURKEY 
 
Madam Chair, 
 
The United States wishes to make the following points 
regarding the decision by the Constitutional Court of Turkey 
to close the Democratic Society Party and the violence that 
has occurred in its aftermath. 
 
We believe that Turkey's democratic system should continue to 
advance political freedoms for all its citizens.  Measures 
that limit or restrain these freedoms should be exercised 
with extreme caution. 
 
We encourage the Government of Turkey to continue its 
commendable efforts to ensure that all Turkish citizens fully 
exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship.  We 
encourage all political actors in Turkey to pursue 
reconciliation, reflect democratic values, and refrain from 
the use or encouragement of violence. 
 
Thank you Madam Chair.
