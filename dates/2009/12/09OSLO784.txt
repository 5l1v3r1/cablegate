Â¶1.  (SBU) Norway's MFA Legal Department Advisor Anita 
Bjorseth told PolOff December 22 that her department sent 
"small" suggested edits to the draft Memorandum of 
Understanding (MOU) on Life, Security and Mobility Support to 
the MFA's Af/Pak section on December 18.  She said most of 
comments she suggested throughout the text would be to ensure 
that it would not be a legally binding agreement, as 
specified in Reftel.  Separately, MFA Af/Pak Director 
Ambassador Janis Kanavin told PolOff that his section was 
reviewing the draft MOU, and would provide a reply as soon as 
possible.  He also said that Ministry of Defense and the MFA 
were discussing which ministry should be the signatory to the 
MOU.  Comment:  Post does not anticipate any significant 
Norwegian concerns or changes to the MOU.  However, it is 
unlikely the MOU will be signed before early 2010 due to the 
holidays.  End Comment.
