¶2. At the December 8 regularly scheduled Foreign Ministry press 
briefing, Spokesperson Jiang Yu said that China supported "contact 
and dialogue" between the United States and North Korea as a means 
of promoting mutual understanding and resolving mutual concerns. 
She stated that China hoped Special Representative for North Korea 
Policy Ambassador Stephen Bosworth's December 8 visit to the DPRK 
would lead to the resumption of the Six-Party Talks.  She noted that 
Ambassador Bosworth would visit Beijing December 11. 
 
Wen Jiabao Attending Climate Change Conference

Prime Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen to attend the UN Climate Change 
Conference in Copenhagen, Jiang said.  She stated that China 
supported adherence to the United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change (UNFCCC).  In order to reach consensus, she 
continued, the UNFCCC principle of "common but differentiated
