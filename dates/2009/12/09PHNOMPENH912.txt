¶1. (SBU) Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra arrived via 
private jet on December 13 for his second visit to Phnom Penh since 
his appointment as Economic Advisor to the Royal Government of 
Cambodia (RGC) (reftel).  His itinerary began with a visit to Prey 
Sar prison in Phnom Penh to meet the Thai engineer convicted of 
spying for passing the former Prime Minister's flight information to 
the Thai embassy during his last visit in November.  On December 11, 
King Norodom Sihamoni pardoned the engineer, Sivarak Chutipong, which 
Thaksin reportedly attributed to the "efforts of the Puea Thai 
party."  Minister of Information Khieu Kanharith added a small dig at 
the Thais when announcing the pardon, calling it a "humanitarian act" 
to free Sivarak, who had been "used" by a Thai government that 
refused to take responsibility for his actions.  Hun Sen marked 
Sivarak's release with a ceremony at his residence on December 14; 
Thaksin arrived at the PM's residence shortly after the ceremony for 
a private meeting. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Most observers believe that this latest visit is merely a 
continuation of Hun Sen and Thaksin using each other for mutual gain. 
 Maintaining a friendship with Thaksin allows Hun Sen to continue to 
goad Thai PM Abhsit Vejjajiva, with the added benefit of gaining an 
advisor in economic growth and trade, areas in which Cambodia is 
struggling.  Meanwhile, Thaksin is clearly taking advantage of his 
relationship with Hun Sen and Cambodia's close proximity to maintain 
his visibility, meet with his supporters, and assess the political 
climate in Thailand. 
 
¶3. (SBU) While the timing of the visit to coincide with Sivarak's 
release appears to be an attempt to credit Thaksin and the Puea Thai 
party with this intervention, Thaksin does seem to be making some 
effort to provide advice to officials on issues related to economic 
development.  Thanksin is reportedly scheduled to deliver a lecture 
at the Ministry of Economy and Finance December 15.  An official at 
the Ministry of Tourism confirmed that the RGC was organizing 
workshops on agriculture, tourism, trade, and investment for director 
of department-level government officials.  According to an official 
at the Ministry of Commerce, Thaksin plans to meet December 16 with 
the Minister of Commerce and officials at the Council for the 
Development of Cambodia to discuss improvements to the investment 
climate in Cambodia.
