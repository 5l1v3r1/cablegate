¶2. Discussion: These vehicles will be used for surveillance 
operations by the DNA.  The DNA is a highly effective unit of the 
National Police Anti-Drug Directorate Quito office.  For the 
security of undercover personnel and operations, it is necessary 
for the DNA Units to use nondescript vehicles that are locally 
common rather than the more conspicuous and distinctive 
U.S.-manufactures vehicles.  The requested vehicles are to replace 
vehicles that will be put up for auction. 
 
 
 
¶3. Recommendation:  For the reasons stated above, we recommend 
approval of this request for a source/origin waiver to permit 
acquisition of these project vehicles in Ecuador. 
 
 
 
¶4. Please expedite reply. Thank you.
