¶1. (U) SUMMARY AND COMMENT: According to Central Bank President 
Nelson Merentes' end of year projection, the Venezuelan economy 
contracted 2.9% in 2009.  The Central Bank (BCV) data indicated non 
oil exports fell to 2004 levels and petroleum income is also 
sharply down.  Trying to divert attention from the negative 
economic situation, GBRV spokesmen stressed how socialist policies 
have stabilized the economy while planned adjustments to the 
methodology of calculating GDP will provide a more complete 
assessment of the nation's advancement towards socialism in 2010. 
END SUMMARY AND COMMENT. 
 
 
 
BCV Estimates 
 
¶2.  (U) According to the BCV projection, the Venezuelan economy 
contracted 2.9% in 2009, implying a 4.6% contraction in the fourth 
quarter, its third consecutive quarterly contraction.  [NOTE: 
Official fourth quarter 2009 statistics will not be published for 
several months.  END NOTE.]  At the end of the third quarter, the 
BCV projected an annual GDP contraction of 2.2% (reftel B).  On 
national television the evening of December 30, President Hugo 
Chavez explained that "2009 was ending well, with the soul 
smiling," citing earlier forecasts that the world economic crisis 
and petroleum price crash would have impacted the local economy 
more severely. 
 
 
 
¶3.  (U) BCV estimates indicated that Venezuelan exports declined, 
with non oil exports falling to $3.3 billion.  Non oil export 
revenue is currently at 1997 levels and represents a 44% reduction 
from 2008.  The BCV estimated that oil production (barrels 
produced) fell by 6.1%.  In early December, OPEC estimated 
Venezuelan crude oil production at 2.3 million barrels a day (mbd), 
roughly the same level Venezuela achieved in 1990. (NOTE: GBRV 
claims oil production is around 3 mbd.  The BCV estimate does not 
attempt to reconcile these disparate figures. END NOTE.) Driven by 
a 32.7% reduction in petroleum prices, revenue from petroleum 
exports plummeted 35.3%, while export revenue in general fell 
35.9%.  Imports shrank from $49.5 billion in 2008 to $38.5 billion 
in 2009, a 22.2% difference.  The only positive advances in the 
economy included the construction sector (3.1%), communications 
(10.1%), and electricity generation and water utilities (4.6%). 
Unemployment closed the year at 8%.   According to Merentes' 
year-end report, nationalizations contributed to growth in the 
public sector and displaced the private sector as the main driver 
of the economy.  Public sector participation in GDP rose 30.3% with 
nationalizations of the cement industry, various banks and Sidor 
(Venezuela's largest steelmaker).  Government spending grew 2.1% 
even though, demand fell 1.8%, consumption dropped 1.8% and 
investment sank 7.6%. 
 
 
 
GBRV Response 
 
¶4.  (U) The BCV announced (again) that it will change the way it 
measures economic behavior in 2010 to present a more complete 
assessment of the country's transition to a socialist economy, 
echoing Chavez's remarks in November (reftels A and C).  These 
changes will allegedly include indicators to measure well-being as 
well as economic and social progress.  Press reports on December 31 
claim that Minister of Planning Jorge Giordani announced that the 
GBRV would reinforce socialist policies to stabilize the economy in 
¶2010.  Measures under consideration include public investment in 
agriculture, tourism and construction; refinancing internal debt; 
stabilizing the foreign exchange market; and increased capital 
expenditures.  Giordani maintained that subsidies and price 
controls would resolve inflationary problems (2009 inflation is 
estimated by independent economists at around 28%).
