Charge spoke with Costa Rican MFA Chief of Staff Elaine White to 
discuss Ref A talking points on December 1. White was very 
appreciative of the advance notification.  She said that she would 
convey the key points to Foreign Minister Bruno Stagno, who is 
currently in Spain attending the Ibero-American Summit, as well as 
others within the administration and would let us know if they had 
any feedback.
