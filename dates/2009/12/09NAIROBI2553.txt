Summary 
 
------- 
 
 
 
¶1. (SBU) Post continues to press the regional government of 
Puntland to release Voice of America (VOA) Somali Service reporter 
Mohamed Yasin Isaq, who was detained on December 21 (reftel) and 
remains in custody, with no charges filed against him.  The Somalia 
Unit has spoken directly with Puntland President "Faroole," 
transmitted a letter from the Ambassador demanding Isaq's release, 
issued a local press release on the subject, and conducted an 
interview with VOA Somali Service.  We also remain engaged through 
all possible channels with contacts in Puntland.  We spoke directly 
with Isaq on December 30, and he indicated he was being treated 
adequately.  End summary.

¶2. (SBU) Voice of America (VOA) Somali Service reporter Mohamed 
Yasin Isaq has been detained in Puntland since his December 21 
arrest (reftel).  Puntland authorities have yet to file charges 
against him, and sources indicate Puntland President "Faroole" is 
interested in keeping Isaq in detention - and off the radio - for 
an indefinite period.  In addition to the December 22 conversation 
with "Faroole" reported in reftel, Ambassador Ranneberger sent a 
letter (forwarded to AF) directly to "Faroole" on December 29.  In 
addition, the Counselor for Somalia Affairs conducted a 
widely-covered interview with VOA Somali Service on December 28, 
which VOA followed with a press release reiterating the Counselor's 
assertion that Isaq should be released immediately.  Post also 
issued a press release on the subject to Somali media (also 
forwarded to AF) on December 23.  To date, we have had no public or 
private response from "Faroole." 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post spoke directly with Isaq, via a phone connection with 
one of the Puntland authorities at the site of his detention, on 
the morning of December 30.  Isaq told us he was being treated 
adequately, with sufficient food and water.  He said he would 
likely be moved to a police station in Bossaso shortly, following a 
pattern of relocations since his December 21 arrest.  Isaq thanked 
the U.S. government for our efforts to secure his release. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post remains engaged with a variety of official contacts 
in Puntland, urging them to release Isaq and allow him to continue 
his work as a journalist.  We also plan to continue our media 
engagements on this subject, particularly on other Puntland-based 
media outlets.
