SUBJECT: SAO PAULO KEY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, DECEMBER 1-15, 2009 
 
¶1. (U) SUMMARY: This cable covers the period of December 1-15, 
¶2009.  It highlights economic, energy and science and technology 
developments in the Sao Paulo Consular District not covered by 
broader reporting. Some significant developments during the period 
were: Brazil's bullet train project, results of Brazil's first wind 
power auction, reactions to next year's economic stimulus measures, 
and the economic impact of the flooding in Sao Paulo. END SUMMARY.

Bullet Train Unlikely by the 2014 World Cup 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------------ 
 
 
 
¶2. (U) Sao Paulo leaders announced December 8 that the construction 
of a bullet train from Campinas to Sao Paulo and on to Rio de 
Janeiro will not be completed by the time of the World Cup in 2014. 
The project is estimated to cost around $20 billion dollars, of 
which about $12 billion, or 60 percent, is expected to be funded by 
Brazil's National Development Bank (BNDES) and 30 percent, or about 
$6 billion, by the Brazilian government. The GOB intends to create 
a new government-owned company, which will research and control the 
technology associated with the bullet train.  The GOB estimates 
that about 7 million passengers will travel between Sao Paulo and 
Rio via the bullet train annually once complete.  Travel time 
between Sao Paulo and Rio will fall from approximately five hours 
to two.  The project is set to start in the first quarter of next 
year, and is expected to be completed by the end of 2015--too late 
for the World Cup but ready in time for the Rio Olympics in 2016.

2010 Economic Stimulus Measures Generate Divided Reactions 
 
--------------------------------------------- -------------- 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Following the December 9 announcement by Finance Minister 
Mantega of additional fiscal stimulus measures to bolster the 
Brazilian economy, private sector representatives in Sao Paulo have 
responded with mixed sentiments.  The package, likely to amount to 
more than $118 billion in 2010, includes a new line of credit to 
BNDES worth $47 billion to finance investments in infrastructure, 
capital goods and exports, among other categories.  Corporate 
sector contacts have reacted enthusiastically, particularly 
following the announcement December 10 of slower than expected 
economic growth figures for the third quarter of 2009.  Paulo 
Godoy, president of Abdib (Brazilian Association of 
Infrastructure), for instance, highlighted that the measures 
support the demand for long-term loans.  However, many analysts, 
such as Alexandre Schwartsman, chief economist at Santander, 
expressed growing concern about the impact of successive public 
stimulus packages on the fiscal accounts and monetary policy.

Economic Impact of the Flooding in Sao Paulo 
 
--------------------------------------------- 
 
 
 
¶4. (U) Floods in the city of Sao Paulo December 8-9 generated 
economic losses and brought traffic on key cross-city highways to a 
standstill as the adjacent Tiete and Pinheiros rivers broke their 
 
banks.  The weather service reported it was the heaviest 24-hour 
period of rainfall in Sao Paulo this year, dumping half of its 
total average December precipitation in one night.  The flooding 
generated significant economic losses, primarily to small and 
medium size businesses.  Ceagesp, a warehouse company, lost 
approximately $8.8 million in inventory while small establishments 
in the municipal market reported a drop in sales of 60 percent 
following the rains and Sao Paulo's commercial association reported 
a 12 percent decline in commercial transactions in the city.  Sao 
Paulo Mayor Gilberto Kassab publicly denied repeated accusations 
that lack of investment in water canalization was to blame and has 
ordered a review of city emergency services to improve the response 
to future flooding.
