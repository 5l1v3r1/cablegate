REFTEL: REQUEST #6110074; DATED 11/10/2009 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a pre-license check to determine the legitimacy 
and reliability of the end-user, Proton LLC, Moscow, Russia.  The 
organization is listed on BIS license application D422663 as the 
ultimate consignee of one vertical machining center with 20QX16QX14 
travels (X,Y,Z) with a 2-axis trunnion table TR110, capable of 
5-axis simultaneous machining.  This item is controlled for national 
security, nuclear nonproliferation and anti-terrorism reasons under 
ECCN 2B001.  The licensee is Haas Automation Inc., 2800 Sturgis 
Road, Oxnard, CA 93030. 
 
¶3. On December 3, 2009, Commercial Attach Ilona Shtrom and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested pre-license check at the 
offices of Proton LLC., Pushkina st., 23A, Sobinka, Vladimir Region, 
Russia.  The export control team met with Dmitry Ponomarenko, 
General Director, EMG.  EMG is a small business and is ProtonQs 
parent company. Founded in 2003, Proton employs approximately 50 
individuals.  EMG, the parent company, employs approximately 400. 
EMG includes a variety of other organizations within its structure 
including a company called QModelQ and QMethodQ.  All companies work 
in electro-technical sector. 
 
¶4. ProtonQs customers include mostly oil/gas companies as the 
company produces the vacuums utilized in pumping oil out of the 
ground.  Proton exports to some countries of the former Soviet Union 
(e.g. Kazakhstan), as well as India.  The equipment the company 
wishes to purchase from Haas will be utilized to improve efficiency 
and produce more components with fewer machine operators.  Proton is 
located in an industrial area and appeared to be fully surrounded by 
a security gate.  Mr. Ponomarenko indicated security is available 
24/7 because, otherwise, it would not be safe to leave such 
expensive equipment.  The export control team was given a brief tour 
of the building which will house the Haas equipment.  The facility 
 
appeared new and was not yet in operation pending receipt of the 
equipment.  When the export control team explained the purpose of 
the visit, Mr. Ponomarenko stated he has received Haas equipment in 
the past and didnQt understand the reason for our visit now. 
Additionally, he stated he is aware that several former defense 
related organizations have ordered and already received the same 
equipment and were never contacted for a PLC (he noted one such 
organization located in Novosibirsk). Mr. Ponomarenko stated he 
understands the equipment may not be re-exported and has plans to 
make additional purchases from Haas in the future. 
 
¶5. Recommendations: Post recommends Proton LLC, Sobinka, Vladimir 
Region, Russia, as a reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. origin 
commodities.
