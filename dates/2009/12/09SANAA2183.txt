SUBJECT: YEMEN: RESPONDING TO ARAB LEAGUE BOYCOTT REPORTING 
REQUIREMENTS 
 
REF: SECSTATE 120272 
 
In response to REFTEL request, post has gathered the 
following information on current Arab League Boycott (ALB) 
practices in Yemen: 
 
- The ROYG continues to enforce the primary aspect of the 
ALB, namely, prohibiting the importation of Israeli-origin 
goods and services into Yemen.  The ROYG does not enforce the 
secondary and tertiary aspects of the boycott and does not 
require participation in or participation with any other 
international boycotts. 
 
- The ROYG does not request that U.S. firms comply with 
boycott requirements. 
 
- The ROYG's boycott practices have a minimal impact on U.S. 
businesses, as the practices are not very well enforced. 
 
- The ROYG is implementing a 1995 governmental decision to 
renounce observance of the secondary and tertiary aspects of 
the boycott. 
 
- The ROYG does not maintain an ALB office.  Yemen 
participates in the annual meeting of the Central Boycott 
Office (CBO) in Damascus. 
 
- The ROYG has not made any concrete efforts to stop 
enforcing the primary aspect of the ALB, and still actively 
supports it. 
 
- On November 24, EconOff met with Mojeeb Mohammed Othman, 
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) official in charge of 
Arab League affairs in the MFA's Arab Countries Department. 
Othman insisted that Yemen's enforcement of the primary 
aspect of the ALB is related to political reasons and cited 
the Arab-Israeli conflict as a root cause.  When pressed by 
EconOff about the extent of the enforcement, Othman admitted 
that enforcement is not complete and said that products still 
get into Yemen.
