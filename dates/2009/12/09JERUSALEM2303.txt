SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (12/22): Prisoner exchange deal 
still up in the air 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The three dailies report that the Israeli cabinet will continue 
discussions today regarding the prisoner exchange deal. Ma'an and Al 
Jazeera report that the Israeli cabinet will announce its decision 
later today. It is reported that Hamas officials expect to have the 
deal concluded before the end of the year. 
 
Independent daily Al-Quds' lead headline highlights Israeli Prime 
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's insistence on deporting some of the 
prisoners to Gaza or outside the country. Independent daily Al-Ayyam 
reports that Hamas officials refuse to deport any of the released 
prisoners. 
 
Palestinian Authority (PA) official daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front 
pages an article citing Israeli daily Yediot Ahronot publishing the 
names of nine prisoners that Hamas wants released but Israel refuses 
to approve. 
 
Independent news outlet Ma'an reports that the Palestinian 
Liberation Organization (PLO) Central Council appointed Minister of 
Prisoners Issa Qareqe to launch an investigation into the reported 
organ theft of deceased Palestinians by Israeli officials in the 
1990s. 
 
Al-Ayyam reports that settlers attacked and threw stones at a 
Palestinian home in Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem last night. PA 
presidency representative Rafiq Al-Husseini visited the family and 
condemned the attack. 
 
Citing DPA, Al-Quds reports that PLO Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat 
noted that Egyptian Chief Intelligence Omar Suleiman asked Israeli 
decision makers to take decisive measures to stop settlement 
activity in order to pursue peace negotiations with the 
Palestinians. 
 
------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
Al-Quds runs an editorial under the title "We Need an International 
Investigation After the Israeli Official Admission of Organ Theft" 
calling for an international committee to look into the issue, 
punish officials responsible for the theft, and enact measures to 
prevent such incidents from happening in future. The writer 
questions whether the international community will do this or 
continue to have double standards in regards to its bias against 
Palestinians.
