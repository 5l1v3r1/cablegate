SUBJECT: EXTRANCHECK: PRE-LICENSE CHECK: MASHCOMPLECS FAKEL LTD., 
MOSCOW, RUSSIA, LICENSE NO.D427375 
 
REFTEL: REQUEST #6110082; DATED 11/24/2009 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a pre-license check to determine the legitimacy 
and reliability of the end-user, Mashcomplecs Fakel Ltd., Moscow, 
Russia.  The organization is listed on BIS license application 
D427375 as the ultimate consignee of one explorer 600KHZ Doppler 
velocity log.  This item is controlled for national security reasons 
under ECCN 6A001.  The licensee is Teledyne RD Instruments, 14020 
Stowe Dr., Poway, CA 92064. 
 
¶3. On December 22, 2009, Commercial Attach Nancy Luther and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested pre-license check at the 
offices of Mashcomplecs Fakel Ltd., 37/2, Prospect Vernadskogo, 
Moscow, Russia.  The export control team met with Vyacheslav Shutko, 
Director of Purchasing.  The small company was founded in March 2009 
(Registration Certificate verified).  The company has 12 permanent 
employees, including two engineers, and hires other specialists as 
needed on a project basis.  The Owner and General Manager is Galina 
Schukina.  The company sources and services machines and equipment 
for government organizations and private companies.  According to 
Shutko, who was very forthcoming with information, since the 
companyQs start up in March, they have had 20 contracts involving 45 
transactions of machinery and parts. 
 
¶4. Mashcomplecs Fakel has assurances (via the Moscow City 
Government) that upon purchase of this equipment, it will be 
selected to take part in a tender, a construction project in 
preparation for the upcoming 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi.  The 
Teledyne RD Instruments Explorer 600KHZ Doppler velocity log will be 
used for measuring the direction and speed of water currents.  The 
purpose of collecting the data is to assure that the Black Sea 
waters are not damaged by the waste water from the construction 
project, which will be, after filtration, dumped into the sea.  The 
equipment, which will be housed in Moscow at a dedicated secure 
warehouse with 24 hour guard (Luther and Shipitsina visited), will 
be taken to Sochi by a team of engineers and security specialists. 
When not in use in Sochi, the device will be stored at a secure 
warehouse which is to be determined.  The Purchasing Manager 
explained that the company does not yet have a contract to provide 
the proposed services, since the tender has not yet been announced. 
 
¶5. Recommendations: Post recommends Mashcomplecs Fakel Ltd., Moscow, 
Russia, as a reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. origin 
commodities.  However, given that the company was not yet able to 
provide a contract, it is recommended that a requirement for 
post-shipment verification be added to the conditions of the 
license.
