MASSIVE REBEL RETURN 
-------------------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) MINURCAT SRSG Victor Angelo told Ambassador 
September 3 that he could confirm that as many as 1,500 
former Chad rebels crossed back into Chad from Sudan in the 
past few days. 
 
------------------------ 
SOUBIANE AND HASSABALLAH 
------------------------ 
 
¶2.  (SBU)  Angelo said that the ex-rebels were from Ahmat 
Soubiane's FSR and Adouma Hassaballah's UFDD-Fundamental 
formations.  Soubiane's fighters are primarily ethnic Arabs; 
Hassaballah's group is composed of Ouaddaians, easterners who 
include ethnic Arabs as well as other tribes.

COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  If the SRSG's information is correct, this looks 
to be the biggest single defection from the rebel ranks since 
Mahamat Nour and his FUC fighters (heavily Tama ethnic group) 
returned to Chad in 2006.  This massive defection reduces the 
strength of the rebellion militarily and isolates the 
"hardliners" like Timane Erdimi and Mahamat Nouri 
politically, while underlining the latter's dependence on 
Sudanese sponsorship and largesse. 
 
¶4.  (SBU)  This also validates the continued efficacy of the 
GOC's "intra-Chadian" diplomatic strategy (See Refs B and C). 
Now the trick for the GOC will be to get these former rebel 
chiefs usefully and permanently engaged in Chad, as for 
example the Deby regime has so far been able to do with 
current Army Chief of Staff Al-Djineddi, and but was unable 
to sustain with Mahamat Nour, whose tour of duty as Defense 
Minister (March-December 2007) ended unhappily.  END COMMENT. 
 
¶5.  (U) Minimize considered.
