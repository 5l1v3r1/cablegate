In Today's Papers 
 
'Security Summit' on Kurdish Democratic Initiative 
Media outlets report Prime Minister Erdogan came together Thursday 
with army chief General Ilker Basbug, force commanders and the 
related cabinet ministers at a "security summit" in connection with 
the government's Kurdish democratic initiative.  Interior Minister 
Besir Atalay briefed the meeting on the steps taken by the 
government regarding the initiative.  A statement released at the 
end of the meeting said internal and external security measures and 
anti-terror policies to be pursued in the new period were reviewed. 
Islamist-oriented Zaman says the meeting focused on legal reforms 
that will be raised in the parliament during the autumn session. 
 
Armenian Opposition Asks for Referendum on Diplomatic Ties With 
Turkey 
Yeni Safak, Zaman, Vatan, Sabah, Milliyet, Hurriyet, and others: 
Islamist oriented Yeni Safak and main stream Sabah report that 
Armenian opposition party The Heritage launched a campaign for 
holding a referendum on the two protocols agreed on between Turkey 
and Armenia for normalization of bilateral relations.  Sabah also 
reports that European Armenian Federation, which is considered as 
Armenian Diaspora in Europe, was disturbed by recent normalization 
initiative between Turkey and Armenia.  Releasing a statement, the 
federation said "Turkey is imposing pre-conditions which are 
violating the basic principles of the international law."  Islamist 
oriented Zaman and mainstream Milliyet report that Baku, once again, 
reminded Turkey to keep its promise regarding the border opening 
with Armenia not to realize unless Armenian occupation ends in Upper 
Karabakh. 
 
Editorial Debate on Government's Armenia and Kurdish Initiatives 
 
Mehmet Yilmaz wrote in mainstream Hurriyet: "It was very wrong from 
the beginning to attach bilateral relations with Armenia to the 
relationship with a third country, i.e. Azerbaijan.  All previous 
governments continued this mistake just like the current one. 
Turkey's opposition parties should feel responsible to offer a 
solution instead of standing against the initiative by sticking on 
the mistaken approach." 
 
Sami Kohen wrote in mainstream Milliyet: "There cannot be an 
overnight settlement to the long standing Karabakh problem.  However 
it is possible and likely that after successful effort from the 
Minsk Group, Armenian forces may be withdrawing from the seven areas 
surrounding Karabakh.  Any progress in the Turkish-Armenian ties 
will be beneficial for Azerbaijan as well." 
 
Okay Gonensin wrote in mainstream Vatan: "There is always an ongoing 
phobia in Turkey.  Regardless of any fundamental initiative, Kurdish 
problem or relations with Armenian, some in Turkey always come up 
with 'foreign powers are imposing their terms' phobia. 
Unfortunately, this has been the case before and it is now too." 
 
Ferai Tinc wrote in mainstream Hurriyet: "After the announcement of 
the normalization process with Armenia, there is a growingly upset 
voice coming from the Diaspora.  This clearly indicates that the 
initiative is a very right thing to do and government should not 
hesitate to proceed." 
 
Ali Bayramoglu wrote in Islamist oriented Yeni Safak: "A successful 
outcome of the Kurdish initiative requires Kurdish people's support, 
and that's what the government's plan already has.  The efforts from 
some pro-Kurdish groups, such as DTP should not be disappointing or 
discouraging.  They are still under the influence of PKK's 
imprisoned leader and stick with his thinking.  However, Kurds in 
Turkey are supportive of the approach and this is what Ankara has to 
watch for." 
 
Freedom for the Terrorists Coming Down the Mountains and 11 Years 
Prison Sentence for Throwing Stones to Police (Vatan) 
 
ANKARA 00001300  002 OF 003 
 
 
Mainstreams Vatan, Sabah, Milliyet and Hurriyet report that two 
people who threw stones to the police in Sirnak, Cizre on October 18 
in order to protest Prime Minister Erdogan's visit to Diyarbakir, 
were sentenced to 11 year in prison each.  Vatan reminds TGS 
statement of August 26 saying that 12 PKK terrorists were freed 
during the month of July who were surrendered to security forces. 
 
First Female Minister After 30 Years. (Sabah)  Both Female and a 
Terrorist in the Cabinet. (Milliyet) 
Media emphasize Iran's parliament approved all but three of 21 
nominees for the cabinet including the first female minister since 
the 1979 revolution.  Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak, writes in 
"Female Minister After 30 Years," that "the cabinet will have its 
first female minister Vahid Dastjerdi overseeing health who defended 
gender discrimination at hospitals and other health institutes." 
Mainstream Milliyet carries the headline, "Both A Female and A 
Terrorist in New Iranian Government" and notes, "While Dastjerdi 
becomes the first female minister, Ahmad Vahidi, who is wanted by 
Interpol on charges that he helped organize the bombing of a Jewish 
center in Argentina, is approved as the defense minister." 
Mainstream Hurriyet headlines, "Terrorism Suspect Minister," and 
notes, "speaking to AFP after he was approved, Vahidi said that his 
assignment was a slap to Israel." 
 
Kaidanow Visits Ankara 
US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia, 
Ambassador Tina Kaidanow, visited the Turkish Foreign Ministry (MFA) 
on Thursday.  Kaidanow met with Deputy Undersecretaries Unal Cevikoz 
and Haydar Berk.  In "Bryza's Successor Discusses with MFA Armenia 
and Cyprus," mass appeal Aksam says Ankara has asked Kaidanow to do 
her best for the resolution of the Karabakh question.  Kaidanow said 
the US would continue encouraging the sides in Cyprus to see that 
the peace process in the divided island will not be disrupted, 
reports Aksam. 
 
Water Summit: Turkey-Iraq-Syria 
Vatan reports on the Sept. 3 water summit in Ankara with Syrian and 
Iraqi delegations.  Iraq and Syria are asking for more water from 
rivers which are shared by three countries.  In rejecting Iraqi 
pleas for increased water supply, Turkish Environment Minister 
Eroglu emphasized that the "Ataturk Dam in the southeast was emptied 
in order to provide water for neighbors."   The summit ended, 
however, with a signed protocol for continued water supply.
