SUMMARY 
------- 

¶1. (SBU) During the September 24 Property Working Group 
meeting, Government of Nicaragua (GON) promised better transparency 
on U.S. claims that have exhausted their appeals in the 
administrative process.  Econoff pressed officials for more 
information on U.S. claims that were allegedly not filed with the 
National Confiscations Review Commission.  GON officials asserted 
that the case of U.S. citizen Juan Barreto, whose 28 properties are 
under the control of the Nicaraguan Army, is close to resolution 
pending receipt of one document.  Econoff reminded officials that 
the Embassy advocates on behalf of all U.S. citizen property cases 
regardless of whether they fall under Section 527 of the Foreign 
Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1994 and 1995.  We will 
work with government officials to address Attorney General Hernan 
Estrada's concerns regarding some Section 527 claims, but this 
cooperation requires more transparency on how the government 
determines settlement offers. 
 
CLAIMS THAT HAVE EXHAUSTED APPEALS 
---------------------------------- 

¶2. (SBU) On September 24, Econoff held the monthly Property Working 
Group meeting with Ruth Zapata, Head of the Office of Assessment and 
Quantification (OCI); Jeanette Garcia, President of the National 
Confiscations Review Commission (CNRC); Magally Bravo, the Attorney 
General4s Executive Coordinator for Property Issues; Alfonso 
Solorzano, CNRC member; and Rebeca Zuniga, Coordinator of the Office 
of U.S. Citizen Claims.  Econoff asked GON officials for more 
information on the status of the list of 19 claimants who could no 
longer pursue their claims through the administrative process.  He 
explained that several claimants had not received notification that 
they had exhausted their administrative appeals, or that the 
government had published notice that their claims were resolved in 
the Official Gazette and deposited compensation in escrow (Ref A). 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Zuniga responded that she would meet with U.S. claimants to 
discuss their claims and settlement offers.  Econoff urged her to 
provide clear, detailed explanations,  as she did in the case of 
U.S. citizen Domingo Calero (Ref B).  He stated that the lack of 
transparency in the settlement process undermines our joint efforts 
to work with claimants to advance their claims. 

UPDATE ON ADMINISTRATIVE DISMISSALS 
----------------------------------- 

¶4. (SBU) Econoff provided an update on the revised list of 24 U.S. 
claimants whose claims the GON dismissed for administrative reasons; 
some lack of proof of ownership and/or confiscation of the property 
in question, and other claims were never filed with the CNRC (Ref 
C).  He explained that claimants were reviewing their files to find 
documents that demonstrated the legitimacy of their claims.  He 
noted that on September 21 the Ambassador wrote to Attorney General 
Estrada to provide him information that the Embassy Property Office 
had on file for each claim.  Econoff asked GON officials to provide 
more time as claimants continue searching for their documents. 
 
 
STATUS OF THE BARRETO CASE 
-------------------------- 

¶5. (SBU) Econoff raised the case of U.S. citizen Juan Barreto, whose 
28 properties are under control of the Nicaraguan Army (Ref D). 
Zuniga said the only document pending was the Barreto family's 
corporate charter.  She underscored that the GON was eager to 
resolve this case. 
 
DEFENDING ALL U.S. CITIZEN PROPERTY RIGHTS 
------------------------------------------ 

¶6. (SBU) Solorzano stated that the GON is working only on Section 
527 waiver claims and asked the Embassy not to raise non-waiver 
cases.  Garcia added that the USG and GON should focus our efforts 
on these waiver claims to maximize our time during the working group 
meetings.  Econoff reminded them that the Embassy advocates on 
behalf of all U.S. citizen property claims regardless whether they 
fall under Section 527.  He emphasized that all U.S. claimants 
should be afforded equal due process to defend their property 
rights. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 

¶7. (SBU) GON officials are under pressure from Attorney General 
Estrada to pursue only his agenda for U.S. citizen claims during our 
monthly working group meetings.  We told officials that we will work 
with them to address Estrada's concerns for some claims, as long as 
there is more transparency on how the government determines 
settlement offers.  So far, we sense that Estrada is attempting to 
bully us and U.S. claimants to accept settlement offers without 
negotiation.
