SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: PRE-LICENSE END-USE CHECK 
ON LICENSE 050188541 
 
REF: YEKATERINBURG 39 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraph 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a pre-license check on license 050188541 for the export of 
bullet tips to Russia.  Post is requested to complete this 
Blue Lantern check within 30 days.  Lack of response to a 
Blue Lantern check will affect pending and future licenses 
involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request:  A previous Blue Lantern found that 
this end-user imports bullets on behalf of other individuals 
in Russia (REFTEL).  The previous license was for 24,000 
reloading bullets and has not yet been exhausted.  This 
license is for 54,000 bullet tips.  This request is to get 
specific details on the ultimate end-use of these bullet tips. 
 
¶4. Action Request: Post is requested to contact Vasiliy 
Volovod to obtain answers to the questions below.  Post is 
also requested to inquire with appropriate Russian officials 
to determine if Vasiliy Volovod is authorized to provide 
and/or sell ammunition components to individuals in Russia 
(NOTE: Another site visit is not/not required). 
 
(To Vasiliy Volovod) 
 
--According to the last Blue Lantern check, you import 
bullets for yourself and your friends.  Please provide a list 
of end-users of this ammunition. 
 
--In order to verify the personal use of these bullet tips, 
please provide the makes and models of the firearms with 
which you intend to use these bullets. 
 
--Why are you seeking 54,000 bullets tips on this license if 
the previous license is yet to be exhausted? 
 
--You stated that, on average, you use 300-400 rounds of 
ammunition per month.  On average, how many rounds of 
ammunition does each of your friends use per month? 
Collectively, how many rounds of ammunition do you and your 
friends use per month? 
 
--Given this volume of ammunition, are you selling ammunition 
commercially? 
 
--Is all the ammunition to be used domestically in Russia for 
sport shooting/hunting?  Is any being re-exported?  Are you 
aware of prohibition against unauthorized re-export of 
US-origin defense articles? 
 
(To appropriate Russian authorities) 
 
--Is Vasiliy Volovod authorized to provide ammunition and/or 
ammunition components to other individuals in Russia? 
 
In its reply, Post may also comment on any other information 
pertinent to these transactions such as security of 
facilities, end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
