¶1.  CHINA'S SECURITY 
 
"Hu Jintao explained China's new security concepts at the UN General 
Assembly" 
 
The Shanghai-based Shanghai Media Group (SMG) publication, China 
Business News (Diyi Caijing)(09/25)(pg A2): "Wang Yizhou, a 
professor at Beijing University's Institute of International 
Relations, said that China is currently facing more and more 
non-traditional security threats, such as terrorism, religious 
extremism and ethnic separatism; financial risks; and new infectious 
diseases, like SARS, H1N1, and other influenza.  The increasing 
importance of non-traditional security issues highlights the close 
connection between China's economic development and various economic 
security issues, including energy, environment, and information 
security.  China's call for 'new security concepts' is due to the 
current challenges it faces and the nature of these non-traditional 
security threats.  Bilateral channels have usually been used to 
address traditional security issues; however, in response to new 
security threats, we need to strengthen our multilateral 
cooperation." 
 
¶2.  G20 SUMMIT 
 
"'Exit strategy' difficult to implement; 'de-globalization' 
threatens trade stability" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(09/25)(pg 2): 
"Before the G20 summit, Obama laid out a proposal to establish a 
'sustainable and balanced growth framework,' the main focus of which 
was to expand domestic demand in surplus countries, and a proposal 
to establish mechanisms to review national economic policies.  If we 
connect his proposals to the recent Sino-U.S. tire trade dispute, we 
can conclude that the 'cooperation honeymoon' between countries 
during this crisis has ended.  It seems that the current round of 
the crisis has not only triggered global de-leverage and 
de-inventory, but also 'de-globalization.'  The worst case 
post-recovery scenario for China would be for the global economy to 
remain unbalanced and there to be increasingly severe protectionism, 
both of which would pose a serious challenge to China's monetary 
policy.  As connected economies, it is critical that the U.S. and 
China actively work to fix the post-financial crisis unbalanced 
economic structure.  Now that the economic model of the 1980s has 
been destroyed, it will be a long process to build the foundation 
for a new economic model.  Therefore, the U.S. and China must make 
common effort to construct a buffer zone for economic structural 
adjustment.  The Chinese central bank's major policy in the future 
should be stabilizing the suddenly steep credit rates, which 
requires stable external demand." 
 
¶3.  GLOBAL ECONOMY 
 
"China should be wary of any sudden change to the global economic 
situation" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(09/25)(pg 14): "China's economic recovery 
will not be easy or fast.  China will undergo a significant economic 
transition.  No one can predict when the recovery turning point will 
be, but everyone knows that while the storm is over the clouds still 
remain.  It has become even harder for G20 countries to reach common 
views and take consistent action.  For China, the period of economic 
development based solely on exports has passed.  China needs to 
explore new markets and find new sources of economic growth.  The 
negative influence of the global financial crisis combined with the 
challenges of economic transition has put China through a very 
difficult time.  At this point, China's goal should not be trying to 
be the first to recover, but rather should be finding a path to 
sustainable development. "
