¶1. (U)  Like the United States, Canada is a nation of 
immigrants.  Immigrants make up twenty percent of the overall 
population in Canada, according to the most recent census 
data (2006).  The largest Diaspora in Canada is from the 
United Kingdom (579,620) followed by China (466,940), India 
(443,690), the Philippines (303,195), Italy (296,850), U.S. 
(250,535), and Hong Kong SAR (215,430).  Sri Lankans, 
Jamaicans, Pakistanis, Iranians, and Vietnamese also make up 
large immigrant populations of around 100,000 people each. 
Since 2001, the largest amount of immigrants have come from 
China (155,105), India (129,140), the Philippines (77,880), 
Pakistan (57,630), and the U.S. (38,770), with other large 
communities from Iran (27,600), Colombia (25,305), Sri Lanka 
(22,305), Mexico (16,520), Afghanistan (16,240), Algeria 
(16,235), and Lebanon (11,355).  Canada accepts about 250,000 
immigrants each year, and the "wooing of new Canadians" is 
now an important part of Canadian politics (ref e).  Toronto 
is the most diverse city in Canada, with 47% of residents 
foreign-born (ref l). 
 
¶2. (U)  The most publicly active Diaspora communities in 
Canada during 2008 and 2009 have been Iranians and Sri 
Lankans.  Supporters of the Tamil Tigers have engaged in 
public protests throughout Canada to generate public 
awareness for their cause (refs i, j, and k).  Iranians came 
out in force during the disputed elections in their homeland 
(ref d).
