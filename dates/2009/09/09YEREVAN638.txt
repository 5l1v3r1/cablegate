TURKEY-ARMENIA DEAL, DOWNPLAYS EARLY BREAKTHROUGH ON N-K 
 
(SBU) Sensitive but unclassifi)VUWN0`gic 
importance of Armenia's relationship with Russia, lauded 
constructive role of the U.S. in 
Armenia-Turkey rapprochement, and downplayed the possibility 
for a near-term 
resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.  END SUMMARY. 
 
RUSSIAN-ARMENIAN "STRATEGIC" PARTNERSHIP 
 
¶2.  Sargsian opened his remarks with a reference to the 
ongoing importance of the 
Armenian-Russian strategic partnership, which he said is 
based on economic cooperation, joint 
participation in the Collective Security Treaty Organization 
(CSTO), and the large 
Armenian diaspora in Russia.  Sargsian also highlighted the 
help Armenia received from Russia 
in the form of a $500 million USD loan that helped to 
mitigate the effects of the economic 
crisis. 
 
U.S.- ARMENIA RELATIONS 
 
¶3.  Sargsian painted a positive picture of the bilateral 
relationship with the U.S., citing 
economic, security, and democracy projects as areas of 
continued close cooperation.  Sargsian 
emphasized the important role played by the Armenian Diaspora 
in ensuring that the U.S. 
Congress continued to support the country with development 
assistance.  Sargsian also made 
positive remarks about the U.S. Government's constructive 
involvement in Armenia-Turkey 
rapprochement and dismissed critics' claims that the talks 
had prevented the U.S. President 
from publicly acknowledging the Armenian Genocide. 
 
NAGORNO-KARABAKH PEACE PROCESS 
 
¶4.  Sargsian went to lengths to assure the MFA and his wider 
audience that his government was 
conducting all negotiations on the N-K peace process in a 
transparent and open manner. 
Rather defensively, Sargsian stated that his government had 
not failed to inform 
the public on its intentions vis-a-vis the Madrid Principles, 
and that publication of the 
principles proved that he had never tried to mislead the 
public.  He acknowledged that the 
Madrid Principles had certain weak points, but pointed out 
that the central issue of N-K 
self-determination was preserved.  Taking a stab at the 
political opposition, Sargsian noted 
that N-K's final status was a "sacred issue", and described 
the efforts of those who would 
stop the process as nothing more than "petty profiteering". 
 
¶5.  Sargsian downplayed the possibility of a short-term 
breakthrough on N-K, assuring his 
listeners that the N-K peace process was a lengthy one that 
would require "more than a 
matter of days, weeks, or even months" to resolve.  Sargsian 
stated that current negotiations 
only covered the basic principles of a settlement.  Agreement 
on these basic principles would be followed by further 
negotiation on complex individual principles.  During the 
negotiation process, Sargsian noted, it was Armenia's 
priority to ensure N-K's security 
while being its advocate to the international community. 
 
NORMALIZING TURKISH-ARMENIAN RELATIONS 
 
¶6.  Sargsian referred to the Armenia-Turkey joint-statement 
of August 31 as a sign of the 
success of his decision to invite the Turkish President to 
Armenia the previous 
year, and his policy to pursue normalized relations.  He 
stated that the protocols on the 
establishment of diplomatic relations and development of 
 
YEREVAN 00000638  002 OF 002 
 
 
bilateral relations demonstrated 
that Armenia's interests would be protected in three vital 
ways: 
 
      1) Negotiations with Turkey and agreement on 
establishing relations have no 
preconditions related to the peaceful settlement of N-K; 
      2) Historical issues related to the Genocide will not 
be discussed by historians but 
rather within one of the subcommissions of the 
intergovernmental commission; and 
      3) A hearty and vigorous public debate within Armenia 
will precede the signing of these 
important agreements. 
 
¶7.  Sargsian closed his speech with a reminder to senior 
diplomats about the importance of 
their work for Armenia's national security.  Sargsian also 
noted that since becoming president 
he had made 10 ambassadorial appointments, of which only two 
had been political appointees. 
He pointed to this as a sign of his commitment to the 
Armenian Dipcorps and his trust in 
their professional judgment.
