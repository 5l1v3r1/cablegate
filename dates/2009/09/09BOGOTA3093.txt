SUMMARY 
 
------- 
 
 
 
¶1. (C/NF) Colombia and Ecuador announced on September 24 that they 
had begun the process of re-establishing diplomatic relations, 
which Ecuador severed in March 2008 after a Colombian military raid 
against a Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) camp in 
Ecuadorian territory.  The two sides released an 11-point outline 
of the terms of the process, beginning with the naming of Charges 
d'Affaires in October.  The communique also included a Colombian 
pledge to refrain from military action inside Ecuador, an 
Ecuadorian promise to crack down on illegal armed groups in its 
territory, bilateral efforts to improve the situation of Colombian 
refugees in Ecuador, and initiatives to increase communication and 
coordination between authorities on both sides of the border.  The 
agreement deferred particularly thorny topics or set them up for 
mediation through the Carter Center or Organization of American 
States (OAS).  Colombian officials credit Ecuadorian President 
Rafael Correa's constructive attitude in recent Union of South 
American Nations (UNASUR) meetings, likely motivated by the need to 
diplomatically address a range of bilateral issues.  Colombia 
appears to be looking at the thaw as a way to drive a wedge between 
Ecuador and Venezuela and improve commerce with Ecuador as trade 
with Venezuela worsens, but it will take time for Colombia and 
Ecuador to overcome remaining differences.  End Summary. 
 
 
RAPPROCHEMENT AFTER 18 MONTH BREAK 
 
---------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Colombian Foreign Minister Jaime Bermudez and Ecuadorian 
Foreign Minister Fander Falconi announced on September 24 that 
their countries had begun the process of re-establishing diplomaticQelati 
ons.  (NOTE: Ecuador broke diplomatic relations with Colombia 
in March 2008 after a Colombian military strike against FARC 
Commander Raul Reyes' camp just across the border in Ecuador. End 
Note.)  The ministers made the announcement in New York after what 
Colombian press characterized as four days of intense negotiations 
on the margins of the UN General Assembly.  Bermudez also thanked 
the Carter Center and the OAS for their ongoing help mediating 
between the two sides. 
 
 
11 POINT PLAN FOR WAY FORWARD 
 
----------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) The GOC and the GOE released an 11-point communique 
outlining the terms of the bilateral thaw.  Among the most 
important points were that Colombia pledged to refrain from 
military or security operations in Ecuadorian territory, while 
Ecuador promised it would not tolerate the presence of illegal 
armed groups in its territory -- and further vowed to repel them 
with force, if necessary.  The two governments also proposed the 
creation of mechanisms to improve conditions for Colombian refugees 
living in Ecuador, with the GOC pledging to work with NGOs and 
other governments to provide funds and services for them.  (NOTE: 
The GOE estimates that about 600,000 Colombians live in its 
territory, 135,000 of which the UN High Commissioner for Refugees 
thinks need international protection as refugees. End Note.)  They 
also announced the reactivation of the Binational Border Commission 
and Neighbor Committees to improve coordination and communication 
between the two countries' civilian, police, and military 
authorities. 
 
 
¶4. (U) In the 11 points, Colombia and Ecuador said ongoing legal 
disputes between the two countries would not be part of this 
initial dialogue.  This was a clear reference to the international 
arrest warrant an Ecuadorian judge issued in June for former 
Colombian defense minister Juan Manuel Santos in connection with 
the 2008 raid, and to Ecuador's legal processes against Colombia at 
the Hague over aerial fumigation.  While the GOC explicitly noted 
it does not recognize extraterritorial jurisdiction for Ecuador to 
prosecute current or past GOC officials, the GOE said it would 
respect the independence of its judicial authorities.  Both 
governments asked for further mediation from the Carter Center and 
the OAS on particularly sensitive topics, including security, crime 
control (e.g., narcotrafficking and violent crime) and economic 
development in the border area. 
 
 
GOC SEES STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE, 
 
GOE SEEKS PROGRESS ON ISSUES 
 
----------------------------- 
 
¶5. (C/NF) Bermudez and Defense Minister Silva told us they had seen 
an opening with Ecuador during the recent UNASUR summit, and they 
hoped to drive a wedge between Ecuador and Venezuela (reftel). 
Ambassador Carlos Morales, MFA Acting Director for Latin America 
and the Caribbean, told Poloff on September 28 that Colombia hopes 
to reinvigorate commercial flows with Ecuador to partly offset 
trade woes with Venezuela. 
 
¶6. (C) Morales opined that the GOE's change in attitude was forced 
by Ecuador's need to address diplomatically a range of issues, 
including trade, refugees, narcotics, and crime.  He credited 
President Correa's sudden constructive attitude as chair of recent 
UNASUR meetings, the GOC's decision to participate at high levels 
in both the UNASUR Bariloche summit and Quito ministerial, 
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe's repeated apologies (most 
recently at the Bariloche summit) for the cross-border raid, and 
mediation by the Carter Center for the warming of relations.  The 
ball was set in motion when two countries' foreign ministers met 
quietly a few months ago at the Carter Center in Atlanta, Morales 
said. 
 
WAY AHEAD NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR 
 
---------------------------- 
 
¶7. (C/NF) Bermudez explained that both governments planned to have 
working groups initiate a process of direct dialogue by 
mid-October, with the goal of re-establishing full diplomatic 
relations as quickly as possible.  However, Colombian Vice Minister 
of Defense Sergio Jaramillo told us he was not convinced the GOE 
was entirely committed to the process.  Moreover, it is unclear 
whether the strategy of ignoring the Santos warrant will prevent it 
from coming back to derail the rapprochement.  Ambassador Morales 
lamented Minister Silva's "unhelpful" declarations at a public 
event on September 27 that full diplomatic relations cannot exist 
if Ecuador insists on prosecuting Colombian officials and does not 
fulfill its promise to combat transnational criminals. 
 
 
¶8. (C) Morales said the Colombian MFA would get to work immediately 
implementing the 11-point accord.  At the top of the agenda are 
 
selecting a Charge' to send to Quito, establishing bilateral 
working groups to discuss remaining issues, and formalizing the 
mechanisms for mediation through the Carter Center and OAS.  The 
naming of Charges would provide direct diplomatic channels, 
replacing communication through the Argentine Embassy in Quito. 
While the communique was the first major positive step in 
re-establishing ties, Moreno opined that the number of pending 
issues would delay the resumption of full ties beyond this year. 
 
COMMENT: USG SUPPORT IN PLACE 
 
----------------------------- 
¶9. (C) As the verbal barrage and commercial threats from Venezuelan 
President Hugo Chavez continue, the GOC is eager to improve 
relations with neighboring Ecuador.  Embassy Bogota and Embassy 
Quito's Northern Border Working Group carried out two days of 
consultations in Bogota on September 24-25 to consider a range of 
possible USG activities to support the 11 points (septel).
