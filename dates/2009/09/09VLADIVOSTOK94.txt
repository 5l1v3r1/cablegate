¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Consulate Vladivostok, in collaboration with 
the Vladivostok State University of Economics and Service

Participants from Russia, Mongolia, Japan, India, China, South 
Korea, and U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) discussed a wide range 
of issues under the theme of "Security in Northeast Asia -- Has 
the Pacific Century Arrived?"  Among the highlights was the

Security: Past Fears versus Future Challenges" by Professor 
Viktor Larin, Russian Academy of Sciences - Far Eastern Branch, 
and Director of the Institute of History, Archaeology, and 
Ethnology of the Peoples of the Far East.  Additional stellar

Asian Studies, School of International Studies, Jawaharlal Nehru 
University who delivered a paper on the topic of "The 
Significance of India-Russia Relations in an Asia Pacific 
Context."  Each participant benefited from expanding his/her 
professional network and from gaining new insights into various 
aspects of Northeast Asia regional security.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) Background:  The Symposium on Northeast Asia Security 
(SNEAS) began in 1996 as a follow-on program to the EAP/PD and 
USPACOM sponsored Symposium on East Asia Security (SEAS).  From 
its start, SNEAS was envisioned as a forum to promote discussion 
among security specialists from Northeast Asian nations, many of 
whom were SEAS alumni.  SNEAS focuses on emerging regional 
security issues, the U.S. role in regional stability, 
cooperation among Northeast Asian countries, and the full range 
of Korean Peninsula issues. 
 
¶3. (U) Professor Viktor Larin (Russian Academy of Sciences - Far 
Eastern Branch, and Director of the Institute of History, 
Archaeology, and Ethnology of the Peoples of the Far East), an 
alumnus of the Symposium on East Asia Security (an important 
objective of SNEAS is to provide an opportunity for alumni of 
EAP/PD's and USPACOM's premier collaborative program effort - 
the Symposium on East Asia Security or SEAS - to discuss 
security concerns specific to Northeast Asia with fellow alumni 
of EAP security programs) highlighted an engaged and energetic 
group of security experts from Russia, Mongolia, Japan, India, 
China, South Korea, and U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM). 
Following welcoming remarks by Consul General Tom Armbruster and 
Primorsky Territory Legislative Assembly (Duma) Chairman Viktor 
Gorchakov, Professor Larin's keynote speech on Tuesday, 15 
September, on the theme "A Hazy Shape of East Asian Security: 
Past Fears versus Future Challenges," launched a series of 
discussions on topics ranging from North Korean weapons 
proliferation to Russo-Sino relations to India-Russia relations. 
 More than three dozen official participants and a number of 
local observers, including representatives from Vladivostok's 
diplomatic community (Consul Generals from Japan, India, and 
Vietnam among others, attended the symposium), attended the

robustly attended reception in honor of the participants on 
Tuesday, 15 September.  In an offer greatly appreciated by the 
foreign participants in the symposium, VGUES arranged for a 
dozen of its students to act as guides; the students, whose 
English speaking abilities were excellent, offered walking and 
shopping tours of Vladivostok on the morning of 17 September, 
prior to the departure of the participants to the airport. The 
Russian students were polled about whether the Pacific is indeed 
the ocean of the future and while many named hometown 
Vladivostok as the most promising capital for commerce, others 
said that San Francisco, Tokyo, or Honolulu may become the 
world's leading city this century. 
 
¶9. (U) Symposium participants expressed appreciation for the 
chance to meet their international colleagues and noted that 
they had already formed the foundations of a network of security 
professionals which would enable them to maintain contact with 
each other.  An email list of participants' cell phone numbers 
and email addresses was provided to each member of SNEAS 2009. 
 
¶10. (U) Press coverage of the event was positive, with local and 
national news stations and newspapers covering the opening of 
the symposium and conducting interviews during the breaks. 
Scholars from each of the participating countries have promised 
to publish articles on the conference; background attribution 
rules will be followed. 
 
¶11. (SBU) Comment:  SNEAS 2009 achieved its dual goals of 
furthering U.S. foreign and military policy goals in the 
Northeast Asia region and expanding and strengthening EAP/PD's 
and USPACOM's network of security professionals in the region. 
The opportunity for military and civilian security professionals 
from Russia, China, Japan, Korea, and Mongolia to discuss 
together the most pressing issues facing their governments was 
invaluable; also, in Vladivostok, for the first time, a 
participant from India participated in the symposium, and his 
contributions and insights proved extremely valuable for his 
colleagues.  The security and economic discussions among 
established and rising military and economic powers established 
a consensus among the participants that the concerns of each 
nation must be addressed constructively, openly, and without 
delay, in order to prevent misunderstandings, miscalculations, 
and missteps in Northeast Asia during the 21st century -- the 
Pacific Century.
