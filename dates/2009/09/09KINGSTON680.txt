Classified By: CDA ISIAH L. PARNELL, REASONS 1.5 (B) AND (D) 
 
Summary: 
 
1.(C) Audrey Marks, the founder and Chief Executive Officer 
(CEO) of Paymaster (Jamaica) Ltd. and a close advisor to 
Prime Minister (PM) Bruce Golding, met with the CDA at 
Embassy Kingston 
on September 8, 2009, to deliver a message from the PM 
regarding the USG's August 26 extradition request for 
Christopher "Dudus" Coke on drug and weapon trafficking 
charges. Speaking for the PM, Marks said that the Government 
of Jamaica (GOJ) would be taking "some" action "soon" against 
Coke, but urged the USG not to publicly pressure the GOJ into 
action. Marks also relayed that the GOJ would announce her 
appointment as Ambassador to the 
United States in November. End Summary. 
 
WILL REACT "POSITIVELY" TO COKE EXTRADITION REQUEST 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
¶2. (C) Marks relayed that the PM and the GOJ were very 
concerned about the Coke affair and were committed to acting 
"positively" to the U.S.'s extradition request, but no 
timetable was offered. Through Marks, the PM sought 
clarification as to how "patient" the USG would be in 
allowing the GOJ time to apprehend and turn Coke over to USG 
authorities. Marks also relayed the PM's request for USG 
"logistical support" in Coke's arrest and extradition, while 
requesting that the USG not apply additional pressure to the 
PM by publicly demanding prompt action. 
 
¶3. (C) As suggested Reftels, the PM is very concerned about 
the prospects for social unrest in downtown Kingston once 
Coke is taken into custody. Marks communicated that the PM 
was surprised by the extradition request, although the CDA 
reiterated that the PM had been fully briefed on the 
impending extradition request by the former U.S. Ambassador 
several months ago. The PM is committed to good governance 
and the maintenance of law and order, Marks emphasized, 
although she admitted that the Coke extradition request had 
been particularly problematic for the GOJ. 
 
¶4. (C) The CDA stressed to Marks how important it is to the 
USG that the GOJ observe its treaty obligations and cooperate 
in Coke's extradition. Normally such extradition requests are 
executed within two to three weeks of the issuance of a 
diplomatic note. The CDA emphasized the USG's expectation 
that the GOJ will not refuse the extradition request on a 
technicality that had not been cited in similar extradition 
requests.  CDA also noted that the extradition request on an 
earlier indictment for Mark Clark had not been acted upon. 
He expressed his hope that inaction would not be the norm for 
extradition requests. 
 
Marks To Be Appointed Ambassador to U.S. 
--------------------------------------- 
¶5. (C) Additionally, Marks disclosed that she would be 
appointed Ambassador to the United States in November 2009. 
The current ambassador, Anthony Johnson, would be appointed 
High 
Commissioner to the United Kingdom.
