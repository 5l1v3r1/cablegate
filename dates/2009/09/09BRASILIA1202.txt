¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY.  The Government of Brazil (GOB) understands and 
is concerned by the growing use of HFCs to replace HCFCs. 
Nonetheless, it is opposed to both the U.S.-Mexico-Canada and the 
Mauritius and Micronesia proposals to the Montreal Protocol to 
address this problem.  The GOB sees such proposals as undermining 
the Kyoto Protocol, which covers HFCs already.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Per REFTEL, Science Counselor met on September 24 with 
Bianca Abreu, the officer handling the Montreal Protocol within the 
Ministry of External Relations' (MRE) Division of Sustainable 
Development Policy, to discuss the U.S.-Canada-Mexico proposal to 
the Montreal Protocol.  That proposal would phase down the 
consumption and production of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), greenhouse 
gases currently controlled under the United Nations Framework 
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and its Kyoto Protocol, and 
that are substitutes to ozone depleting chemicals being eliminated 
under the Montreal Protocol.  Abreu already had received a copy of 
the proposal and had analyzed it carefully. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Abreu said that Government of Brazil (GOB) agrees with the 
goal of this proposal to take action to prevent the growth in the 
use of HFC, which are the fact that HFCs are the predominant 
low-cost substitutes for hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) being 
phased out under the Montreal Protocol.  While she thought that this 
proposal was more effective than the proposal of Mauritius and the 
Federated States of Micronesia to address the same problem, she 
stated that the GOB could not support either one. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The issue for the GOB is that HFC's are included under the 
Kyoto Protocol.  The GOB sees these two proposal as "weakening" the 
Kyoto Protocol.  Abreu recognized the attempt in Article III of the 
U.S.-Mexico-Canada proposal to address the possible conflict between 
the Montreal Protocol and the Kyoto Protocol.  She said that was not 
satisfactory.  The GOB was opposed to any amendment to the Montreal 
Protocol dealing with a chemical covered by the Kyoto Protocol. 
Abreu said that the MRE still needed to coordinate with the other 
interested ministries and agencies, but she did not expect there to 
be a change in position on this critical point. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The GOB does recognize that the growing use of HFCs is a 
problem.  One way to deal with the problem that they could support 
would be to create incentives and financing to help countries that 
are eliminating HCFCs to move to some chemical other than HFCs, one 
that was not a greenhouse gas or a threat to the ozone layer.  This 
could be done with a modification to the regulations governing the 
Montreal Protocol's financing mechanisms. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) COMMENT.  It is good to see that the GOB views with 
concern the growing use of HFCs and thinks the U.S.-Canada-Mexico 
proposal is better than that of Mauritius and Micronesia.  The 
fundamental challenge for getting Brazil on board will be finding an 
approach that doesn't raises alarms for them about undermining the 
Kyoto Protocol.  The use of positive, financial incentives to avoid 
switching to HFCs could be a starting place for a conversation on 
this issue.  END COMMENT.
