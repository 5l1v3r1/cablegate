REF: STATE 86548 
 
(SBU) On August 24 and subsequently, Poloff discussed reftel 
demarche on the candidacy of Ms. Lucretia F. Myers for the 
International Civil Service Commission (ICSC) with Emmanuel 
Cocher,  MFA Director for United Nations institutional 
issues.  Cocher confirmed September 8 that Myers' candidacy 
had only recently been raised for internal discussion, and 
there was wide agreement that she was well-qualified for the 
position.  Coucher went so far as to say that Myers could be 
considered "a priori France's choice," but added that it was 
too early for the government to confirm its vote for a 
specific candidate.  He clarified that there were still 
"strategic" discussions to be held on how France will vote 
for a wide range of candidates, suggesting that there are yet 
deals to be made related to other IO races.
