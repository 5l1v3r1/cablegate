Classified By: MICHAEL P. OWENS, ACTING DIR, INR/OPS. REASON: 1.4(C). 
 
¶1.  (C/NF)  WASHINGTON ANALYSTS WISH TO THANK THE POLITICAL 
SECTION FOR THE TWO DETAILED AND TIMELY REFTELS ON BRAZILIAN 
FOREIGN POLICY.  BRASILIA 001041 PROVIDED A THOROUGH RUNDOWN 
OF BRASILIA'S REACTION TO THE RECENT US-COLOMBIA DEFENSE 
AGREEMENT, WHICH GARNERED SUBSTANTIAL ATTENTION FROM US 
POLICYMAKERS IN WASHINGTON.  WE WILL USE INSIGHTS FROM THE 
CABLE IN AN UPCOMING ASSESSMENT OF BRAZIL'S REGIONAL FOREIGN 
POLICY.  WE ALSO APPRECIATED BRASILIA 001038, WHICH PROVIDED 
A DETAILED READOUT OF US OFFICIALS' VISITS WITH HIGH-LEVEL 
LULA ADMINISTRATION COUNTERPARTS ON KEY GLOBAL ISSUES, 
INCLUDING NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION, NORTH KOREA, AND IRAN. 
THE CABLE DID A PARTICULARLY FINE JOB OF HIGHLIGHTING POLICY 
DIFFERENCES AMONG KEY ACTORS WITHIN THE BRAZILIAN FOREIGN 
POLICY ESTABLISHMENT, ESPECIALLY WITH REGARD TO THE 
ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL.  INSIGHTS FROM REFTEL WILL BE USED IN 
TWO UPCOMING ASSESSMENTS OF BRAZILIAN FOREIGN POLICY.  US 
POLICYMAKERS REMAIN INTERESTED IN BRASILIA'S STANCE ON KEY 
GLOBAL ISSUES AS ITS INTERNATIONAL CLOUT GROWS AND, MORE 
IMMEDIATELY, AS BRASILIA PREPARES TO TAKE A NON-PERMANENT 
SEAT ON THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL THIS JANUARY.  MANY THANKS 
FOR THE TIMELY AND VALUABLE REPORTING.
