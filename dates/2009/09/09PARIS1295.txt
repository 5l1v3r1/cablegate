SUBJECT: FRANCE SUPPORTS U.S. FOR IMO COUNCIL 
 
REF: STATE 98012 
 
(SBU) On September 22, MFA Deputy Director for International 
Organizations, Emmanuel Cocher, responded favorably to refel 
demarche on supporting the U.S. candidacy to the 
International Maritime Organization (IMO) Council.  He 
explained that France, having already completed appropriate 
interagency reviews, would soon be formally notifying current 
Category A countries that it supports their reelection. 
Cocher added that one of France's goals at the IMO is 
"stabilize the membership within the categories."  Therefore, 
Cocher requested that the U.S. support France's reelection 
bid to Category B, should the race be contested.
