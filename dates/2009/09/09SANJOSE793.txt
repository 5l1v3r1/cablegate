FOR DIALOGUE 
 
REF: SECSTATE 95073 
 
¶1. (SBU) Costa Rican Foreign Minister Bruno Stagno told us on 
September 21 that while the GOCR agrees with our position 
regarding Iran's nuclear program (reftel), it does not 
anticipate any opportunity to communicate this message to 
Iran in the near future.  The GOCR does not have diplomatic 
relations with Iran, is not part of the non-aligned movement, 
and does not have any planned meetings with the GOI at the 
UNGA or the General Conference of the IAEA.  Stagno also used 
the opportunity to express his dissatisfaction with more 
lenient US policies on nuclear proliferation, in particular 
USG policies towards Israeli, Indian, and Pakistani nuclear 
programs. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Comment: Costa Rica, which abolished its military in 
1949, has widely called for the complete demilitarization of 
Latin America and is deeply interested in international 
non-proliferation and disarmament issues.  As such, Stagno's 
light criticism of USG policies is not unexpected.  However, 
the GOCR remains committed to international (and USG) efforts 
to oppose Iran's nuclear weapons program.  That said, as 
Stagno admitted, they have no real ability to influence the 
GOI on this, or any other, matter.
