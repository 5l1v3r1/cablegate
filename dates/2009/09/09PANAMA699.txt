SUBJECT: MARTINELLI MOUNTS DOMESTIC SPY OPERATION, PUTS DEA 
WIRETAP PROGRAM AT RISK 
 
REF: PANAMA 639 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Barbara J. Stephenson for reasons 1.4 (b) and 
 (d) 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (S//NF) President Martinelli is following through on his 
intention to expand the duties of Panama's Council of Public 
Security and National Defense ("Consejo") to include spying 
on domestic political enemies (reftel).  Martinelli has told 
the Ambassador that he no longer needs USG help to establish 
a wiretap program to eavesdrop on his enemies, and that he 
can do so with help from other sources.  He has replaced the 
director of Consejo and fired some 25 Consejo professionals 
for alleged links to Consejo's former managers under the 
Torrijos administration, with indications of more firings to 
come.  Among those fired was the manager of DEA's Matador 
judicialized wiretap program.  The loss of that person and 
the re-orientation of Consejo to domestic political targets 
puts at risk the integrity of the Matador program, and we 
believe that Consejo is no longer an appropriate home for 
Matador.  We are exploring options for transferring control 
of Matador to Panama's drug prosecutor and removing Consejo 
from operational involvement in the program.  End summary.

Where's the Dirt? 
----------------- 
 
¶2. (S//NF) Following the Ambassador's  August 12 meeting in 
which Martinelli requested USG help with establishing a 
politically-oriented wiretap program (reftel), the president 
again raised the subject with Ambassador on September 16. 
This time, Martinelli announced that he no longer needed USG 
help to set up his wiretap operation, and that he would be 
doing so with help from other sources.  Martinelli complained 
that after 75 days in office, he was still not receiving the 
kind of information he wanted about perceived domestic 
threats and political enemies.  For that reason, he said he 
had removed Consejo chief Jaime Trujillo and replaced him 
with Olmedo Alfaro, head of the Institutional Protection 
Service (SPI), the GOP's VIP protection service.  Trujillo 
will move to SPI and take over Alfaro's position.  Martinelli 
said that Trujillo was a "good guy" who was "completely 
honest" and had worked for Martinelli for 22 years, but that 
he could not provide the kind of information the president 
wanted because he was "too honest."  At the same time, 
Martinelli told Ambassador he had fired 25 Consejo employees 
because of their connections to former Consejo deputy 
director Javier Fletcher. 
----------------- 
We Can't Help You 
----------------- 
¶3. (S//NF) As she had done in the August 12 meeting, the 
Ambassador made clear to Martinelli that DEA's wiretap 
program cnnot be compromised by involvement with a domestic 
political surveillance operation.  The Ambassador noted that 
one of those fired was the veteran Consejo staffer who 
managed the Matador wire room, and she asked whether the 
president would consider reinstating that person.  Martinelli 
refused, saying that the person had maintained a personal 
relationship with Fletcher's brother and was therefore 
untrustworthy. 
-------------------------- 
Who's Sleeping With Whom? 
-------------------------- 
¶4. (S//NF) Separately, DEA chief met with new Consejo head 
Alfaro on September 16.  Alfaro told DEA chief, "I know why 
you are here. I made some changes and I am not going to 
change them." Alfaro said he had orders from the president to 
find out who "was sleeping with his wife." At the same time, 
he wanted to make sure he and the president were "covered" 
and that someone else would be responsible if something bad 
 
happened. He said that he was trying to change the process 
for approving the judicial wiretaps by bringing a special 
judge into the wireroom to approve taps. (Comment: This would 
cut DEA out of the approval process. End Comment.) Alfaro 
made it clear that Martinelli had tasked him to collect 
information on the president's political adversaries, and 
that Trujillo had been removed for failing to deliver what 
the president wanted.

Comment 
------- 
¶5. (S//NF) In light of Martinelli's actions, it is clear to 
us that Consejo is no longer an appropriate home for the DEA 
Matador program.  We believe it will be more appropriately 
housed with the office of the drug prosecutor, under Panama's 
independent Attorney General.  We will be discussing options 
with senior GOP leaders for removing Consejo from operational 
involvement with Matador, and permanently replacing the fired 
Consejo manager with a vetted officer from the Attorney 
General's office.  That change of supervision would be the 
minimum requirement to maintain operation of Matador, and if 
the GOP does not agree to that change, we will be compelled 
to suspend operations until a permanent solution can be found.
