Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al-Quds and Al-Ayyam dailies lead with a story on Special Envoy 
George Mitchell's trip to the region, noting that there is a 
consensus among the Arab states that the continuation of Israeli 
settlement activity will lead to the failure of international peace 
efforts. The Arab states are also calling for an international 
committee to investigate issues relating to former Palestinian land 
and properties within "Green Line" Israel, according to coverage. 
Al-Quds quotes Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Al-Malki calling on 
the Arab states not to move towards normalization with Israel. 
 
In related news, Al-Quds highlights Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin 
Netanyahu saying that Israel "will not offer any compromises" and 
"will not allow the establishment of a terrorist state in the West 
Bank." 
 
The three dailies front page news on the Palestinian Liberation 
Organization's (PLO) positive reaction to the Egyptian plan 
submitted earlier this week containing suggestions for internal 
Palestinian reconciliation, according to the PLO Executive 
Committee's Secretary General Yasser Abed-Rabbo. 
 
Al-Quds highlights Israeli settlers attempting to "take over" the 
house of the Al-Dawodi family in the Old City of Jerusalem. Al-Quds 
reports that five settlers stormed into the house after breaking the 
locks while the family was out.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Yahya Rabah opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily under the 
title "The Winners and the Losers" (09/11): "There are no winners or 
losers in the events of September 11. Everyone is a loser and no 
group, no matter how strong, can save themselves and isolate 
themselves from the weakest group in the world.  There cannot be 
hundreds of millions of poor people and also security. We can't have 
millions of oppressed and then pretend there is security. And the 
Israeli occupation cannot continue to disregard the lives of 
Palestinians and Arabs and then hope that everyone enjoys 
security." 
2) Mohammad Yaghi opines in Al-Ayyam daily under the headline 
"Obama: Hour of Truth Draws Near" (09/11):"Obama is the one who 
redefined the US policy to make it more balanced. He is the one who 
revived terminology that was last used prior to President Reagan 
when he described settlement activities as illegal and tried to halt 
these activities in the occupied lands, including Jerusalem.  And 
Obama is the one who reminded us that the origin of this conflict is 
not the June 4th (1967) war but the tragedy of the displacement of 
the Palestinian people in 1948. He is the one who clearly stated 
that putting an end to the Arab-Israeli conflict, especially the 
Palestinian-Israeli conflict, contributes to eliminating 
terrorism."
