IOM SIGNS TERMS OF ENGAGEMENT WITH SOUTH DARFUR HAC 
---------------------------- ---------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) On September 15, IOM and the South Darfur HAC signed "Terms 
of Engagement." This document closely replicates the Memorandum of 
Understanding with IOM, the Government of National Unity, and the 
United Nations (UN), signed on August 21, 2004.  The new agreement 
will permit IOM to recommence operations in South Darfur that have 
been stalled since February. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) IOM expressed concern at the government's high 
expectations for IOM's support for returns, which the organization 
must carefully manage.  In discussions with the South Darfur HAC, 
IOM emphasized that the organization's primary role is population 
tracking and assessing the voluntary and appropriate nature of 
returns.  IOM is already working to monitor and map returns in seven 
rural councils in North Darfur.  IOM plans to reinstate the Returns 
Working Group, and has invited the South Darfur HAC to participate. 
To complement IOM's work with protection monitoring, UN agencies 
continue to advocate for the South Darfur HAC to allow the Office of 
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to resume operations 
in the state. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment:  In a recent note to UN agencies and 
non-governmental organizations (NGOs) regarding 2010 strategy 
planning for Darfur, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator (HC) for Darfur 
noted that "Darfur today is not the Darfur of 2003 and 2004."  IDP 
needs have evolved with time; many IDPs are integrating into urban 
and peripheral urban areas, while some are returning home for 
seasonal activities or permanent resettlement.  In fact, the HC 
projects that larger numbers of IDPs may return home in 2010 than 
during previous years, and consequently, NGOs and UN agencies must 
be more vigilant regarding returns planning and response. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Comment continued:  IOM advises that humanitarian agencies 
consider returns in the overall context of community needs in areas 
of return, rather than thinking of returnees as a stand-alone 
beneficiary group meriting targeted assistance.   There is fear that 
labeling individuals as "returnees" with special benefits could 
stimulate artificial population displacements in search of 
distributions.  Moreover, an appearance of bias toward returnees 
could aggravate inter-community conflicts that lie at the root of 
the Darfur crisis.  Finally, upholding the principles of voluntary 
and appropriate return remains the foundation of international 
support for sustainable returns.  The news that IOM will be a 
present and active partner in South Darfur is very good news.  End 
Comment.
