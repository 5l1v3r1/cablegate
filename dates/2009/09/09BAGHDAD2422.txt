The Honorable Joseph R. Biden

Washington, DC 
 
Dear Vice President Biden, 
I write this letter to offer my sincere and heartfelt 
condolences for the loss of the Honorable Edward M. Kennedy, 
United States Senator from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. 
 Senator Kennedy played a central role over the years in the 
service of his state and country; he will be missed dearly 
not only by his friends and family but all of the people of 
the United States. 
 
I am sure that he is survived by his political colleagues who 
will continue to carry his egalitarian voice and message. 
Please accept my heartfelt condolences and I would much 
appreciate conveying these feelings to President Obama. 
 
Sincerely, 
 
/s/ 
 
Rafe H. Al-Eissawi 
Deputy Prime Minister 
Republic of Iraq
