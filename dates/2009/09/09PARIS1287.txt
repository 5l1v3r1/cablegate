REF: STATE 97170 
 
(SBU) France would be interested in attending an informal 
meeting of Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) supporters on 
the margins of the September 24-25 CTBT Article XIV 
Conference, according to MFA nonproliferation officer Celine 
Jurgensen.  France is in total agreement with the United 
States on the importance of the CTBT and the Article XIV 
Conference, which the GOF is co-hosting with Morocco. 
Jurgensen said French attendance at the proposed informal 
meeting would depend on scheduling issues, but added the 
French ambassador to their mission to Geneva may head the 
French delegation.
