¶1.  U.S.-CHINA ECONOMIC AND CONGRESSIONAL RELATIONS 
 
"$12.38 billion contract signed; new energy promotes Sino-U.S. 
economic and trade relationship" 
 
The Shanghai-based Shanghai Media Group (SMG) publication, China 
Business News (Diyi Caijing)(09/10)(pg A3): "The U.S. and China have 
reached 41 agreements on investment and economic and technical 
cooperation worth a total of $12.38 billion and encompassing diverse 
industries, such as new energy, raw materials, telecommunications, 
electronics, machineries, and tourism.  Wu Bangguo, Chairman of the 
National People's Congress Standing Committee, said the two 
countries' common goal is sustained U.S.-China economic cooperation. 
 Economic and trade cooperation between the U.S. and China has a 
bright future.  In terms of structural adjustments in the economies 
of both China and the U.S., bilateral cooperation on low carbon 
technologies, renewable resources, clean energy, and alternative 
energy vehicles will become a dynamic, new source of economic growth 
in both countries.  Through this deal, China can get U.S. 
technologies and the U.S. can increase employment, demonstrating 
that the Sino-U.S. relationship is mutually beneficial.  The U.S. 
and China will continue their cooperation in the fields of energy 
and climate change against this backdrop.  With the date of Obama's 
visit to China drawing nearer, these sorts of deals are expected to 
continue." 
 
"Communication mechanisms between Congresses of China and U.S. 
beneficial to healthy development of bilateral relations" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) 
(09/10)(pg 2): "Sheng Huaren, Secretary General of the Standing 
Committee of the National People's Congress, discussed four 
characteristics of the communication mechanisms that currently exist 
between the Congresses of China and the U.S.  First, these 
mechanisms are 'high level and authoritative,' which has not been 
the case in the past.  Second, the annual meeting between the two 
countries' Congresses has been standardized.  Third, the issues 
discussed at the meeting are of concern to both countries.  And 
fourth, the leaders of both countries have paid a lot of attention 
to the meeting and have tried to support it in many ways.  Sheng 
also said that communication between the Congresses of China and the 
United States has been positive, and neither China nor the United 
States wants to see this change due to changes in leadership." 
 
¶2.  CHINA COUNTERTERRORISM LEGISLATION 
 
"China calls for counterterrorism legislation on eve of the eighth 
anniversary of 9/11" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao)(09/10)(pg 7): "Li 
Wei, Director of the Counterterrorism Studies Center at the China 
Institute of Contemporary International Relations, said that since 
9/11 China has strengthened its counterterrorism capabilities by 
creating counterterrorism mechanisms and institutes, establishing, 
for example, a Counterterrorism Bureau in the Public Security 
Ministry and a Department of External Security Affairs in the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  China has always actively participated 
in international counterterrorism efforts, and a counterterrorism 
drill called 'Great Wall No. 6' was held in June.  China's 
counterterrorism system is beginning to take shape, but the current 
laws are insufficient to punish and deter terrorists.  The 7/5 (July 
5) incident in Xinjiang this year has brought to the fore the need 
for a counterterrorism law in China.  To fight against the 'three 
forces' (ethnic separatism, religious extremism, and violent 
terrorism), China needs to develop counterterrorism laws.  China has 
sped up its efforts to draft such a law and will submit it to the 
National People's Congress for approval 'when the right time 
comes.'"
