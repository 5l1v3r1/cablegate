SUBJECT: HUMAN RIGHTS COUNCIL -- SEEKING GOI SUPPORT FOR 
RESOLUTION ON DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN 
 
REF: STATE 100316 
 
¶1.  (U) Poloff delivered reftel demarche regarding the UN 
Human Rights Council draft resolution on "Elimination of 
Discrimination Against Women" to officials at the Indonesian 
Department of Foreign Affairs (DEPLU) on September 29.  We 
noted U.S. support for the appointment of an Independent 
Expert and explained that we could not support paragraphs of 
the draft resolution which recalled the outcomes of the two 
UN conferences on racism.  We urged Indonesia to support the 
Independent Expert mandate and to encourage other Asian 
states to do the same. 
 
¶2.  (U) DEPLU interlocutors took our points on board and 
promised to review the matter fully.  They said that the 
Indonesian delegation in Geneva looked forward to working 
with U.S. officials on the substance of the resolution.
