SUBJECT: SURVEY INDICATES PRIVATE SECTOR NOT INVESTING LONG 
TERM IN VENEZUELA 
 
REF: CARACAS 1104 
 
¶1.  (U) Venezuelan businesspeople are pessimistic about the 
current state of the economy, according to a recent survey 
conducted by the Venezuelan American Chamber of Commerce of 
156 businesses. Of those surveyed, thirty-seven percent do 
not plan to invest in Venezuela (in the short, medium or long 
term).  The survey indicated that twenty-six percent plan to 
invest in the short term, thirty percent in the medium term, 
and only seven percent plan to invest in the long term. The 
survey also demonstrated that fifty-two percent of the 
businesses said that their sales fell over the last year and 
only thirty percent registered an increase in sales compared 
to the previous year.  Thirty-one percent of the businesses 
have had to reduce their labor force over the last year. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) COMMENT:  This data shows the impact of the current 
economic crisis on the private sector in Venezuela and puts 
the economic contraction into perspective (reftel).  Economic 
problems compounded by the GBRV's economic policies have led 
many businesses to question the future for the private sector 
in Venezuela.
