(SBU) Post delivered the demarche as requested in reftel to 
Director Pertti Anttinen in the MFA Department for 
Development Policy and to Director General Veli-Pekka Talvela 
in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry.  Talvela, while 
reinforcing Finland's commitment to food security, deferred 
to the MFA which controls the development budget.  Anttinen 
reacted positively to a nonpaper containing points from 
reftel, which he had already passed to his Director General. 
While the ministry was still in the process of making exact 
budget calculations in the aftermath of the previous week's 
budget talks among the governing coalition parties, Anttinen 
stated that Finland is committed to increasing its share of 
financing for food security in line with its broad goal of 
increasing funding of development assistance in multilateral 
and bilateral programs.  The ministry was still in the 
process of calculating exact budgetary allocations for 2010 
and beyond, so he could not promise an exact amount at this 
time.  Anttinen concluded by noting that he expected food 
security to be discussed during U.S.-EU talks next week in 
Brussels as part of Finland's Transatlantic Development 
Partnership initiative.
