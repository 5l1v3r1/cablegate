¶1.  (SBU) Per REFTEL A, on September 11 Science Counselor and 
Science Officer discussed with Brazil's Ministry of External 
Relations' (MRE) Acting Director of the Division for Disarmament and 
Sensitive Technologies (DDS) Fabio Simao Alves the proposal to 
transfer of low-level radioactive items from Brazil's Angra I 
nuclear power plant to the United States for decontamination and 
disposal.  Earlier, per REFTEL B, the Embassy had sent the MRE a 
diplomatic note (no. 456 in September 2008) regarding this proposed 
import into the United States from Brazil of low level radioactive 
protective clothing for decontamination and disposal.  Following 
delivery of that diplomatic note, Emboffs had pressed the MRE/DDS 
for a response.  On those occasions, the MRE/DDS said that a 
response would be forthcoming, but until this latest meeting that 
had not happened. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Now, we have an answer.  Acting Director Alves said he had 
looked into the matter.  He informed Post that the Brazilian 
state-owned company Eletronuclear had the protective clothing and 
that it planned to decontaminate and dispose of the clothing in 
Brazil.  Therefore, Brazil no longer has plans to export this low 
level radioactive clothing to the United States for decontamination 
and disposal.
