KIDNAPPINGS 
 
REF: A. A) KHARTOUM 905 
     ¶B. B) KHARTOUM 994 
 
Classified By: CDA Robert E. Whitehead, for reasons 1.4 (b) and (d) 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY: On the margins of a September 3 meeting on 
the upcoming visit of SE Gration, Presidential Advisor Dr. 
Ghazi Salaheddin told CDA Whitehead that the September 7 
trial of Ms. Lubna Hussein, the Sudanese journalist arrested 
in Khartoum for wearing trousers on July 3, could result in a 
fine but not flogging. He also expressed concern about the 
rash of kidnappings in Sudan's Darfur region, noting that the 
Government of Sudan (GOS) was seeking to counter the trend by 
refusing to pay ransoms and refraining from risky rescue 
operations. END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (C) Dr. Ghazi said that he was dismayed that the case of 
Ms. Hussein, who was arrested in Khartoum on July 3 and 
charged with "indecent dress" for wearing trousers in public 
(Ref A), was continuing to attract unwanted attention. He 
added that "thousands of women on the streets of Khartoum 
wear trousers without managing to be arrested." Ghazi stated 
that he had spoken with Minister of Justice Abdelbasit 
Sabdarat, who assured him that if Ms. Hussein were found 
guilty, she would not be flogged. However, if found guilty 
would likely be required to pay a fine. 
 
¶3. (C) Dr. Ghazi expressed concern about the proliferation of 
kidnappings in Darfur, most recently the abduction of two UN 
staff in Zalingei in West Darfur (Ref B) and the long-running 
hostage saga involving staff of the Irish NGO GOAL near 
Kutum. With regard to the latter case, the Wali (Governor) of 
North Darfur has been in frequent contact with the 
kidnappers, said Ghazi. The Wali was "at one point about to 
make a deal" to buy the kidnappers off with payment of 
ransom, a ploy that Ghazi vetoed for fear that it would 
provoke a rash of copycat attempts. He had informed the 
kidnappers through the Wali that the maximum the GOS could 
promise the kidnappers (in exchange for release of the 
hostages) was freedom from prosecution.  Ghazi said that a 
rescue operation with the use of force is also off the table 
for now because of the inherent risks to the hostages, and he 
characterized the current situation as "a battle of 
attrition."  He said that the GOS had identified the 
perpetrators as "unruly elements" from an Arab tribe. 
 
¶4. (C)  COMMENT: The Hussein incident remains an 
embarrassment that the GOS hopes will go away after the 
trial. The implications posed by the kidnappings are 
sobering, since they limit the ability and willingness of 
NGOs to work outside of the larger towns to deliver 
humanitarian aid, to assist with voluntary returns of 
Darfurian IDPs, or to undertake the development and recovery 
work that will be required to address many of the underlying 
causes of the Darfur conflict.
