"Obama gives strength to Protectionists" 
 
Op-ed in business oriented paper Valor Econtmico (9-17) by 
Washington correspondent Ricardo Balthazar states: ".....President 
Obama has been clear that he will always be ready to make 
concessions to protectionist groups if he thinks they are needed to 
strengthen his domestic agenda.....The lack of U.S. leadership in 
the trade area is a serious problem for countries like Brazil, which 
is betting strongly on the successful conclusion of the Doha 
Development Round Trade talks that would eliminate trade barriers 
that impede the progress of Brazil's exporters..."
