¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. As per reftel A request and at the direction of the Office of 
Enforcement Analysis (OEA) of the USDOC Bureau of Industry and 
Security (BIS), Export Control Officer Philip Ankel (ECO), attempted 
to conduct a pre-license check at Xian Jason Electronics Technology, 
Flat K, 14F, World Tech Centre, 95 How Ming Street, Kwun Tong (Xian 
Jason Electronics). The purpose of the visit was to determine the 
suitability of Xian Jason Electronics to be the ultimate consignee 
(but not end user) of various high density programmable logic 
devices that are the subject of export license application D421812. 
The items (ECCN 3A001) are controlled for national security (NS) 
reasons. The license applicant is Benchmark Connector Corp. of 
Sunrise, Florida and the stated end user in the license application 
is Shaanxi Shiyouyiqi Ltd. of Xian, China. 
 
¶3.  A search of the Hong Kong Companies Registry revealed no entry 
for Xian Jason Electronics 
 
¶4. Background research on the web did not uncover any web presence 
for Xian Jason Electronics.  Jason Electronics is a Singapore based 
company (www.jason.com.sg), however, that company's web site does 
not list any mainland China locations. 
 
¶5.  On August 17, 2009, FCS Commercial Assistant Carrie Chan 
attempted to reach the company and arrange a meeting.  A Ms. Lau 
answered the phone.  Ms. Lau declined to identify her company's name 
although she confirmed that the phone number (provided to ECO by 
OEA) corresponds to an electronics trading company in Hong Kong. 
She claimed ignorance of Xian Jason Electronics and expressed her 
frustration that other companies were using her mailing address 
without informing her.  Ms. Lau later stated that she had checked 
with some of her mainland Chinese clients, none of whom stated that 
they knew Jason Electronics.  Ms. Lau further stated that one of 
those clients told her that a friend may have ordered this 
particular part, presumably for delivery to Ms. Lau's business 
address. 
 
¶6.  On August 20, 2009, ECO went to visit the purported address for 
Xian Jason Electronics.  It corresponds to the address for Techpro 
Technology HK Co. Ltd.  That company was the subject of a prior 
unfavorable EUC in which a Ms. Lau from Techpro provided what the 
ECO believes to be false information concerning another, unrelated 
order. 
 
¶7.  Based on the information detailed heren, ECO believes Xian 
Jason Electronics to be an unsuitable recipient of U.S. origin 
controlled commodities.  ECO recommends a close review of all 
shipments to the World Tech Center address noted above as well as 
any shipments to Techpro Technology HK Co. Ltd.
