REF: STATE 96625 
 
¶1. Post delivered reftel demarche to Pablo Yuste, Head of the 
Department of Emergencies and Post-Conflict in the Office of 
Humanitarian Action in the Spanish Agency for International 
Development Aid (AECID).  Yuste stated that Spain was aware 
of the humanitarian crisis in Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya 
and had revised its emergency assistance as a result. 
 
¶2.  Spain is providing 6 million euros in emergency 
assistance to Ethiopia this year (as opposed to 3 million in 
2008); 2.84 million euros to Kenya, and 4 million euros to 
Somalia, for a total of 12,841,260 euros.  Yuste stated that 
this sum when added to GOS emergency donations to Pakistan 
comprises about 23 percent of Spain's total 2009 emergency 
humanitarian aid budget of 116 million euros, and that Spain 
is not in a position to make additional donations at this 
time.
