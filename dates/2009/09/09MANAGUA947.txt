Summary 
------ 
¶1. (C) On August 27, the Ministry of Energy and Mining (MEM) 
revoked the provisional license it issued to U.S. - 
Guatemalan - Nicaragua consortium AMAYO for the installation 
of wind turbines near the Costa Rican border.  MEM announced 
that it had revoked the license because the consortium had 
begun construction before receiving its final generating 
license.  The U.S. partner in the AMAYO consortium, ARCTAS 
Capital Group, contends that the provisional license allows 
for construction and suggest that President Ortega ordered 
the license revoked to make way for Mexican businessman 
Carlos Perlata's interests in wind energy.  GE Energy would 
supply Peralta's 60 megawatt project with turbines.  This 
case may raise issues concerning the Nicaraguan Government's 
obligation under CAFTA-DR to provide minimum standards of 
treatment for AMAYO in its licensing process.  AMAYO has not 
sought our assistance thus far. 
 
Government Revokes License 
-------------------------- 
¶2. (C) On September 11, David Haug, managing director of 
ARCTAS Capital Group, told econoffs that on August 27 MEM 
revoked the provisional license it issued to the AMAYO 
Consortium just a month earlier for the installation of 11 
wind turbines, manufactured by Indian company SULZON, near 
the Costa Rican border.  The turbines were to have generated 
23 megawatts of electricity for the Nicaraguan grid.  Haug 
said the Ministry of Environment and National Resources 
(MARENA) followed suit soon thereafter and revoked AMAYO's 
environmental permit. 
 
¶3. (C) ARCTAS, a U.S. company, owns 47.5% of AMAYO. 
Guatemalan company Centrans Energy Services owns 47.5% and a 
local partner the final 5%.  AMAYO already invested $100 
million to install 19 SULZON wind turbines with a total 
capacity of 40 megawatts on an adjacent property.  This first 
phase is fully licensed and already supplying electricity to 
the national grid.  According to Haug, the provisional 
license issued on July 27 for phase II allowed AMAYO to begin 
installing turbines and make all other necessary preparations 
-- short of connecting to the grid.  In August, AMAYO began 
clearing land and building reinforced concrete pads as part 
of its $60 million investment. 
 
¶4. (C) In a press release, MEM announced that it had revoked 
AMAYO's license because the consortium had begun construction 
before receiving its final generating license.  The Ministry 
cited Article 23 of the 1998 Electricity Law, which, 
according to the release, says "the construction, 
installation, maintenance, and operation of electricity 
generation plants is permitted only for generators that have 
a license, authorized by the Ministry."  Haug pointed out 
that Article 23 in fact states, "the construction, 
installation, maintenance, and operation of electricity 
generation plants is allowed for all economic agents so long 
as it does not pose a danger for persons, property, or the 
environment."  According to Haug, the provisional license 
allows for construction but not generation. 
 
Appeals Process Underway 
------------------------

¶5. (C) AMAYO General Manager Sean Porter told econcouns on 
September 25 that MEM had rejected the consortium's appeal of 
the decision to revoke the provisional license.  Meanwhile, 
AMAYO is paying $11,000 a day in demurrage for equipment in 
the port of Corinto ready to be off loaded and $9,000 a day 
in construction costs.  Despite these setbacks, Porter said 
"hope is not lost," and AMAYO is pursuing all available 
administrative and judicial channels, including a second 
appeal that President Ortega is supposed to hear directly. 
AMAYO also seeks to enlist the support of Investment 
Promotion Delegate Alvaro Baltodano and Presidential Economic 
Advisor Bayardo Arce.  Porter said he would emphasize the 
negative impact this issue is having on the investment 
climate and remind these officials of Nicaragua's commitments 
related to investment included in the U.S. - Central America 
- Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR). 
 
Mexican Businessman Promotes Competing Project
--------------------------------------------- - 

¶6. (C) ARCTAS' Haug told econoffs that competing commercial 
interests -- not any lack of compliance on the part of AMAYO 
-- are behind the government's decision to cancel the license 
for phase II.  He explained that Mexican billionaire Carlos 
Peralta had cultivated a relationship with Humberto and 
Daniel Ortega over the past few years and was interested in 
installing wind turbines to produce 60 MW of electricity at a 
site a few miles away from where the AMAYO project is 
located.  Haug said the Mexican businessman views AMAYO's 
expansion plan as a threat.  If both projects move forward, 
electricity produced by wind in Nicaragua would total 123 MW, 
including 40 MW already produced by phase I of AMAYO, 23 MW 
by phase II, and 60 MW by Peralta.  Industry experts say 
total wind energy production above 100 MW would be unsafe for 
a grid the size of Nicaragua's (about 900 MW total), given 
the inherent uncertainty in the availability of electricity 
generated by wind.  Haug posited that Peralta bribed Ortega 
to cancel the AMAYO concession and make way for the Mexican 
wind turbine project. 
 
GE Energy to Provide Turbines 
----------------------------- 

¶7. (C) Charles Pearson of GE Energy confirmed in a 
conversation with econcouns on September 24 that his company 
was negotiating with Peralta to supply U.S.-made wind 
turbines and equipment for the project.  He made it clear 
that GE Energy would take no equity stake in the Mexican 
project and that his company had no role in the revocation of 
AMAYO's permit.  Pearson acknowledged the possibility that 
bribery played a role in Ortega's decision to cancel the 
AMAYO permit -- in which case GE Energy would withdraw from 
the project -- but he offered other explanations as well. 
Pearson said Ortega may feel he is indebted to Peralta, 
because the Mexican is rumored to have provided financial 
support to Ortega when he was exiled in the 1970s.  He also 
said AMAYO's decision to enlist Cesar Zamora, country manager 
for AEI, to lobby on behalf of the project may have 
backfired.  Pearson said Ortega detests Zamora for his role 
in denouncing electoral fraud in November 2008 when he was 
AmCham president. 
 
Comment 
------- 

¶8. (C) It is difficult to decipher Ortega's motive in 
revoking AMAYO's license.  Bribery, as suggested by ARCTAS, 
is possible, but so are the other explanations offered by GE 
Energy (though less likely in our view).  We have been 
careful not to opine on the topic in our conversations with 
either U.S. company, to avoid the perception that we are 
favoring the interests of one over the other.  The revocation 
of AMAYO's license does indeed raise the issue of the 
Nicaraguan Government's obligation under CAFTA-DR to provide 
minimum standards of treatment for AMAYO in its licensing 
process.  AMAYO has yet to seek assistance from us, but 
should it do so, we will consult with Washington agencies.
