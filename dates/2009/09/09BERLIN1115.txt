¶1. (U)  SUMMARY: The number of confirmed H1N1 infections in 
Germany rose by 146 cases to 17,790 on September 10.  Munich 
International School confirms case(s) of H1N1.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U)  At its September 10 press briefing, the National 
Reference Center for Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute 
(RKI) confirmed a total of 146 new (laboratory and non- 
laboratory) H1N1 cases in Germany over yesterday, increasing 
the total number of H1N1 cases to 17,790.  New cases were 
distributed among all ten federal states as follows: North 
Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) (41), Baden-Wuerttemberg (34), Saxony 
(21), Lower-Saxony (16), Schleswig-Holstein (10), Rhineland- 
Palatinate (8), Saarland (6), Saxony-Anhalt (5), Hesse (4) and 
Thuringia (1). 
 
¶3. (U)  According to RKI, 56 of the total 146 new cases are 
attributed to people returning from travel abroad.  New cases 
include non-laboratory H1N1 cases that exhibited symptoms 
after being in contact with a laboratory-confirmed infected 
person. 
 
¶4. (U)  NRW remains the German state with the highest number 
of confirmed virus cases with a total of 5,429, followed by 
Baden-Wuerttemberg (2,732 cases) and  Lower-Saxony (2,572). 
The number of all confirmed infections in Germany that have 
resulted from domestic transmission increased to 27 percent. 
 
 
School class in Berlin infected with H1N1 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U)  Shortly after the beginning of the new school year, 
first graders at the Cecilien elementary school in Berlin- 
Wilmersdorf were sent home after students had shown flu-like 
symptoms and three tested positive for the new virus.  It 
remains to be seen how long the students will be absent from 
school.  "It takes usually seven days to get over the virus", 
said a spokesperson from the Berlin Senate for Health. 
 
 
Confirmed case of H1N1 at Munich International School 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
 
¶6. (U)  On September 9, Munich International School (MIS) 
confirmed the first case of H1N1.   MIS is the main school for 
USG dependents at Munich, along with Bavarian International. 
As per school protocol, infected students will remain off 
campus until they have been given clearance from their doctors 
to return.  The school is in communication with local health 
authorities and at this point in time they recommend that MIS 
continues to operate school as normal with heightened 
awareness to best hygienic practices.
