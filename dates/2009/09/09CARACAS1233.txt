SUBJECT: RESPONSE TO MAJORS DESIGNATION NEGATIVE 
 
¶1. (SBU) During a September 17 press conference, Venezuelan 
Minister of Interior and Justice Tarek El Aissami gave the 
Venezuelan government (GBRV) response to the Presidential 
Determination for Major Drug-Transit and Major Illicit 
Drug-Producing Countries (the Majors).  El Aissami described 
the Majors report as bordering on "immoral, cynical and 
hypocritical."  Describing U.S. drug control policy as 
"failure after failure," the Minister suggested that the 
United States should, "decertify itself out of shame."  El 
Aissami repeated the charge made by President Chavez on his 
September 13 episode of "Alo Presidente" that the DEA "had 
become the main drug cartel operating in the United States." 
 
¶2.  (SBU) President Chavez, speaking during a September 17 
televised event, admitted not having read the report, and 
added that he would study it carefully to see if Venezuela 
was being accused of supporting drug trafficking.  Chavez 
also announced that he was considering a airplane shoot-down 
policy for Venezuela.  "I don't like the idea," said Chavez, 
"but others have the policy."  Chavez revealed that drug 
pilots ignore or laugh at orders to land from Venezuelan 
authorities.  Chavez warned the "Colombian and Yanqui" drug 
traffickers that he was seriously considering the issue (a 
shoot-down policy). 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Both local and sydnicated press reported Chavez's 
informal comments that he considered the waiver to fund civil 
society groups in Venezuela as funding for opposition groups 
to conspire against him.
