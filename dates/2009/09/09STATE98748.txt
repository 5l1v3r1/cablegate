¶1. (U) This is an action request.  Please see paragraph 3. 
 
------------------ 
SUMMARY/BACKGROUND 
------------------ 
 
¶2. (S/NF) The United States has information that Ecuador is 
coordinating with Iran to open a branch of Iran's Export 
Development Bank of Iran (EBDI) in Ecuador, and that Iran is 
considering extending a line of credit to Ecuador.  The 
Treasury Department designated the EDBI, along with three 
affiliated entities, on October 22, 2008 (ref B).  We are 
concerned that Iran may be attempting to conduct transactions 
to facilitate proliferation-related payment in circumvention 
of UNSCRs 1737, 1747, and 1803. 
 
------------------------ 
OBJECTIVE/ACTION REQUEST 
------------------------ 
 
¶3. (S/NF) As a follow-up to the meeting between Treasury and 
the Embassy of Ecuador in Washington, on May 8, during which 
Treasury first expressed U.S. concerns regarding Iran's 
efforts to promote and enhance bilateral banking cooperation 
with Ecuador, Post is requested to deliver the points in 
paragraph 4 to appropriate host government officials in the 
Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance.  (Note: Treasury 
and State plan to deliver similar points to representatives 
from the Ecuadorian Embassy as well.  End Note.)  Post should 
pursue the following objectives: 
 
-- Highlight the risks involved with doing business with EDBI 
and EDBI-affiliated entities. 
 
-- Warn Ecuador of the risks involved in facilitating 
financial transactions with Iran. 
 
------------------ 
POINTS FOR ECUADOR 
------------------ 
 
¶4. (S//REL TO EC) We would like to raise serious concerns 
regarding planned financial transactions between Iran and 
Ecuador. 
 
-- We have information that Iranian officials are seeking to 
promote and enhance bilateral banking cooperation with 
Ecuador.  We understand that Ecuador is coordinating with 
Iran to open a branch of Iran's Export Development Bank of 
Iran (EBDI) in Ecuador, and that Iran in considering 
extending a line of credit to Ecuador. 
 
-- Treasury designated the EDBI and three affiliated entities 
on October 22, 2008, because EDBI provides financial services 
to multiple subordinate entities of Iran's Ministry of 
Defense and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) that permit these 
entities to advance Iran's WMD programs.  The term 
"designate" means to prohibit U.S. persons or entities from 
engaging in business with such entities.  Treasury also 
designated three separate entities which were found to be 
owned, or controlled by, or acting or purporting to act for 
or on behalf of the EDBI. These entities are: the EDBI Stock 
Brokerage Company and the EDBI Exchange Company, both located 
in Iran, and Banco Internacional de Desarrollo, CA, a 
financial institution located in Venezuela.  This action was 
taken in accordance with Executive Order 13382 ("Blocking the 
Property of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators and 
their Supporters"). 
 
-- Entities associated with Iran's nuclear and missile 
programs utilize an extensive network of front companies to 
conceal the true ownership of funds and end-use of commercial 
goods.  These designations are consistent with obligations in 
UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) 1737, 1747 and 1803, 
which require Member States to freeze the assets of entities 
and individuals designated by the UN Security Council as 
being involved in Iran's nuclear or missile programs, and 
freeze the assets of entities acting on their behalf or at 
their direction. 
 
-- We want to convey to the Ecuadorian government that any 
entity in its jurisdiction found to be conducting business 
with EDBI and its affiliates and any other designated 
entities, or any entity that is owned or controlled by, or 
acting for or on behalf of EDBI and its affiliates, may be 
subject to designation under E.O. 13382. 
 
-- We ask that you take any appropriate measures to prevent 
Iran from circumventing the applicable UN Security Council 
resolutions by accessing your financial system to support its 
nuclear and missile program. 
 
-- We look forward to working with you on this and other 
related security and counterproliferation matters and are 
prepared to provide additional assistance as appropriate.
