REF:  A) Berlin 1096, B) Berlin 1089 and previous. 
 
¶1. (U)  SUMMARY: The number of confirmed H1N1 infections in 
Germany rose by 379 cases to 17,644 on September 9. Germany 
plans to order an additional 18 million courses of H1N1 
vaccine.  END SUMMARY 
 
¶2. (U)  At its September 9 press briefing, the National 
Reference Center for Influenza at the Robert Koch Institute 
(RKI) confirmed a total of 379 new (laboratory and non- 
laboratory) H1N1 cases in Germany over yesterday, increasing 
the total number of H1N1 cases to 17,644.  New cases were 
distributed among all twelve federal states as follows: North 
Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) (150), Baden-Wuerttemberg (50), Hesse 
(48), Bavaria (47), Lower-Saxony (25), Saxony-Anhalt (15), 
Berlin (11), Rhineland-Palatinate (6), Saarland (6), Bremen 
(5), Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (5) and Hamburg (1). 
 
¶3. (U)  According to RKI, 183 of the total 379 new cases are 
attributed to people returning from travel abroad.  New cases 
include non-laboratory H1N1 cases that exhibited symptoms 
after being in contact with a laboratory-confirmed infected 
person. 
 
¶4. (U)  NRW remains the German state with the highest number 
of confirmed virus cases with a total of 5,388,  followed by 
Baden-Wuerttemberg (2,698 cases) and  Lower-Saxony (2,556). 
The number of all confirmed infections in Germany that have 
resulted from domestic transmission is 26 percent. 
 
 
Germany to order additional A/H1N1 vaccine 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U)  Germany plans to place a second order of A/H1N1 
vaccine.  State-level health ministers agreed on September 7 
in Berlin to order an additional 18 million courses of the 
vaccine against the new flu.  In July, Germany made a first 
order of 50 million courses (two doses per course for each 
person) for vaccination of 30 percent of the population (25 
million people). With the additional order, Germany would be 
able to provide vaccination to a total of 34 million people, 
representing about 41 percent of the population.
