1.(C) On September 23, Economic-Political Minister-Counselor delivered reftel points on the Goldstone Report to MFA Deputy Assistant Minister for Human Rights Wael Aboulmagd, and separately to MFA Deputy Assistant Minister for the Americas Amin Meleka. Regarding USG principles for a balanced UN Human Rights Council (HRC) resolution (reftel), Aboulmagd identified three elements that he anticipated would be problematic for the GOE: noting the report without endorsing it, the definition of a "balanced" HRC resolution, and recognizing a state's right to legitimate self-defense.

2.(C) Aboulmagd explained that the GOE views the conflict as having been one-sided, so there would need to be discussions on what a balanced resolution would entail. He said the GOE is not certain that the issue of a state's legitimate self-defense is relevant to a HRC resolution. Aboulmagd noted that this was an initial response, and that the GOE is still studying the report. Scobey
