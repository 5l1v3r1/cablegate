Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (C) Ruling DPJ Diet member and Yukio Hatoyama confidante 
Yorihisa Matsuno told Embassy Tokyo September 4 that the 
presumptive next Prime Minister's ""first priority"" will be to 
establish a close relationship with the United States and 
President Obama.  To that end, Hatoyama had already turned 
down an invitation to visit China, arguing that ""I need to 
visit the United States first,"" Matsuno relayed.  Matsuno 
also discussed Afghanistan and the Indian Ocean refueling 
mission and described Hatoyama's dislike of the Socialists, 
the possible domestic function of the National Strategy 
Bureau, the prominent role of Ichiro Ozawa as DPJ Secretary 
General and the low chances that the Hatoyama administration 
will make a bilateral issue of the so-called ""secret nuclear 
pact"" from 40 years ago.  End Summary. 
 
Close U.S. Relationship is First Priority 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (C) DPJ Diet member and Hatoyama confidante Yorihisa 
Matsuno told Embassy Tokyo Poloff  September 4 that DPJ 
President Hatoyama is ""very pro-U.S.,"" but that his view on 
the United States and U.S.-Japan relationship had been skewed 
in the recent op-ed piece that ran in the New York Times. 
Matsuno said that under Hatoyama, the DPJ government's ""first 
priority"" will be to build a close relationship with the 
United States and President Obama, followed by achieving the 
promises related to domestic matters the party made in its 
manifesto, such as increasing the child allowance. 
 
¶3. (C) Hatoyama understands well the importance of the United 
States to Japan, Matsuno continued.  For example, China 
recently already offered Hatoyama an invitation to visit 
before Hatoyama's trip to the United States, but Hatoyama 
declined.  Matsuno relayed that Hatoyama told him that 
""President Obama has to be the first foreign leader I meet."" 
Hatoyama is truly looking forward to meeting President Obama 
in the U.S., Matsuno said.  Matsuno was also very happy to 
see that Hatoyama and Ambassador Roos ""hit it off"" during 
their September 3 meeting.  Matsuno assessed that Hatoyama 
should have a direct channel to the Ambassador because the 
quickest way for Hatoyama to understand U.S. thinking is to 
communicate directly with the Ambassador. 
 
Afghanistan and Refueling Mission 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (C) On Afghanistan and the refueling issue, Matsuno 
explained that the DPJ first needs to understand ""what the 
United States wants and needs.""  Matsuno argued that U.S. 
desiderata for Afghan reconstruction ""must have changed"" from 
the Bush administration to the Obama administration. 
Furthermore, while it is important to understand the needs of 
Afghanistan and Pakistan, the DPJ still needs to understand 
what the United States would have Japan do, Matsuno 
explained.  He further emphasized that humanitarian 
assistance, rather than military assistance involving Japan's 
Self-Defense Forces, would be easier for the DPJ 
administration to pursue, considering its likely coalition 
relationship with Socialists.  In any case, the Hatoyama 
administration will need to understand U.S. ""needs"" first, 
and then discuss how the two countries can cooperate. 
 
Relationship with the Socialists 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (C) On the DPJ's relationship with the Social Democratic 
Party (SDP), Matsuno clearly stated that Hatoyama ""wants to 
get rid of any SDP presence in a coalition government as soon 
as possible.""  He believes that the SDP's influence in the 
coalition government would be very limited, as it only has 
seven seats in the Lower House.  While true that the DPJ 
needs the SDP in the Upper House in order to have a majority 
there, ""once the DPJ gets a majority in the Upper House, the 
relationship with the SDP is over,"" Matsuno stressed.  For 
now, the SDP will need to voice loudly its policy positions 
in order to ""prove that it is still alive,"" but that does not 
mean the party will have significant influence on government 
management and policy decisions, Matsuno explained.

National Strategy Bureau 
------------------------ 
 
¶6. (C) Matsuno said that the focus of the DPJ-proposed 
National Strategy Bureau will be on domestic issues.  The new 
organization, to be headed by Deputy Prime Minister (and 
seasoned bureaucrat basher) Naoto Kan, will cover some 
foreign and national security policy issues, but these will 
be limited and ""most of the attention will be paid to 
domestic-focused ministries and their budgets and personnel"" 
Matsuno said. 
 
DPJ Secretary General Ozawa 
--------------------------- 
 
¶7. (C) Matsuno said frankly that there were pros and cons to 
appointing former DPJ Party President Ichiro Ozawa as 
Secretary General.  However, it is undeniable that Ozawa 
alone succeeded in getting 150 new DPJ members elected.  The 
DPJ needs these members to be re-elected next time around, 
and Ozawa is the only person capable of doing this.  He is 
also the only politician able to ""keep in line"" such a large 
group of first-termers. 
 
""Secret Agreement"" and Three Non-Nuclear Principles 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶8. (C) On the issue of the so-called ""secret agreement"" (from 
40 years ago) between the United States and Japan to allow 
ships with nuclear weapons to pass through Japanese straits 
and enter ports, Matsuno said the DPJ's intention is ""not to 
make this an issue with the United States.""  The DPJ 
understands that the USG has already disclosed the relevant 
information and publicly stated that the documents speak for 
themselves.  ""The problem is MOFA,"" Matsuno said.  MOFA has 
tried to hide the existence of the agreement, and therefore 
the DPJ has to pursue this.  ""It is not about the United 
States,"" he stressed. 
 
¶9. (C) On the possibility of legislating Japan's three 
non-nuclear principles (no production, possession or 
introduction), Matsuno said he was personally against it. 
Obviously, as President Obama said, our ultimate goal should 
be the elimination of nuclear weapons.  That said, Matsuno 
predicted that the legislation of the three principles ""will 
not happen anytime soon.""  The DPJ is realistic about this, 
he added. 
 
Bio Note 
-------- 
 
¶10. (C) Matsuno is a 4th term Diet member from Kumamoto 1st 
district. His father, Raizo Matsuno, was former Prime 
Minister Shigeru Yoshida's secretary and served as Labor 
Minister, Defense Agency head, and Agriculture Minister in 
the Kishi and Sato Cabinets, and had senior party jobs in the 
Miki Cabinet.  Matsuno Jr. started his political career as a 
staffer in the New Frontier Party, then became a secretary to 
former PM Morihiro Hosokawa.  Matsuno succeeded Hosokawa in 
his district and was first elected in 2000.  Because 
Matsuno's father and Hatoyama's grandfather and father were 
close politically, Matsuno and Hatoyama are themselves close. 
 Matsuno is considered one of a small handful Diet members 
who have Hatoyama's ear on political and policy issues.
