SUBJECT:  EXBS RUSSIA MONTHLY REPORTING CABLE 
AUGUST 2009 
 
Summary:  This cable highlights activities of the Export Control and 
Related Border Security (EXBS) Russia Program Office for the period 
of August 01, 2009 to August 31, 2009.  End Summary 
 
¶1.  On August 21st, the EXBS Advisor and EXBS Assistant had a very 
constructive, positive meeting with the export controls section 
within the Security and Disarmament Department of the Russian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  MFA had contacted the Federal 
Customs Service, the Ministry of Defense, the federal export 
licensing authority (FSTEK), and the federal space agency Roskosmos 
beforehand for comments and program suggestions.  Some suggestions 
and ideas were entirely new, while others were developed from prior 
conversations we had held with these agencies and with MFA.  As a 
result, significant progress was made on the following items: 
affirmation of continued US-Russia export controls cooperation; 
approval for three Russian government professionals to attend an 
export controls/nonproliferation course at the University of Georgia 
Athens in late October; agreement in principle to continue trade 
controls training for Russian government officials; approval to 
conduct a seminar on export controls violations enforcement; and 
endorsement of an exchange of US and Russian export controls 
(dual-use) licensing officials.  This last item is a noteworthy 
development, in that it represents the first time that EXBS will 
work directly with FSTEK on an activity. 
 
¶2.  MFA also reiterated its strong desire to resume export controls 
Program Reviews, the last of which was held in 2007.  EXBS in Moscow 
is coordinating dates, participants, location (Washington or Moscow) 
and agenda items with the MFA and the State Department in 
Washington. 
 
¶3.  In stating the MFA list of major export controls and 
nonproliferation issues of interest to the US, Mr. Alexander 
Mikhailovich Deineko, the head of the section, mentioned that he and 
his colleagues would be very busy with meetings and other activities 
related to UNSCR 1540 for most of the fall.  He asked us for details 
about the proposed revision to the US export control system, 
specifically about the review of US trade controls on dual-use items 
launched by California Congressman Howard Berman and his plans to 
introduce a new Export Administration Act next year.  Congressman 
Berman had visited Moscow in late June as part of a delegation of 
lawmakers to discuss a variety of US-Russian strategic issues.  We 
told Mr. Deineko that we would convey his request through the 
appropriate channels. 
 
¶4.  Another notable development at the meeting was the addition of 
two new staff members.  We were rather surprised to see the senior 
of the two, Mr. Anatoliy Mikhailovich Bulochnikov, as an MFA 
employee.  We have known him for many years as the founder of the 
Center for Export Controls (CEC), the Russian partner of 
Commonwealth Trading Partners, which conducted a series of trade 
controls seminars throughout Russia for Customs and industry. 
 
¶5.  The EXBS team is working closely with a Customs and Border 
Protection (CBP) delegation that will travel to Moscow to deliver a 
new course in Supply Chain Security to Russian Customs.  The course 
will take place September 15-17.  The following week the delegation 
will travel to St. Petersburg for meetings with Customs officials to 
help set up training they have requested for operators in Advanced 
Non-Intrusive Inspection (NII) techniques.  This training will take 
place towards the end of the year. 
 
¶6.  Following up on the exchange of best practices offered at the 
June EXBS Advisor's Meeting in Tbilisi, the EXBS Advisor and 
Assistant received an expert tutorial on the COAST system from the 
Senior Financial Management Officer at the embassy.  This training 
will help us to track and record program expenses in a more 
efficient and timely manner.
