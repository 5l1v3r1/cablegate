¶1.  NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT 
 
"The U.S. and UK actively promote 'a world free of nuclear weapons'" 
 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(09/24)(pg 16): "According to a recent poll, 
the Chinese people have serious doubts about the attitudes of the 
U.S. and the UK on disarmament.  China does not need to participate 
in this process.  Some scholars believe that China should not follow 
the U.S.'s lead, and should instead continue to develop nuclear 
weapons.  However, other scholars believe that eliminating nuclear 
weapons will ultimately benefit China.  Shi Xiamin, an expert on 
nuclear non-proliferation, said that major Western countries are 
currently promoting nuclear disarmament out of practical 
considerations, so that, for example, Russia will temporarily not 
threaten the West.  Western powers are also concerned that small 
countries will use nuclear weapons irresponsibly.  If disarmament is 
not done reasonably, then it will be unfair.  Professor Li Daguang 
at the National Defense University argued that since the U.S. has an 
absolute advantage in terms of its conventional weapons 
capabilities, nuclear weapons have become a big threat for the U.S. 
This is the real reason why the U.S. is promoting nuclear 
disarmament." 
 
"Obama's proposal is only the first step towards a nuclear 
weapons-free world" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(09/24)(pg 14): "Obama's proposal of 'a world 
free of nuclear weapons' could be a turning point in the history of 
nuclear weapons.  However, it is difficult to gain the world's trust 
in such a short period of time and there are still many 
uncertainties.  The U.S. and Russia are still global, nuclear 
superpowers, and denuclearization will be a long process since it is 
difficult to build up mutual trust.  Denuclearization will also 
greatly influence China, which has in fact experienced more rewards 
than risks from the nuclear weapons it possesses.  However, in the 
long run, a world free of nuclear weapons will be beneficial for 
China since the area neighboring China faces a serious risk of 
nuclear proliferation.  China will make efforts to promote the 
denuclearization process, but will only destroy its last nuclear 
weapon when the U.S. and Russia destroy theirs." 
 
¶2.  TIRE TRADE 
 
"President Hu raised 'four points'; Obama responded to tire 
friction" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao) (09/24)(pg 3): 
"In his meeting with Obama, President Hu Jintao raised four issues: 
first, maintaining close, high-level exchanges between the U.S. and 
China; second, continuing to work on the issues discussed at this 
year's S&ED; third, deepening cooperation on major international and 
regional issues; and fourth, strengthening cultural and educational 
exchanges.  When compared to their first meeting in London, the 
content of the talks between the two leaders shows a trend towards 
addressing more tangible issues.  China directly warned the U.S. 
concerning the tire trade issue.  In his response, Obama downplayed 
the issue, indicating that he wants to keep the dispute within 
certain parameters. " 
 
¶3.  U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
"U.S. accuses former Air Force Lieutenant Colonel of selling 
information to China" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(09/24)(pg 3): "Doctor Zhao Guojun at the 
Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences' International Studies Research 
Center said that as China's strength increases the West increasingly 
sees China as its main intelligence target overseas.  However, the 
truth and value of so-called classified information has been 
generally ignored.  In fact, the U.S. is the country that most 
actively spies on others, and yet it still likes to accuse other 
countries of these activities and has a double standard on this 
issue.  This fact has been largely ignored due to China's 
low-profile style and weaker voice relative to the U.S. in the 
international community."
