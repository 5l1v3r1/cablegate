  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  U.S.-CHINA MILITARY RELATIONS 
 
"If U.S. insists on following its own course, there may be 
conflicts" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(09/08)(pg 24): "In recent years, the U.S. has 
conducted frequent military surveillance operations near coastal 
areas of China.  According to the U.S. media, a new type of spy 
plane, the EP-8, will soon replace the old EP-3.  Since the EP-8 has 
much more sophisticated capabilities than the EP-3, these U.S. 
military activities will surely encounter strong opposition from 
China.  China has urged the U.S. to reduce, and even stop, its 
constant air and sea surveillance operations in China's exclusive 
economic zone.  The U.S. Embassy's (in Beijing) Spokesperson, Susan 
Stevenson, confirmed China's request, but stated that the U.S. 
position has not changed.  Experts argue that the U.S.'s 
surveillance operations will increase the likelihood of China-U.S. 
conflicts.  The U.S. should first 'discipline' itself, and then 
promote military cooperation with China." 
 
¶2.  CHINA'S DIPLOMACY 
 
"China must grasp the opportunity provided by other countries' 
strategic retreat" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(09/08)(pg 14): "Due to the impact of the 
financial crisis on the global balance of power, the East-West issue 
has become less important than the North-South issue.  The financial 
crisis has offered China and other newly-emerging countries an 
opportunity to play a more important political and economic role in 
the world.  The financial crisis has greatly decreased overseas 
demand for Chinese goods, which has in fact given China an 
opportunity to adjust its economic structure and increase domestic 
demand.  China should make good use of the current conflicts and 
shifting balances of power in the international community to gain a 
strategic advantage for as long as possible.  Whether or not China 
can grasp this opportunity will depend on how China solves its own 
issues.  The primary issue for China to solve is the ten unbalanced 
aspects of China's social development." 
 
¶3.  AFGHANISTAN 
 
"U.S. facing a dilemma in Afghanistan" 
 
The official intellectual publication Guangming Daily (Guangming 
Ribao)(09/08)(pg 8): "The Afghan election, which has been described 
as the most democratic presidential election in Afghan's history, is 
facing a dilemma.  The current President, Hamid Karzai, has taken 
the lead amid continuous complaints about the election from various 
parties in the country.  For the U.S., which eagerly wants to get 
out of the war in Afghanistan, the election results are crucial. 
Western publics believe Karzai's political performance has been 
mediocre; the White House believes Karzai is not as obedient as 
before; and U.S. politicians agree that Karzai is not the 
appropriate candidate to effectively implement the Obama 
administration's new strategy.  Another presidential candidate, 
Abdullah Abdullah, seems to curry more favor in the U.S. than 
Karzai.  However, if Karzai wins the election, Abdullah may call for 
street battles to fight against the Karzai government.  Thus, the 
election will become the prelude to an Afghan civil war.  As a 
result, Afghanistan will become even more chaotic, leading to a 
complete failure of Obama's new Afghanistan strategy.  The Afghan 
elections are at their most critical stage.  No matter what the 
result is the U.S. has to make a choice: either support Karzai or 
face the collapse of the anti-Taliban alliance.  This will be a 
critical test for Obama's new strategy."
