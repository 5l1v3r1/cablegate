SUBJECT: POSSIBLE FUNDING IMPLICATIONS OF HUMANITARIAN AGENCIES PLAN 
TO RELOCATE PROGRAMTIC FUNCTIONS FROM ABECHE 
 
¶1. (U) This is an USAID/OFDA reporting cable drafted by 
OFDA/Khartoum TDY Oumar M'Bareck and OFDA/Washington TDY George 
Siasoco.  Post thanks OFDA for their close collaboration during this 
visit.

SUMMARY 
- - - - 
 
¶2. (SBU) OFDA discussions in N'Djamena and Abeche with humanitarian 
international organizations (IOs) and non-governmental organizations 
(NGOs) indicates a broad intention of many organizations to relocate 
programmatic functions out of Abeche -- long the hub of humanitarian 
activities in Eastern Chad -- and into the capital, N'Djamena.  The 
relocation is motivated by (a) the joint USG-ECHO donor mission to 
Chad in early 2009, which recommended that IOs (particularly UNHCR) 
reorganize to improve field capabilities and coordination from 
headquarters; (b) the increasing burden placed on Abeche and its 
population of a growing mass of humanitarian and MINURCAT 
functionaries; and (c) the growing threat of increased criminality 
that this community and its activities seems to catalyze.   Although 
the planned moves of several large organizations that receive 
significant USG financing may have funding and program implications, 
most entities report that they do not yet have a clear plan for 
operations, and preparations remain ongoing.  END SUMMARY.

ABECHE: THE END OF A STORY

¶3. (SBU) In a mid-October meeting with USAID's Office of U.S. 
Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA), UN Office for the 
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) representatives 
confirmed that humanitarian agencies intend to relocate from Abeche, 
Ouaddai Region in eastern Chad, to the Chadian capital N'Djamena to 
support increased humanitarian coordination.  Although the planned 
move may have funding and program implications, OCHA reported that 
planning remains ongoing. 
 
¶4. (SBU) In a separate meeting on October 18, a representative from 
non-governmental organization (NGO) Solidarites told USAID/OFDA 
staff that NGOs in eastern Chad have decided to relocate from Abeche 
to N'Djamena in early 2010.  Solidarites noted active UN advocacy 
supporting the move and hopes that a single coordination mechanism 
based in N'Djamena would make humanitarian meetings more fruitful 
and streamline humanitarian response operations.  Solidarites staff 
noted that several organizations are under-represented or not 
represented at decision-making levels in Abeche, which complicates 
attempts to finalize and implement action plans during Abeche 
humanitarian meetings. 
 
¶5. (SBU) In addition, USAID implementing partner Action Contre la 
Faim (ACF) reported that only two NGOs have active programs around 
Abeche area, and most agencies are using the town as logistic hub 
rather than a programmatic center.  Although ACF plans to maintain 
its presence in Abeche, the organization appreciates that other 
humanitarian aid agencies will move operations elsewhere.  ACF 
reported that humanitarian staff can access key project areas 
including Goz Beida, Guereda, Iriba, and Bahai directly from 
N'Djamena, aircraft availability permitting. 
 
¶6. (SBU) Following a recent increase in banditry and attacks on 
humanitarian staff and facilities in Abeche town, NGO and UN staff 
are seeking ways to minimize incidents with relocation to the 
capital, where they evidently believe international and local 
protection mechanisms are superior. Abeche relief staff also note, 
however, that the shift of humanitarian operations from Abeche may 
have additional impacts, particularly because the city population 
had doubled in the past few years due to job opportunities that the 
humanitarian presence created.  With the pending relocation of 
programmatic humanitarian operations and staff, local support staff 
and businesses will suffer heavily.  Despite the current robust 
humanitarian presence in Abeche, ACF and other NGOs commented that 
the organizations have provided little support to the Abeche host 
communities, in part because the majority of humanitarian efforts 
focused on refugees and IDPs located in the volatile border region. 
Despite a lack of direct humanitarian assistance, the local 
population of Abeche has benefited significantly from a robust 
market and local commerce supported by the aid agencies, and the 
 
NDJAMENA 00000481  002 OF 002 
 
 
move will leave a large gap in the local economy and markets. 
 
¶7. (SBU) At recent meetings, staff from several UN agencies reported 
that the decision for a wide-scale humanitarian relocation from 
Abeche to N'Djamena has already been taken and relocation is 
imminent.  In a meeting with USAID/OFDA staff, an OCHA 
representative downplayed the move's potential consequences on local 
populations, and confirmed that OCHA and other UN cluster lead 
agencies plan to reinforce their field presence as a supplement to 
the move (NOTE: OCHA currently has sub-offices in Abeche, Goz Beida, 
Koukou, and Farchana.  END NOTE).  In addition, the OCHA 
representative viewed the move as an opportunity for humanitarian 
agencies to utilize one holistic country team coordination mechanism 
and better visibility on the country-wide needs in Chad.

¶8. (SBU) USAID/OFDA officers note that although many NGOs and UN 
staff confirmed their intentions to relocate staff from Abeche, the 
humanitarian community appears to have undertaken very little 
planning for the operation.  Although staff anticipate a complete 
relocation by mid-2010, humanitarian actors currently remain unable 
to provide financial implications or information for donors, or 
projections of the overall consequences on the livelihoods, 
population, and security of Abeche area. 
 
¶9. (SBU) In addition, USAID/OFDA staff note the importance of 
programmatic considerations and subsequent changes that the move 
will require.  For example, current UN Humanitarian Air Service 
(UNHAS) operations include two daily flights to Abeche from 
N'Djamena, moving cargo and humanitarian aid workers.  Any 
significant move or future changes should involve wide-scale 
planning coordination with the host government, as well as consensus 
from the international donor community and implementing partners 
regarding new destinations, needs, and programs.
