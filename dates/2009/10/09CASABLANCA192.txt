¶1.  (SBU) Summary: With a controlling stake in some of Africa's 
largest banks and solid 2010 earning projections, China is 
increasingly turning to Morocco's largest banks - Attijariwafa and 
Banque Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur (BMCE) - for its banking 
needs in Francophone Africa.  To secure its influence with Morocco's 
banking institutions, China has implemented a dual approach, which 
entails awarding sizeable nearly interest-free loans to Morocco's 
largest banks and providing them with fiscal incentives to open 
branches in China.  While Morocco's banks have benefited financially 
from its rapprochement with China, some remain uneasy about growing 
Sino-Moroccan relations. End Summary.

Just the Beginning 
------------------ 
 
 
¶2.  (SBU) With a controlling stake in some of Africa's largest banks 
(REF A) and solid 2010 earning projections, China is increasingly 
turning to Morocco's largest banks - Attijariwafa and Banque 
Marocaine du Commerce Exterieur (BMCE) - for its banking needs in 
French-speaking Africa.  Present in more than 20 countries in 
sub-Saharan Africa, Morocco's BMCE and Attijariwafa have become the 
preferred alternative for Chinese firms operating in Africa, said 
Taoufik Joundy, President of the Morocco-China Business Council in 
Casablanca.  (Note: Much of the money pouring in from China is tied 
to exploitation of oil and non-oil commodities such as timber, 
copper, and minerals.  End Note.)  "I don't think it boils down to 
just raw commodities. It is much bigger than that now. This is the 
beginning of a strategic partnership", argues Joundy. 
 
 
¶3.  (SBU) With more African countries opening their economies to 
foreign investment, many in Morocco's banking community believe 
Africa is a burgeoning economic opportunity.  More so than other 
Moroccan investors, Younes Benjelloun, CEO of BMCE is aggressively 
expanding in the continent, with the end goal of being present in 
most of Africa's 54 countries.  Asked about China's growing 
relationship with Morocco's banking institutions, he commented, "if 
managed well, Morocco can extract a lot from its relationship with 
China".

China's Approach to Securing the Partnership 
-------------------------------------------- 
 
 
¶4.  (SBU) To secure its influence with Morocco's largest banks, 
China has developed a dual strategy, which entails awarding large, 
nearly interest-free loans to Morocco's banks and providing them 
with fiscal incentives to open branches in China. First, it has 
awarded several long-term concessional loans to Moroccan banks 
through the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), one of 
the world's largest banks.  Presently, BMCE is securing several 
major lending deals with ICBC, confided BMCE's Corporate Office 
Director, M'fadel El Halaissi. (Please strictly protect this 
sensitive commercial information.) While El Halaissi declined to 
share specific data, he added that the loans were "very sizeable." 
 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Second, to attract Morocco's largest banks to Beijing, 
China is providing them with fiscal incentives, including a 
corporate tax holiday during the first five years of business and a 
tax rate of 15 percent thereafter.  (Comment: The incentives are 
more than likely a Chinese strategy to increase its access into 
Africa. End Comment.)  BMCE's branch in Beijing is also a tribute to 
the lobbying done by high-level official visitors to Morocco, said 
El Halaissi.  Not to be outdone, a well placed source in 
Attijariwafa told Econoff that Attijariwafa will soon open a branch 
in Shanghai.

Assessing the Benefits of China's Ties to Morocco 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
 
¶6.  (SBU) China's relationship with Morocco elicits mixed 
sentiments.  On the one hand, the GOM and Morocco's banking 
institutions have benefited financially from the nascent partnership 
with China in Africa.  On the other hand, economists like Jawad 
Kerdoudi of the International Institute for International Relations 
(IMRI), a Casablanca based think-tank, remain uneasy about China's 
growing relationship with Morocco. He queried: "Is China bringing 
trade and investment that Africa so badly needs, or just meddling 
and exploitation? I really don't know."  "All partnerships, whether 
healthy or not, bring risks," Kerdoudi commented. 
 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Similarly, BMCE is proceeding with caution.  While its 
relationship with China is strong, it has declined other offers from 
ICBC, including one which entailed buying a significant share of 
BMCE Capital, confided El Halaissi.  BMCE's commitment to Africa is 
long-term and as such the bank has to be careful about the 
implications of its partnerships, he added. 
 
 
¶8.  (SBU) COMMENT: Despite concerns in some quarters about the 
burgeoning relationship between China and Morocco's banks, the 
Kingdom's involvement with China in Africa is likely to continue to 
expand.  Moroccan bankers say they will be vigilant to ensure that 
they can get a fair deal from the partnership.  If so, in their 
view, both Morocco and China can be winners.
