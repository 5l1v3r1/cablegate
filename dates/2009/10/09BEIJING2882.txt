  Editorial Quotes 
-------------------- 
 
¶1.  NORTH KOREA 
 
"U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Campbell visits China to find a 
path for Obama to resume Six-Party Talks" 
 
The Shanghai-based Shanghai Media Group (SMG) publication, China 
Business News (Diyi Caijing)(02/03)(pg A16): "On whether the U.S. is 
in favor of an "East Asian Community" excluding the United States, 
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Campbell said that in this regard, 
the United States has a set of principles; first of all, the United 
States should be involved in any critical dialogues relating to 
security, economic and business issues.  For the Six-Party Talks, 
Campbell said that China believes North Korea will agree to return 
to the Six-Party Talks process, but is still not sure how firm North 
Korea's commitment is.  The U.S. needs to further test North Korea's 
stance.  Campbell insisted the U.S. will not agree to have direct 
talks with North Korea if the promises of prior Six-Party Talks 
agreements cannot be met.  He also mentioned the possibility of 
U.S.-North Korea bilateral talks which the U.S. could initiate and 
which could possibly accelerate the resumption of the Six-Party 
Talks.  China and the U.S. have reached a consensus that the 
Six-Party Talks framework is critical, and within this framework any 
form of bilateral, trilateral or any other forms of talks are 
possible." 
 
¶2.  SCO 
 
"Create a useful Shanghai Cooperation Organization" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(10/15)(pg 2): 
"In the past, China stood firmly on the principle of a consistent 
stance through negotiations with other members of the organization, 
sometimes sacrificing its own interests to go along with the 
majority. However, continuing in this way, China's opinion can 
hardly been properly reflected by the organization and a common view 
about its future development can hardly be reached between the 
member countries.  The fact that China has adjusted its foreign 
policy to meet the challenges of the financial crisis can be seen in 
the recent SCO sessions.  Experts believe China is like the chief 
violin for the organization now and sets the basic tone for its 
future development.  The Shanghai Cooperation Organization, as the 
only international organization in which China plays a dominant 
role, serves also as an important reference for China to further 
integrate itself in and participate in the construction of the 
international system.  It is the best testing ground for China to 
implement its multilateral diplomacy." 
 
¶3.  RMB APPRECIATION 
 
"The global economic recovery should first allow the U.S. dollar to 
stabilize" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(pg 15): "A stable RMB is the primary issue 
for China right now although U.S. and European trade protectionism 
sentiment has been rising.  Whenever a western economy deteriorates, 
the RMB exchange rate will always become a target of protectionists. 
 The attempt to weaken the competitiveness of Chinese products 
through altering the exchange rate, increasing exports to China and 
decreasing imports from China is simply disguised trade 
protectionism.  Currently, what the U.S. needs to do is stabilize 
the U.S. dollar and take responsibility for the global economic 
recovery.  In fact, China has been actively promoting the reform of 
the marketing of RMB exchange rates.  Currently if China does not 
stabilize the RMB, the West's plot to let China pay the cost of the 
financial crisis will become a reality.  While the global economy is 
still in recession, the U.S. should strengthen economic cooperation 
and make great efforts to stabilize the U.S. dollar, the main 
reserve currency, and avoid putting further pressure on the RMB 
exchange rate."
