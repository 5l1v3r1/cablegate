REF: STATE 106423 
 
(SBU) On October 15, PolOff met with MFA International 
Organizations official Nguyen Thi Thu Quyhn to urge Vietnam to 
support the U.S. position on the Goldstone report.  PolOff briefed 
Quyhn on the latest developments, described reftel, and encouraged 
Vietnam's missions in Geneva and New York to coordinate closely 
with their U.S. counterparts.  She stressed the potential damage 
both to the Human Rights Council and to ongoing efforts to 
re-launch permanent status negotiations if the matter were not 
handled appropriately.  Quyhn promised to relay the substance of 
the demarche to her supervisors and to officials in New York and 
Geneva.  She stated that Vietnam currently had no plans to make a 
statement on the report either at the UNSC or UNHRC, but wanted to 
remain "balanced, unbiased and objective."  She said that if there 
were some sort of vote on the Goldstone Report, Vietnam would 
likely join consensus in an effort to support solutions acceptable 
to the majority of voting members.
