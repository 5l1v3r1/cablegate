SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (10/16): Hamas continues to stall 
the national reconciliation process 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The dailies prominently report on today's UN Human Rights Council 
(UNHRC) session to discuss the Goldstone report. In response to 
remarks by Israeli Ambassador to the UN Gabriela Shalev stating that 
Israel will boycott any peace talks if the report is not withdrawn, 
Palestinian Authority (PA) Ambassador to the UN Ibrahim Khreisheh 
noted that the PA is not concerned about a peace process that is 
based on continued settlement activity, the building of the 
separation wall, and adoption of collective punishment policies 
against the Palestinian people. 
 
The local press continues to report on national reconciliation. 
Azzam Al-Ahmad submitted Fatah's approval of the Egyptian proposal 
yesterday to Egyptian Chief of Intelligence Omar Suleiman. The 
reports note that Hamas has requested two to three more days before 
submitting their response. The Palestinian factions based in 
Damascus said that they won't sign the agreement unless it 
recognizes the Palestinians' right of resistance, according to 
coverage. 
 
PA President Mahmoud Abbas's remarks during a joint press conference 
with Spanish Prime Minister Jose Zapatero received prominent 
coverage in the local press. Abbas stated that the Palestinian 
elections will be held according to the basic law in January 2010 
unless national reconciliation is successful, in which case the 
elections will be held in June 2010. 
 
Citing the Israeli daily Yediot, the local press highlights news 
that after its failure to reach an agreement to freeze settlement 
activity and announce the resumption of negotiations, the US plans 
to move directly to final status negotiations. The report notes that 
the US will invite the Palestinians and Israelis to the US to 
discuss the crucial issues, including Jerusalem, borders and 
security. In related coverage, the reports note that Special Envoy 
George Mitchell met with an Israeli delegation in Washington 
yesterday and discussed ways to re-launch negotiations.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title "Who 
is deceiving the Palestinian people?" (10/16): "The Palestinian 
leadership and political factions are responsible for deceiving the 
Palestinian people. The Palestinians dream about national 
reconciliation, but no one knows who is responsible for the failure 
of the reconciliation thus far. Is it Hamas or Fatah? Whom should we 
believe? The factions fight and the people pay the price." 
 
2) Samih Shbeib opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the title 
"Hamas and the closed prospects" (10/16): "Hamas will not approve of 
holding national presidential and legislative elections. In fact 
they see no need to hold the elections because they won't be elected 
again. In the coming days, we will see that Hamas is creating many 
obstacles and problems with Egypt to hinder the national 
reconciliation."
