SUBJECT: OSCE PERMANENT COUNCIL:  CONTINGENCY STATEMENT ON 
GEORGIA 
 
Â¶1. (U) Post is authorized to draw from the following 
statement at the October 15 meeting of the OSCE Permanent 
Council if the Tagliavini Report is raised. 
 
Begin text: 
 
Thank you, Madam Chair. 
 
We note that the report cited today was produced by an 
independent commission whose findings are solely its own.  My 
government is carefully reviewing those findings.  Like other 
OSCE partners, we are focused on efforts to achieve a 
long-term, peaceful resolution to the conflict, and to 
develop better mechanisms for preventing and resolving crises. 
 
As we look to the future, we must seek to address a number of 
outstanding concerns.  More than a year after the war in 
Georgia, the security situation remains tense, and civilians 
continue to suffer.  We must urge Russia to fulfill the 
provisions of the August 12 and September 8 agreements, 
including the return of Russian troops to pre-war positions 
and finally granting unhindered humanitarian access to 
Georgia,s separatist regions.  We encourage all concerned 
parties to participate constructively in the Geneva 
discussions and related mechanisms to rapidly address mutual 
issues of concern.  We must ensure the continued involvement 
of the international community, and seek to establish an 
international presence in the Georgian regions of South 
Ossetia and Abkhazia.  We appreciate the tireless efforts of 
the Greek Chairmanship and Special Representative 
Christopoulos in this regard, and remain committed to OSCE's 
continued involvement in Georgia. 
 
In addition, Madam Chair, we must continue to urge respect 
for the human rights of all individuals in the conflict 
areas; call for free and unhindered humanitarian access to 
the separatist regions; and call for the safe, dignified, and 
voluntary return of internally displaced persons and refugees. 
 
The United States remains committed to helping the parties 
achieve a long-term, peaceful resolution to the conflict, and 
will continue to support Georgia,s sovereignty, 
independence, and territorial integrity within its 
internationally recognized borders. 
 
Thank you, Madam Chair. 
CLINTON
