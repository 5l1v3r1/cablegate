SUBJECT: Tripartite Joint Technical Committee conducts workshop on 
partnership in humanitarian work 
 
¶1.  (U) Summary:  The Tripartite Joint Technical Committee (TJTC) 
facilitated a workshop from October 10 to 12 to encourage 
cooperation between national and international non-governmental 
organizations (INGOs).  Workshop results encouraged increased 
information sharing and openness in NGO partnerships and in the NGO 
operating environment in Sudan more generally.  The workshop 
anticipates the advent in January 2010 of a policy of "Sudanization" 
whereby INGOs will be required to work through local partners.  End 
summary.

¶2.  (U) From October 10 to 12, the TJTC held a workshop entitled 
"Developing a More Effective Partnership between Sudanese and 
International NGOs."  The TJTC includes representatives from the 
Government of National Unity (GNU) Humanitarian Aid Commission 
(HAC), international NGOs and U.N. agencies.  USAID's Office of U.S. 
Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA) staff attended the opening 
session, which focused on brainstorming on ways to enhance future 
cooperation among  participants to provide effective and well- 
targeted humanitarian aid.  A representative of the NGO Steering 
Committee (SC), speaking for the 72 international NGO members, noted 
the workshop's timeliness in light of ongoing efforts to create new 
partnerships between national and international NGOs in Sudan.  The 
SC representative emphasized the important role of Sudanese NGOs in 
humanitarian assistance in Sudan and welcomed additional donor 
participation. 
 
¶3.  (U) During the opening session, the HAC Commissioner and GNU 
representative highlighted the fact that 3,200 national NGOs and 
voluntary agencies currently operate in Sudan, and the HAC would 
like to see national organizations play an increased role in 
humanitarian work and long term development in Sudan.

WORKSHOP RECOMMENDATIONS 
------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (U) USAID/OFDA staff also participated in the closing session, 
which reported on the workshop's progress and conclusions. Workshop 
recommendations included building trust between national and 
international NGOs, establishing contractual agreements between NGO 
partners to encourage transparency and accountability, promoting 
capacity building, simplifying government procedures or visas and 
permits for expatriates to facilitate a cooperative operating 
environment, and establishing a website for information sharing. 
Workshop participants also emphasized that international NGOs should 
be able to choose national NGO partners. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Comment:  USAID/OFDA staff view the workshop as important 
at a sensitive time for humanitarian aid. Following the expulsion of 
13 international NGOs in March 2009, President al Beshir announced a 
policy of "Sudanization" scheduled to take effect in January 2010. 
The new policy will require all international NGOs to work through 
local NGO partners, raising many questions about existing 
partnerships with ministries and churches, as well as the capacity 
of local NGOs to take on large humanitarian operations.  In this 
context, the workshop might be seen as preparation for the roll-out 
of the new policy.  The workshop was well-attended, and the 
facilitator encouraged participants to take control of the workshop 
agenda and recommendations.  The workshop's recommendations will 
likely form the basis for future partnerships between national and 
international NGOs.    End comment.
