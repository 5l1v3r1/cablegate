SUBJECT:

DEMARCHE DELIVERED - UN INERNATIONAL CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION - SUPPORTINGAMCIT NOMINATION REF: A. SECSTATE 109341 B. CAIRO 1139 Classified By: MINISTER-COUNSELOR ONALD A. BLOME REASONS: 1.4 (B) and (D)
1.(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel a in support of Lucretia Myers' candidacy for the UNGA International Civil Service Commission (IGSC) on October 29 to MFA Director of Multilateral Candidatures Mustafa El Kouni. El Kouni took the message and said the GOE would give full consideration to Myers' candidacy, and our request for Egypt to vote for Myers in the November 6 IGSC election.

2.(C) However, Kouni highlighted other multilateral fora in which he claimed the USG had yet to respond to GOE requests for support. These include Egypt's candidacy for re-election as a member of the International Maritime Organization (the election will be held November 23 in London, England); and MFA Assistant Minister for International Organizations Naela Gabr's candidacy to the Committee on Discrimination against Women (election scheduled for June 2010). Kouni said the GOE does not normally engage in trading support of candidates (e.g. GOE support for Myers in return for USG support for an Egyptian candidacy). He strongly implied, however, that positive USG support of these Egyptian candidacies would create a more favorable disposition at the MFA toward U.S. candidacies such as Myers.

3.(C) Comment: In addition to Kouni's complaint, the Egyptians have previously asked for more cooperation on Egyptian and Egyptian-suggested candidates for positions in the UN system, including for non-permanent UN Security Council seats and jobs with the International Court of Justice (reftel b).
