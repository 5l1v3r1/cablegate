¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  On October 6, during the visit of French 
President Nicolas Sarkozy to Astana, the government of Kazakhstan 
signed a memorandum of understanding with a consortium of French 
companies to study construction of a 730-kilometer, on-shore 
pipeline to carry crude oil from Eskene, near Atyrau, to the port of 
Kuryk, south of Aktau.  International oil companies (IOCs) had been 
engaged in negotiations with the government for months prior to the 
announcement, and have expressed concern that the deal will delay 
the $2 billion project.  Senior government officials told Deputy 
Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman that the government will retain 
100% ownership of the pipeline and guarantee tax stability, access 
rights, and market-based tariffs.  Also during Sarkozy's visit, 
Total SA, Europe's third-largest oil company, and GDF Suez SA agreed 
to buy 25% of the offshore Khvalynskoye natural gas field from 
national oil company KazMunaiGas (KMG).  END SUMMARY. 
 
THE ESKENE-KURYK PIPELINE 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On October 6, a consortium of predominantly French 
companies -- including Vinci SA, Entrepose Contracting SA, Spie 
Capag, Mannesmann France, Europipe GmbH, GTS Group, and 
ArcelorMittal -- signed an agreement with the government to study 
construction of an on-shore pipeline that would transport oil from 
Eskene, near the supergiant fields of Kashagan and Tengiz, to the 
Kazakhstani port of Kuryk, for onward shipment via tanker to Baku. 
The pipeline is a key component of the Kazakhstan Caspian 
Transportation System (KCTS) that will deliver Kazakhstani crude oil 
to Baku across the Caspian via tanker.  The contract is expected to 
be worth as much as $2 billion. 
 
KAZAKHSTAN WANTS TO BE A COMMON CARRIER 
 
¶4.  (SBU) On October 7, KMG President Kairgeldy Kabyldin told Deputy 
Secretary of Energy Daniel Poneman that the French consortium 
received financial backing from the export credit agencies (ECA) of 
France and Japan for the construction of the Eskene-Kuryk pipeline. 
He also confirmed that the companies will not acquire equity in the 
pipeline.  "It will be 100% owned by Kazakhstan.  Besides," he 
added, "the international oil companies are not in the pipeline 
business."  Kabyldin said the government's negative experience as a 
partner in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) convinced him that 
this was not the best model to follow for the Eskene-Kuryk pipeline 
project.  In particular, Kabyldin criticized the inefficiencies, 
delays, and cost overruns associated with the construction, 
management, and expansion of the CPC pipeline (ref A). 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Kabyldin said that before signing the agreement with the 
French consortium, KMG offered ExxonMobil and Chevron -- 
representing Kashagan and Tengiz respectively -- guaranteed access, 
preferential tariffs, and tax stability in exchange for a 
ship-or-pay commitment.  Unfortunately, he said, they were not able 
to come to an agreement.  Despite the MOU with the French 
consortium, Kabyldin said that KMG remains ready to continue 
negotiations with the IOCs on the KCTS project.  However, he 
stressed that the government will insist on maintaining complete 
ownership of the transportation infrastructure.  "If we own the 
system," he said, "we can guarantee equal access and fair treatment 
to all.  We can act as a common carrier," and provide a service to 
all shippers, without discrimination or favoritism. 
 
MINISTER OF ENERGY EXPLAINS AGREEMENT WITH FRENCH 
 
¶6.  (SBU) During a private dinner at his residence in Astana on 
October 7, Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Sauat Mynbayev 
told Deputy Secretary of Energy Poneman that Kazakhstan was 
 
ASTANA 00001858  002.3 OF 003 
 
 
originally prepared to offer the IOCs a 49% equity stake in the 
pipeline (ref B).  Mynbayev said that the government would have 
retained a majority stake of 51% and the right to purchase the 
remaining shares at any time.  He also asserted that the government 
asked the IOCs to provide a loan to finance the share purchase, but 
they refused.  When Poneman noted that President Aliyev had told him 
in Baku on October 5 that Azerbaijan would not object to the IOCs 
having equity participation in the KCTS, Mynbaev replied that the 
Government of Azerbaijan had insisted that the Kazakhstan and 
Azerbaijan governments would split their equity shares 50/50, and 
Astana was free to share the GOK's 50% share with the IOCs if it 
wished. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) According to Mynbayev, the government began in July to 
explore alternative financing arrangements to build the pipeline. 
The agreement signed with the French consortium on October 6 allows 
the government to borrow from France's export credit agency (ECA) to 
finance construction of the Eskene-Kuryk pipeline.  If it takes the 
loan, the government will sign an exclusive construction contract 
with the French consortium to build the pipeline, and, according to 
Mynbayev, award France a "pre-emptive right" to negotiate an 
exploration and production contract for an unspecified block. 
However, Mynbayev said that if Kazakhstan is able to borrow from the 
Kashagan partners, or another source, then the government is not 
obligated to use the French companies, or negotiate an exclusive 
exploration and production contract with France.  Mynbayev confirmed 
to Deputy Secretary of Energy Poneman that Kazakhstan will own 100% 
of the pipeline, but provide long-term, stable tariffs and 
guaranteed access. 
 
IOC CONCERNS ABOUT DELAYS 
 
¶8.  (SBU) On October 12, Patty Graham, Director of Government 
Relations for ExxonMobil Kazakhstan, told Energy Officer that the 
agreement with the French consortium may delay construction of KCTS 
and will be an unwelcome distraction for the Kashagan consortium, 
which must make critical decisions by the end of the year on Phase 
II production.  "KMG now has a new opening to discuss third-party 
financing," she said.  "Normally, that takes one or two additional 
years, because investment banks need more reassurance and 
guarantees."  Graham said the French export credit agency will need 
at least six months to assess the risks and returns of the project 
before it commits financing for the pipeline.  As a result, she 
said, KMG will wait at least that long before it responds to an IOC 
offer to build the pipeline in exchange for a minority equity stake. 
 "We don't even know if we're in the ballpark," said Graham.  The 
agreement with the French consortium "creates significant delays," 
she said, "even before we've settled on a business model.  What if 
KMG decides at the end of the road that the terms are too onerous? 
The whole thing could unravel."  Graham added that the French 
agreement was not completely unexpected, since Total has always had 
its eyes set on the transportation component of the Kashagan field. 
 
¶9.  (SBU) Graham said that the consistency of messages from Mynbayev 
and Kabyldin on IOC participation in the Eskene-Kuryk pipeline was a 
clear indication that the decision came from the top (indicating 
specifically, Timur Kulibayev, Deputy Chairman of Samruk-Kazyna). 
She also suggested that the terms that will be offered by the ECAs 
will be more stringent than those that would have been offered by 
the IOCs, and she believes that the Kazakhstanis will ultimately not 
be able to meet the terms of the ECA loan. 
 
SHIPPERS V. OWNERS 
 
¶10.  (SBU) Graham said ExxonMobil and the other Kashagan partners 
are willing to participate in KCTS, even if they do not own equity 
in the project.  "Our concern is not that we might not be given 
ownership in the system," she said, "but rather that after months of 
negotiations, we still have not been able to agree on a business 
model."  Graham said that if the Kashagan partners were to be 
 
ASTANA 00001858  003.3 OF 003 
 
 
shippers only -- not owners -- they would need "a whole slew of 
guarantees on tariff stability and capacity access." 
 
KCTS COULD SHIP OIL TO IRAN 
 
¶11.  (SBU) On October 7, Jay Johnson, Managing Director of Chevron's 
Eurasia Business Unit, told Energy Officer that the French 
consortium will pay 85% of pipeline costs, but will not acquire an 
equity stake in the infrastructure.  He said the government insisted 
on retaining 100% ownership of the pipeline, which it will transfer 
to KMG.  Johnson also expressed concern that without the involvement 
of U.S. companies, the pipeline could be used to send oil to Iran. 
Although Graham agreed that the "Iran option" is an open 
possibility, she noted that the government's primary focus will be 
to build a transportation system to which all shippers will have 
access. 
 
DEAR FRIENDS 
 
¶12.  (U) According to wire reports, during the visit of French 
President Sarkozy on October 6, Total agreed to purchase a 17% 
stake, and GDF Suez an 8% share, of the Khvalynskoye gas field, 
jointly owned by KMG and Russia's Lukoil, which owns 50% of the 
field.  "The gas will be sent to Russia," Total Chief Executive 
Officer Christophe de Margerie said, adding that the French 
companies will contribute about $1 billion of the $3.5 billion to $4 
billion in estimated development costs.  Output may start in 2016 
and reach 8-9 billion cubic meters a year, he said.  Sarkozy and 
President Nursultan Nazarbayev oversaw the signing ceremony and 
referred to each other as "dear friends" at a business forum held 
after the talks.  Sarkozy praised Kazakhstan's role in securing 
stability in the volatile region and said Astana could help resolve 
the Afghan crisis.  When asked about criticism Kazakhstan has faced 
over its human rights record ahead of chairing the Organization for 
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), Sarkozy said he was 
convinced Astana was moving towards OSCE standards.  "We have made 
our political choice, my dear friend, and I hope you will see that 
when France makes a political choice it sticks to it to the end," he 
told Nazarbayev. 
 
¶13. (SBU) COMMENT:  The agreement with the French consortium is not 
a done deal.  In fact, it is not a deal at all.  It is simply a 
memorandum of understanding that allows the government, in theory, 
to borrow money from an ECA at favorable rates in exchange for 
hiring French companies to build the pipeline.  As both KMG 
President Kabyldin and Minister of Energy Mynbayev made clear to 
Deputy Secretary of Energy Poneman, the government is eager to 
resume negotiations with the IOCs whose volume commitments are 
essential if KCTS is to become operational.  Third-party financing 
from France's export credit agency may delay the government's 
negotiations with the IOCs, which in turn could adversely affect the 
pace of negotiations on CPC expansion.  The government's 
determination to own what it considers strategic infrastructure is 
understandable, and its commitment to provide stable, predictable 
access to KCTS should be taken seriously.  Despite a number of 
high-profile disputes -- most recently, BG Group's request for 
reimbursement of $1 billion in crude export duties -- the government 
has generally honored its commitments and kept its promises, 
particularly when the stakes are this high.  END COMMENT. 
 
¶14.  (U) Deputy Secretary Poneman has cleared this cable.
