Â¶1. We delivered reftel demarche to Dorin Panfil, Head of NATO and 
Politico-Military Cooperation Division, Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
and European Integration (MFA), on September 28, 2009.  Panfil 
responded that the Government of Moldova would support the U.S. 
without question on this issue as they understood the gravity of 
recent developments in Iran.  He further stated that he would write 
a comprehensive note and deliver it to the new Foreign Minister, 
Iurie Leanca.  Post will report any further substantive response 
from the MFA.
