¶1. Between October 12 and October 18 Portugal diagnosed 3,044 new 
cases with flu symptoms. Fifteen patients remain hospitalized, 
including two in intensive care.  Portugal has had four confirmed 
H1N1 fatalities to date. 
 
¶2. The third fatality was a 53-year-old male who died from bilateral 
pneumonia and had no previous illness.  The fourth fatality was a 
32-year-old female that had recently given birth through a c-section 
to save the newborn's life. She died with viral pneumonia, 
respiratory failure and required assisted ventilation. 
 
¶3. Health officials issued further information regarding the H1N1 
vaccination plan. The goal is to vaccinate more than 3 million 
people, representing approximately 30 percent of the population. 
Groups will be vaccinated in stages, with highest priority given to 
those deemed most vulnerable due to increased risk of developing 
complications or a higher likelihood of acquiring infection.  Health 
care workers and essential workers in key industries will also be 
given high priority.  High-priority persons are required to submit a 
doctor's written verification of their priority status. 
 
¶4. The first vaccines were administered on October 26. Health 
Minister Jorge said it will take about a month for the initial 
54,000 doses to be administered.
