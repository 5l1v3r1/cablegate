¶1. (U) SUMMARY: As existing Iraqi banks mature, open new branches 
nationwide, and focus on their wealthiest customers, accessible 
community banks may provide a viable option for low- to 
middle-income villagers.  The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) is 
considering a proposal to create second-tier "community" banks, 
which would have lower capital requirements and be limited to only 
one office per town.  These community banks would formalize some of 
the financial intermediation going through traditional "hawala" 
schemes and could provide Iraq's first private-sector microfinance 
loans.  END SUMMARY. 
 
PRIVATE BANKS MATURING ACROSS IRAQ 
 
¶2. (U) While Iraq's public banks are still restructuring, some 
private banks are maturing relatively quickly (reftel).  Since June 
2008, private bank lending has increased by 83 percent to over one 
billion USD.  Nine private banks have adopted electronic funds 
transfer technology across 161 branches nationwide.  Visa and 
Mastercard credit and debit cards are available to their most 
sophisticated customers and more than 300 credit card readers have 
been installed in shops.  The best Iraqi private banks want to be 
regional players in the Middle East and beyond.  However, they are 
not paying much attention to many of the potential customers in 
their own backyard. 
 
CBI RAISING CAPITAL REQUIREMENT TO WEED OUT NON-PERFORMERS 
 
¶3. (U) Currently, the CBI requires a nationwide private bank to have 
statutory capital of 50 billion IQD ($42.7 million).  Most private 
banks have met that requirement and those that have not are either 
looking to merge with another bank or applying for a specific 
extension.  Within the next twelve months, the CBI intends to raise 
the statutory requirement to 250 billion IQD ($213.6 million) to 
weed out non-performers and ensure that banks keep capital 
proportional to the size of their growing businesses. 
 
COMMUNITY LEVEL FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION NEEDED 
 
¶4. (U) As successful private banks look to expand with wealthy local 
customers, there is a growing niche for financial intermediation for 
working and middle class Iraqis.  Nationwide private banks are 
reportedly not making small loans as it is not cost efficient to 
manage them.  In response, the CBI Board of Directors formed a Board 
sub-committee to explore creating a second tier of "community" 
banks.  Such banks would require less statutory capital and be 
limited in operations.  Some possible parameters for community banks 
include: 
 
- Geographic limit to one office in one city or village outside of 
Baghdad. 
- Loans restricted to private individuals or private companies 
within that community. 
- Deposits limited to less than 10,000 USD. 
- Partner with a first-tier bank that will perform international 
transactions on behalf of their customers. 
 
BENEFITS OF COMMUNITY BANKING 
 
¶5. (U) These private-sector second-tier banks could provide 
increased opportunities for access to credit given the limited 
outreach to date of donor-funded microfinance organizations.  The 
banks could also formalize some of the financial intermediation 
going through traditional Middle Eastern "hawala" schemes, in which 
money is transferred through money brokers without a paper trail. 
Representatives of PRTs throughout Iraq have indicated that Iraqis 
would be more receptive to opening accounts at banks that invest in 
their communities rather than putting their deposits in a branch of 
a Baghdad-based bank. 
COMMENT 
 
¶6. (SBU) Community banking has the potential to further Iraq's 
development, especially in outlying communities.  Community banks' 
Qdevelopment, especially in outlying communities.  Community banks' 
capacity to develop wealth at the lower socio-economic levels by 
promoting entrepreneurship in a sustainable fashion has proven 
effective in many other emerging market economies.  Donor assistance 
to CBI to develop the legal and regulatory framework, combined with 
on-the-ground PRT assistance in the near term, may be a way to 
leverage untapped private sector financial resources.
