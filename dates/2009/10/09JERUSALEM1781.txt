Main Stories: 
------------- 
For the third consecutive day, the dailies report on the 
confrontations between the Israeli police and Palestinians in the 
old city of Jerusalem and Al-Aqsa mosque. The papers quote 
Palestinian Liberation Organization Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat 
accusing Israel of intentionally creating a very dangerous situation 
in East Jerusalem to provoke violence so that they can justify the 
strict measures they will impose accordingly. Senior Fatah official 
Mohammad Dahlan noted that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu 
has opened the battle of "sovereignty over Jerusalem." Israeli Vice 
Prime Minister Silvan Shalom confirmed Dahlan's sentiments, saying 
that Israel is asserting its sovereignty over Jerusalem, especially 
the Temple Mount area. The dailies also report that the Israeli 
Police arrested the head of Islamic movement in Israel Sheikh Raed 
Salah yesterday, accusing him of incitement against Israel and 
encouraging violence in Jerusalem. 
 
The dailies report on Special Envoy George Mitchell's visit to 
Israel today. The coverage notes that Mitchell will conduct meetings 
with Israeli Minister of Defense Ehud Barak and Prime Minister 
Netanyahu on Friday. The coverage notes that Mitchell and Secretary 
Hilary Clinton are expected to submit a report on the progress made 
towards a resumption of negotiations between Palestinians and 
Israelis to President Obama. 
 
The local press highlights Palestinian Authority (PA) President 
Mahmoud Abbas welcoming Libya's call for an urgent session of the UN 
Security Council to discuss the Goldstone report. Abbas noted in a 
phone interview with AFP from Rome that the PA appreciates Libya's 
efforts and support. Abbas noted that he will send PA Minister of 
Foreign Affairs Riyad Malki to New York to attend this session. 
 
The local press reports on Egyptian efforts to ensure that the 
national reconciliation agreement is signed in Cairo on October 22. 
Reporting notes that despite the decision to postpone the vote on 
the Goldstone report, Hamas is committed to achieving national 
reconciliation.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
 
1) Hamada Fara'neh opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the 
title "No hope in America" (10/07): "There is no hope that America 
will take a stronger position supporting the Palestinians for two 
reasons. The first is the powerful role of the Israeli Jewish 
Zionist movement in the US that doesn't allow the US to support the 
Palestinians. The second is that the US is busy with many internal 
and external problems that distract Obama's administration from 
focusing on ending the suffering of the Palestinian people." 
 
2) Ibrahim Abrash opines in Al-Quds independent daily under the 
title "the danger behind postponing the discussion of the Goldstone 
report" (10/07):"Postponing the vote of the Goldstone report was a 
big mistake. But it is also not useful to keep investigating whether 
the postponement was based on US pressure exerted on the 
Palestinians, because it was ... We could have certainly understood 
the move if there was any value behind the postponement, but we 
don't see any."
