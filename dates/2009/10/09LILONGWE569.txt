¶1. (SBU)  DCM delivered (reftel A) briefing to GOM Ministry 
of Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Anthony Livuza Oct. 
¶20.   Livuza acknowledged that the Iranian government had an 
obligation to provide full access to IAEA inspectors to the 
new enrichment facility.  He added that it was incumbent on 
the Iranians to negotiate in good faith on the proposal 
concerning fuel assemblies for the TRR, particularly given 
the Obama Administration's new approach toward Iran. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Concerning Malawi's own ties with Iran, Livuza 
remarked that the agreements signed in 2007 (reftel B) during 
a visit by the Iranian Foreign Minister had resulted in 
little of consequence.  "We have nothing going on with Iran," 
he concluded.
