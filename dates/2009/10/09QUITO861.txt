SUBJECT: CORREA DECLARES "STATE OF EXCEPTION" IN THREE CITIES TO 
COMBAT CRIME 
 
¶1.  (SBU) On September 30, 2009, President Rafael Correa signed 
Presidential Decree #82, putting into effect a state of exception 
for the cities of Quito, Guayaquil, and Manta.  The state of 
exception allows for the Ecuadorian Armed Forces to collaborate and 
support the Ecuadorian National Police in operations to combat 
crime and in operations to control arms and vehicles within the 
cities of Quito, Guayaquil, and Manta.  The decree will be in 
effect for 60 days and does not suspend any citizens' rights. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The decree is in response to the high number of criminal 
incidents that have occurred in the aforementioned cities and 
provides additional manpower and support to the Ecuadorian National 
Police.  The decree also names the Minister of Government and 
Police as responsible for the coordination of the action between 
the Armed Forces and Police. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Comment: It is not believed that the state of exception 
is a response to the recent nationwide protests carried out by 
indigenous groups which has seen some violent confrontations 
between the Ecuadorian National Police and protesters.  Recent 
comments by Minister of Government and Police Jalkh indicate the 
state of exception is specifically in response to the increased 
numbers of homicides and express kidnappings recently seen in 
Quito, Guayaquil, and Manta.  It is anticipated that these cities 
will see a substantial increase in police checkpoints, with the 
security forces establishing a stronger presence throughout.  This 
increased presence may have a temporary deterrent effect in regards 
to the high levels of crime, but it is unlikely that this 
collaboration between the Ecuadorian Armed Forces and the 
Ecuadorian National Police will tackle the numerous factors which 
create a soaring level of insecurity throughout Ecuador.  End 
Comment.
