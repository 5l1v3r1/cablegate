CASE NO. K-0812 
 
REF: SECSTATE 99479 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Per reftel request, AIT Econ Officer and FN visited Golden 
Orient Ltd. in Kaohsiung City and interviewed the company's 
President, Mr. James Yu, and Sales Manager, Ms. Silvia Sun, at the 
company's new office located at 589, Zhengde Road, Tsoying District, 
Kaohsiung City. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Ms. Sun told AIT personnel that the company was relocated 
to the new location on March 28, 2009 as part of the business's 
expansion plans.  Sun said that Golden Orient received approval from 
the Kaohsiung City Government on 5 May 1997 to conduct trading on 
commodities, including electronics-related products, diving 
equipment, aviation and navigation instruments, and computer 
software.  The company currently has twelve employees.  President Yu 
can be reached at the office telephone number 886-7-343-4196.  The 
fax number is 886-7-343-0113.  His e-mail address is 
golden98@ms17.hinet.net. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) President Yu told us that Taiwan's military institutes and 
the Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology (CSIST) of 
Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense are his target customers, whom 
he has been serving for over a decade.  Yu stated that he did not do 
business outside of Taiwan, nor did he operate offices overseas. 
Both Yu and Sun said that they were very familiar with U.S. 
restrictions on the procurement of U.S. Munitions List commodities. 
Yu mentioned that he recently failed to procure from the US a small 
quantity of connectors for a local end user, Taiwan's Naval Combat 
System Shipyard, because his U.S. suppliers were unable to obtain an 
export license for this commodity. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Golden Orient's office consists of a three-story building 
located within the Kaohsiung Indigenous Plant Garden.  President Yu 
and the staff work in the offices located on the second and the 
third floors.  The first floor is a garage-style storeroom with 
access from the front, street side of the building as well as a 
smaller entry way in the back of the building.  This storeroom is 
accessible by all the company employees.  In addition, there is a 
storage room on the second floor where the company stores smaller 
commodities.  This room is kept locked and only accessible by Mr. Yu 
and Ms. Sun.  The office appears to be secure, with Taiwan Chung 
Hsing Security Co., Ltd providing round-the-clock monitoring 
services.  Both Yu and Sun appeared well versed in their business 
and the needs of their customer base.  They were cooperative and 
willing to answer AIT's questions and provided written documentation 
to support their statements. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Post has no derogatory information in its files concerning 
Golden Orient, Ltd. or its owner.  Post learned through our Taiwan 
law-enforcement sources, however, that Mr. Yu was charged with a 
violation of the regulation "Governing Guns and Knives" in 2002 but 
was not indicted. 
 
¶6.  Comment:  Accusations of fraud, forgery, and other 
business-related crimes are very common in Taiwan, and because this 
broker was not indicted of any crime, Post believes this information 
does not call info question the bona fides of the broker.  End 
Comment.
