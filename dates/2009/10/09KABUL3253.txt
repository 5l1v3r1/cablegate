Termination"; 09KABUL1840 and reftels 
 
¶1. The Interagency Provincial Affairs (IPA) Office of Mission 
Afghanistan has begun to rely on the Intelink portal and the 
associated "UGov" enterprise email as a primary mechanism for 
communication with our Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT) and 
other field representatives from the Department of State, USAID and 
USDA.  At present, almost 135 field officers have active Intelink 
passports, and we are working aggressively to migrate all users away 
from commercial email (such as Gmail and Yahoo) to SBU-capable UGov. 
 With the steady increase in field positions, we anticipate that 
over 400 U.S. Mission users will use Intelink and related enterprise 
services, including UGov, by March 2010. 
 
¶2. Since 2002, field representatives, especially those in 
coalition-led PRTs, have been forced to rely on commercial email 
accounts to communicate with Embassy Kabul because it was the only 
low-band-width, internet-based platform available to them.  While 
convenient and inexpensive, these commercial accounts are not 
appropriate for handling sensitive information that field 
representatives must send and receive on a daily basis.  The 
enterprise solution offered by Intelink and UGov resolves a plethora 
of communication issues, providing a low-bandwidth platform that is 
SBU-capable.  We are using it not only for basic email, but also for 
shared documents, briefcases (where groups of related documents can 
be organized and stored) and calendars.  This is particularly useful 
in Afghanistan, where phone lines are unreliable and where field 
reps rely heavily on slow satellite communication for internet 
connection.  Embassy Kabul is working to bring OpenNet and better 
technology to all civilian desktops in Afghanistan, but it could be 
up to a year before the technology is fully functioning in all 
locations.  We understand and appreciate that the State CIO has 
approached the ODNI on the importance of continuing the UGOV 
capability for both existing and new users at least thru FY10.  We 
hope that Intelink and UGov will continue to be available as a key 
component of our knowledge management needs in Afghanistan and as a 
valuable source of support for USG personnel working under extremely 
adverse conditions to advance America's highest priority foreign 
policy objectives.
