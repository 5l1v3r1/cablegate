SUBJECT: 243RD MEETING OF THE UN COMMITTEE ON RELATIONS 
WITH THE HOST COUNTRY 
 
 ¶1.  The UN Committee on Relations with the Host Country held 
its 243rd meeting on October 2, 2009.  Cypriot PermRep 
Hadjimichael chaired the meeting in which the following 
issues were raised: 
 
NYC PARKING VIOLATIONS 
 
¶2.  The Cuban delegate reported that a mission driver was 
unable to park in one of its Mission's dedicated spaces 
because an NYPD vehicle was occupying the space.  The Cuban 
vehicle then received a parking ticket.  USUN/HC MinCouns 
acknowledged that USUN had received the Cuban complaint in 
writing and noted that the mission had contested the parking 
ticket.  He suggested that the mission wait to see if the 
violation is dismissed. 
 
¶3.  The Mali delegate expressed his frustration with the 
parking program, and complained that Malian vehicles were 
being ticketed while parked in their assigned parking spaces. 
 He said that the mission was able to fit three vehicles in 
its two assigned spaces and that he could not understand why 
these vehicles, which had diplomatic plates identifying them 
with the mission, were constantly issued parking tickets. 
USUN/HC MinCouns pointed out that according to the Parking 
Program, vehicles must have the required decals to park 
legally in those designated spaces.  He noted that incoming 
diplomats may not always take the time to read the parking 
program, but rules governing the NYC Diplomatic Parking 
Program had been carefully worked out, and that the UN Legal 
Counsel had reviewed the program and determined that it was 
in accordance with host country obligations.  He offered to 
discuss the matter further with the Mali delegate after the 
meeting to clarify aspects of what is a very comprehensive 
program. 
 
TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS 
 
¶4.  Russian Federation congratulated USDel for the enormous 
amount of support the host country had given all delegations 
during the visit of numerous Heads of State/Government for 
the 64th UN General Debate.   He then raised the issue of 
travel restrictions affecting diplomats at the Russian 
mission and at the UN Secretariat, and the requirement that 
they notify the US of travel beyond 25 miles of Columbus 
Circle.  He noted that despite the issue having been raised 
in previous meetings, there had been no progress in 
addressing the problem, and indicated that his Mission would 
likely want to discuss this matter in the near future. 
 
¶5.  The Chair announced the next meeting of the Committee 
would take place on November 2, 2009 to adopt the Committee's 
annual report.
