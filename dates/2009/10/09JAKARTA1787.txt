Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  On September 30, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck off the coast 
of Sumatra Island.  In response, Post issued a disaster declaration, 
and a USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) deployed 
to Padang, West Sumatra Province.  To date, the USAID/DART has 
programmed nearly $5.3 million in funding from USAID's Office of 
U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA), with plans to program 
additional funding for disaster response and disaster risk reduction 
activities.  USAID/OFDA support includes an airlift of emergency 
relief commodities and programs to provide affected populations with 
relief commodities and urgent shelter, health, protection, 
humanitarian coordination and information management, and water, 
sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) assistance.  The U.S. Department of 
Defense (DoD) also provided support, including a mobile medical unit 
and transportation, worth nearly $3.8 million.  On October 25, the 
USAID/DART departed Padang.  Two USAID/OFDA field officers plan to 
remain in Padang through mid-November to finish programming 
remaining funding and ensure that programs meet beneficiaries' 
needs.  End summary.

Earthquake in West Sumatra Province 
----------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  On September 30, a magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck approximately 
30 miles off the western coast of Sumatra Island, causing 
significant damage in West Sumatra Province.  The earthquake killed 
1,117 people, according to the Government of Indonesia (GoI), and 
affected at least 1.2 million others, according to the U.N. World 
Health Organization (WHO).  The quake damaged or destroyed 
approximately 265,000 houses, led to landslides that blocked or 
damaged roads, and caused numerous schools, hospitals, government 
offices, and other public buildings to collapse or sustain 
significant damage.  The most affected areas include Agam, Padang, 
and Padang Pariaman districts. 
 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
Disaster Declaration and Deployment of USAID/DART 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶3.  On October 1, the GoI declared a state of emergency, and 
Ambassador Cameron R. Hume issued a disaster declaration.  In 
response, USAID/OFDA provided an initial $300,000 for shelter and 
WASH assistance. 
 
¶4.  On October 2, a USAID/DART deployed to Indonesia, and team 
members began to arrive in country on October 4.  The 12-member team 
included a team leader, program officer, field officer, shelter and 
settlements specialist, safety and security officer, communications 
officer, logistics officer, press officer, administrative officer, 
information officer, and two military liaison officers.

USAID/DART Activities and Programming 
------------------------------------- 
 
-- USAID/DART Activities -- 
 
¶5.  The USAID/DART conducted assessments of humanitarian needs and 
coordinated assistance with the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta, 
USAID/Indonesia, DoD, the GoI, members of the humanitarian 
community, and implementing partners.  Aerial and ground assessments 
indicated that the primary humanitarian need of earthquake-affected 
populations is emergency shelter assistance and that populations 
also require varying degrees of assistance to meet WASH, health, 
food, early recovery, protection, and other needs.

-- Current Programming -- 
 
¶6.  In response to humanitarian needs, the USAID/DART has programmed 
nearly $5.3 million.  Implementing partners include the American Red 
Cross, the Indonesian Red Cross (PMI), Mercy Corps, International 
Medical Corps (IMC), and the U.N. Office for the Coordination of 
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA).  Per reftel, the USAID/DART has 
monitored partners' activities. 
 
¶7.  Shortly after the earthquake, USAID/OFDA provided $300,000 to 
Mercy Corps for shelter and WASH assistance.  USAID/OFDA also 
provided $3 million through Mercy Corps to humanitarian 
organizations in the Emergency Capacity Building (ECB) consortium 
that are responding to the earthquake.  Of the grant to ECB, Save 
the Children received $1.1 million, Catholic Relief Services 
received $400,000, World Vision was awarded more than $500,000, CARE 
received $400,000, and Build Change was awarded $100,000.  These 
organizations are distributing emergency relief commodities and 
providing temporary shelter and WASH assistance in Pariaman 
District; Agam District, including Tanjung Raya Sub-district; and 
Sungai Limau Sub-district of Padang Pariaman District. 
 
¶8.  USAID/OFDA has provided nearly $500,000 to the American Red 
Cross and commodities valued at nearly $400,000, including 
transport, to PMI.  The American Red Cross is working in Indonesia 
through PMI, which is providing relief commodities to affected 
populations.  The American Red Cross is procuring pumps and small 
generators to attach to the Padang city water system in order to 
develop public hydrants.  The public hydrants will replace the 
current tankering system that is supplying water for Padang, as up 
to 80 percent of city residents are without running water due to the 
earthquake, according to OCHA.  In addition, the American Red Cross 
is procuring 5,000 family kits, 1,000 baby kits, and 10,000 sarongs 
for distribution to affected households. 
 
¶9.  USAID/OFDA has provided $500,000 to IMC for a program targeting 
Padang Pariaman District.  With USAID/OFDA funding, IMC is 
addressing the critical emergency health care and psychosocial needs 
of earthquake-affected populations.  USAID/OFDA funding also allowed 
IMC to support search and recovery efforts through local partner 
Ambulan 118.  IMC is coordinating all health activities with the 
Padang Pariaman District Health Department and the Provincial 
Coordinating Unit for the Management of Disaster and conducting 
activities through the Indonesian health care system. 
 
¶10.  USAID/OFDA has provided $400,000 to OCHA to support 
humanitarian coordination and information management.  OCHA has 
coordinated the cluster system, which the U.N. stood up in West 
Sumatra following the earthquake.  OCHA has been responsible for 
facilitating engagement between the GoI National Disaster Management 
Agency (BNPB) and members of the humanitarian community.  OCHA is 
also responsible for facilitating coordination within each cluster, 
which has been strong. 
 
-- Planned Programming -- 
 
¶11.  Due to significant humanitarian needs for transitional shelter, 
USAID/OFDA plans to program additional funding for two 
non-governmental organizations to implement transitional shelter 
activities.  In addition, USAID/OFDA tentatively plans to provide 
funding for disaster risk reduction activities, including a 
training-of-trainers program in earthquake resistant structures, as 
well as an earthquake preparedness curriculum for primary schools. 
 
-- Shelter Activities -- 
 
¶12.  The USAID/DART has issued regular reports on team activities 
and humanitarian conditions of earthquake-affected populations.  The 
primary humanitarian need of the affected population is shelter, and 
both humanitarian programs and spontaneous recovery by households 
are beginning to address needs.  However, the shelters currently 
being built are inadequate to serve as transitional shelter for up 
 
JAKARTA 00001787  003 OF 003 
 
 
to two years, generally the length of time necessary for the GoI, 
affected households, and others to rebuild permanent shelters.  The 
core challenges of the humanitarian community in Indonesia are thus 
related to the provision of transitional shelter, which is 
increasingly viewed as the first phase of the longer-term 
reconstruction effort. 
 
-------------- 
DoD Assistance 
-------------- 
 
¶13.  On October 2, Post requested DoD's assistance.  In response, 
DoD sent three ships, one cargo plane, and five helicopters to 
Padang.  DoD fixed and rotary wing aircraft transported 997 
passengers and 401,000 pounds of cargo.  In addition, DoD deployed a 
Humanitarian Assistance Rapid Response Team (HARRT), or mobile 
medical unit, to Padang.  The HARRT treated 1,945 patients in eight 
days.  DoD assistance is valued at nearly $3.8 million. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
Continuing to Assess and Meet Humanitarian Needs 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶14.  On October 25, the USAID/DART departed Padang.  However, two 
USAID/OFDA field officers remain in Padang through mid-November to 
continue to assess humanitarian conditions, finish programming 
additional funding, and work with implementing partners to ensure 
that programs meet beneficiaries' needs.
