SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (10/28): More Palestinian homes 
demolished in East Jerusalem 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The dailies highlight news on the Jerusalem municipality demolishing 
8 Palestinian houses yesterday in East Jerusalem due to the lack of 
appropriate building permits, leaving 80 people homeless. Al-Quds 
reports that the demolition was carried out under the full 
protection of the Israeli police. Two Israeli soldiers were injured 
in confrontations with citizens during the demolition. Al-Quds runs 
a front-page photo of a blind man sitting on the debris of his 
demolished room holding the demolition order he received from the 
authorities. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Ayyam run front page stories stating that 
Secretary Hillary Clinton will visit Israel and the Palestinian 
Territories on Saturday. The reports note that Clinton will hold 
meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and 
Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to discuss the 
resumption of negotiations. The coverage also notes that Special 
Envoy George Mitchell will visit the region on Thursday to prepare 
for Secretary Clinton's visit. 
 
Maan news agency reports on a statement by Fatah leader Abdullah Abu 
Samhadaneh saying that President Abbas will not run for President in 
the January elections unless he is asked to do so by Fatah's 
leaders.  Abu Samhadaneh said that Abbas is "eager to rest from this 
long and arduous trip," but also noted that if Abbas "is instructed 
by the command [from Palestinian leaders], he will accept the 
commission." In related news, Al-Ayyam runs a front page story on 
Hamas leader Yahia Mousa announcing that Hamas will not allow the 
Central Committee of Elections in Gaza to prepare for the 
presidential and legislative elections. 
 
Al-Ayyam's lead story highlights news on Israeli settlers attacking 
Palestinian citizens in Qaryout village in the northern West Bank 
during their annual olive harvest under the protection of Israeli 
soldiers. The reports note that 7 Palestinians were injured during 
the attack. 
 
Hamas newspaper Al-Resalah quotes the spokesperson of Al-Qassam 
brigades in Gaza Abu Obaida noting that the brigades will continue 
to kidnap Israeli soldiers to exchange them for Palestinian 
prisoners 
 
Gaza-based Al-Quds radio reports on Fatah leader Abu Samhadana 
noting in a press conference that if Hamas continues to refuse to 
cooperate with the elections committee, the committee will find a 
way to allow Gazans to participate in the elections without Hamas's 
approval. 
------------- 
BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title: "Why 
This Determination to Provoke the Feelings of Muslims at Al-Aqsa 
Mosque?"(10/28): "Why does the Israeli government give the green 
light to settlers to start unnecessary confrontations between Jews 
and Muslims at this time in particular? Is it to distract people's 
attention away from Israel's rejection of US and international 
demands to halt settlement activity and revive the peace process?" 
 
2) Omar Hilmi Al-Ghoul opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily 
under the title "Who is the Next Presidential Candidate?" (10/28): 
 
JERUSALEM 00001953  002 OF 002 
 
 
"The only way to fill the constitutional vacuum which is likely to 
occur is to re-elect President Abbas for another term. Abbas is very 
popular, as demonstrated in all the opinion polls ... Abbas is the 
best and most appropriate candidate for president. He is the only 
one who can build on previous efforts and achieve progress."
