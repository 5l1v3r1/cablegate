REF: A. STATE 110306 
     ¶B. 06 SAN JOSE 1569 
 
¶1. Per Ref A, Post establishes the bona fides of the 
transaction by Koruma Lenex to purchase 349 Beretta Model 
92FS pistols for the Costa Rican Ministry of Public Security 
(MPS).  Post's contacts within the MPS confirmed to us that 
they ordered these weapons as part of the GOCR's new 
anti-crime strategy that is related to and complementary of 
the USG's Merida Initiative. 
 
¶2. Post has no current derogatory information on Koruma Lenex 
as reported per Ref B.  Since 2006, Post has interviewed and 
checked the facilities of Koruma Lenex on several occasions 
and found them to be legitimate recipients of United States 
Munition List items.  MPS also confirmed to us that Lenex has 
not been selling weapons to Armeria Rex, a gunshop that has 
been suspected of diverting firearms to entities outside of 
Costa Rica in the past.
