Classified By: Ambassador Daniel M. Rooney.  Reasons 1.4(b/d). 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY: A long-time insider in the governing party 
Fianna Fail (FF), believes negotiations on a new Program for 
Government with FF's coalition partner, the Greens, will be 
successful.  She cautions, though, that the Greens are 
unpredictable.  Also, Prime Minister Brian Cowen is 
consulting colleagues about his difficult decision on the 
next Irish nominee for the EU Commission.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (C) On October 8, Ambassador Rooney met with Mary Hanafin 
(PROTECT), Irish Minister for Social and Family Affairs. 
Hanafin, of the Fianna Fail (FF) party, is participating in 
negotiations on a new Program for Government with FF,s 
junior coalition partner, the Greens.  Green Party members 
will vote on the Program at a party convention this Saturday, 
October 10, and must approve the Program by a two-thirds 
majority (ref A).  Hanafin said the negotiations were 
cordial, but then added that theatrics demanded that there be 
plenty of pounding the table and other indications of 
indignation on the part of the Greens' negotiators.  On the 
night of October 7, a negotiator (whom Hanafin did not name) 
had gathered up his things and left the meeting in a huff, 
only to return the next morning calmed down and ready to 
continue talking. 
 
¶3. (C) Hanafin said she was confident the Greens would 
approve the Program for Government, but added that it was 
difficult to tell what would happen when dealing with a party 
in which each member,s single issue often seems to override 
a comprehensive party program.  She said she had the 
impression that, if some of the Greens had their way, the 
Program for Government would emphasize "hares, stags and 
badgers while everyone else in the country is drowning in 
this economy."  (NOTE: some Greens members are strongly 
opposed to traditional Irish hunting. END NOTE.) 
 
¶4. (C) Hanafin said Prime Minister Cowen had recently been 
talking to her about the next Irish nominee for EU 
Commissioner.  Echoing other interlocutors (ref C), she said 
it would be a difficult choice since taking someone from FF 
would probably mean losing a seat in Parliament thereby 
weakening an already slim majority, but naming someone from 
the opposition would be going against PM Cowen,s grain. 
Hanafin said there was a window of only about two weeks to 
inform EU Commission President Barroso of the Irish nominee, 
in order to have a chance at getting a substantive Commission 
portfolio "such as agriculture."  Hanafin added that the task 
of nominating an EU Commissioner had just gotten harder after 
the previous day's sudden resignation of the Speaker of 
Parliament (ref B) -- now the Prime Minister would have to 
find two qualified candidates for these "plum jobs."
