(U) On October 12 MFA spokesman Hassan Qashqavi held his weekly 
press conference.  The following are approximate translations of 
his comments on the nuclear issue, taken from October 12 ISNA 
coverage. 
 
 
 
- Nothing relating to Iran's nuclear rights was discussed in the 
Geneva discussions; we have stood firm on this subject and moved 
forward. 
 
 
 
- We had made an announcement about the Fordo (i.e. Qom) 
Installation before the Geneva discussions and the mechanism for 
discussions is between us and the IAEA and this matter relates 
solely to these two entities, not to the 5+1 Group.. The Fordo 
Installation has no relation to the Geneva discussions. 
 
 
 
- The matter of the 20 percent enrichment isn't connected to the 
Geneva discussions either and the President had announced it in 
his trip to New York.  We had said that our fuel would run out 
after a period. 
 
 
 
- [concerning Iran's desire to import 20 percent enriched 
uranium]: This doesn't mean that we are fixated on importing it; 
we can't stop the work of 150 hospitals and provide it [the 
fuel] should it be necessary.  We are not joking with anyone 
about meeting this need. 
 
 
 
- We want to get 20 percent enriched uranium and ensha'allah it 
will be agreed that this fuel is imported into Iran.. due to the 
tremendous respect we have for international laws we announced 
our desire for 20 percent enriched fuel and it has been agreed 
that a tripartite meeting be held among Iran, the IAEA and 
countries who have expressed a willingness in order to discuss 
price, the method of delivery and the shape of work. 
 
 
 
- [question: weren't the Geneva meetings influenced by the 
subject of the 20 percent enrichment and the Fordo 
Installation?]: When Iran's nuclear issue was put forward the 
subject was totally transparent and clear.. [ explaining that 
Iran has said repeatedly that its nuclear rights are 
non-negotiable, he continued]:  this means continuation of 
activities within the framework of the NPT, IAEA regulations and 
Safeguard articles. 
 
 
 
- I don't know why some domestically and abroad have insisted to 
this extent that the issue of the Fordo Installation and of 20 
percent enrichment are connected to the Geneva discussions.. no 
matter how much I look I can't see a connection between these 
two subjects and [Iran's] nuclear rights. 
 
 
 
- The negotiating sides in Geneva comprising Iran's 
representative and representatives of the 5+1 Countries all 
expressed their satisfaction concerning these discussions and 
accepted that the basis of negotiations in the second round of 
discussions would be Iran's proposed package. 
 
 
 
[question: Secretary Clinton has said that the US cannot wait 
forever for Iran's answer] Our commitment to international laws 
is in essence a legal one and statements about deadlines and 
timing have no influence on us.  We are active NPT members and 
carry out our work legally. 
 
 
 
 
DUBAI 00000430  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
- [on sanctions]: We've said it repeatedly and they themselves 
know that the language of threats and sanctions is useless .. 
concerning dialogue and negotiations we have always announced 
that we favor discussion and "Geneva 2" has also proven this. 
 
 
 
- Iran fully has a presence and influence in global management 
[i.e. affairs] and our influence will grow in the future.. Iran 
is a global strategic power.
