¶1.  (SBU) PolOff delivered subject demarche to Abdelmounaim 
El Farouq, Chief of the MFA's Division on Humanitarian and 
Social Questions, Oct. 26.  El Farouq said the GOM would 
support the country-specific resolutions concerning Burma and 
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  El Farouq also 
said the GOM would support our traditional biennial 
resolution on free elections. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Regarding the Organization of the Islamic 
Conference's (OIC) resolution on the defamation of religions, 
El Farouq could not give us a clear answer as to how the GOM 
will vote.  He pointed out that Morocco co-authored the 
recent U.S.-Egypt Freedom of Expression resolution in the 
Human Rights Council, and he stated that Morocco would try to 
find a way not to contradict its position as expressed in 
that resolution. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On Iran, El Farouq said frankly that Morocco is in a 
difficult position.  Due to the recent severing of diplomatic 
relations between Morocco and Iran, the GOM would tend to 
support Canada's annual resolution.  However, Morocco's 
regional partners would expect the GOM to support their 
consensus position.  In light of this apparent contradiction, 
El Farouq suggested that the GoM might be forced to make use 
of the no-action motion to show some support for their fellow 
OIC countries; this position could change if the issue comes 
to a second vote.
