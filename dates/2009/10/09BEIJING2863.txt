  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  U.S. POLICY 
 
"Looking into the hidden truth about Obama's first Asia trip" 
 
Elite Reference (Qingnian Cankao), a newspaper affiliated with the 
official Communist Youth League China Youth Daily (10/13)(pg 14): 
"On Obama's first trip to Asia, his attendance at the U.S.-ASEAN 
summit in Singapore is meant to show the U.S.'s return to East Asia 
in all aspects and it indicates the fact that East Asia plays 
important role in Obama's new diplomacy.  He will stay in China for 
three days, the longest stay during his visit to Asia.  However, why 
does not Obama visit Indonesia, his step-father's hometown?  The 
U.S. and Indonesia have not reached an agreement on establishing a 
bilateral strategic partnership.  The Indonesia-U.S. relationship 
has not yet been raised to a strategic level.  At the same time, 
Obama realizes that currently there is strong anti-U.S. sentiment in 
Indonesia, so he may wish to wait and visit later.  Obama may visit 
Indonesia next year to establish a strategic partnership, which will 
have far-reaching influence on U.S.-East Asia relations.  Better 
relations with Indonesia, a country with the largest Muslim 
population in the world, can help the U.S. to improve its image in 
the Muslim world and may help in resolving the Afghanistan and 
Israel-Palestine issues for the U.S." 
 
¶2.  NORTH KOREA 
 
"The U.S. media believes North Korea is not a paper tiger" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(10/14)(pg 16): "The Chinese Foreign Ministry 
Spokesperson said that China believes the launch of five short-range 
missiles by North Korea will not impact steps to alleviate the 
situation on the Korean peninsula.  Dai Xu, a Chinese military 
expert, said that North Korea is only conducting regular military 
activities to show its independence and to express its feelings, 
which reveals the complexity of the North Korea nuclear issue.  The 
launch will not negatively impact the international situation.  Lu 
Chao at Liao Ning Academy of Social Science believed that North 
Korea was not purposefully trying to increase tension. North Korea's 
motive may have been to demonstrate its might to South Korea, 
however the timing of the missile launch is odd and makes people 
wonder about North Korea's true motive." 
 
¶3.  CHINA-JAPAN RELATIONS 
 
"It is very important for China to maintain good relations with 
multiple Japanese parties to promote a strategic and mutually 
beneficial Sino-Japanese relationship" 
 
Guangdong 21st Century Publishing Company Ltd.'s business newspaper 
21st Century Business Herald (21Shiji Jingji Baodao)(10/14)(pg 3): 
"Lu Yaodong, deputy director of the department of Japanese studies 
at China Academy of Social Science, commented that the Communist 
Party of China has been dedicated to developing good relations with 
Japanese political parties, both the Liberal Democratic Party and 
the  Democratic Party of Japan, whether in office or not, and has 
successfully established formal exchange systems with both. 
Maintaining good relations with multiple Japanese parties is very 
important for pushing forward a strategic and mutually beneficial 
China-Japan relationship.  Professor Sun Zhongtao, at the Party 
School of the Central Committee of the CPC, said that Japan is the 
only victim of nuclear weapons in the 20th century; therefore, it is 
understandable that Japanese politicians consciously promote a 
nuclear-free world.  However, China is different from Japan which is 
under the protection of U.S. nuclear umbrella, and needs to have the 
most basic nuclear deterrent force.  Therefore, nuclear disarmament 
is not an issue for China."
