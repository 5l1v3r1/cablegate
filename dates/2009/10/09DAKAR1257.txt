SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.  SUMMARY.  On September 17, post declared a disaster due to the 
effects of severe flooding throughout Senegal (reftel).  In 
response, USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance 
(USAID/OFDA) has provided USD 50,000 in emergency assistance to 
date.  However, limited Government of Senegal (GoS) efforts to 
assist severely flood-affected populations in urban and peri-urban 
areas of the capital, Dakar, as well as limited relief efforts in 
rural areas, could necessitate additional assistance in the weeks to 
come.  Accordingly, post re-declares a disaster for Fiscal Year (FY) 
2010 due to ongoing humanitarian needs.  END SUMMARY. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
CURRENT FLOOD EFFECTS AND RESPONSE EFFORTS 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶2.  On September 17, post declared a disaster (reftel) due to 
extensive flooding that has persisted in urban and rural areas since 
mid-August, including Dakar, Pikine, Rufisque, and Guediawaye 
departments, all in Dakar Region, and Diourbel, Kaffrine, Kaolack, 
Kedougou, Kolda, Matam, Saint Louis, Sedhiou, Tambacounda, and Thies 
regions.  Relief agencies identify water, sanitation, and hygiene 
(WASH) interventions and provision of shelter as the primary 
humanitarian needs throughout flood-affected areas. 
 
¶3.  According to the GoS, the floods at their height affected as 
many as 720,000 people, the highest total of any West African 
nation.  However, due to receding flood waters in areas of Dakar 
city, the GoS estimates a total of approximately 370,000 
flood-affected people as of September 30, including 350,000 people 
in Dakar Region -- the vast majority in Pikine Department -- and 
20,000 people in other parts of Senegal.  Floods have affected more 
than 9,000 people in Kaolack Region, central Senegal, and more than 
6,000 people in Kolda Region, southern Senegal.  In Kedougou Region, 
southern Senegal, rising water levels in the Gambia River have 
flooded Kedougou town and surrounding agricultural areas, and in 
Saint Louis Region, northern Senegal, residents have abandoned three 
flooded villages. 
 
¶4.  To date, the majority of relief efforts have focused on urban 
and peri-urban areas of Dakar.  USAID/Senegal reports that local 
communes, community members, and relief agencies -- rather than the 
GoS -- are currently conducting the bulk of relief efforts.  In 
Pikine East, the most heavily-affected section of Pikine Department, 
relief agencies are conducting WASH activities to mitigate the 
effects of stagnant flood waters, contaminated water sources, and a 
non-functioning sewage system.  While local communes have mobilized 
pumps and work crews to drain flood waters, the combination of 
continued rainfall, a shallow water table, and poor drainage makes 
water removal extremely difficult.  Relief agencies express concern 
regarding the potential spread of waterborne diseases in 
flood-affected urban, peri-urban, and rural areas. 
 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
USG EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE AND ONGOING NEEDS ASSESSMENTS 
--------------------------------------------- --------- 
 
¶5.  In response to the floods to date, USAID/OFDA has provided USD 
 
DAKAR 00001257  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
50,000 through USAID/Senegal to Catholic Relief Services for WASH 
activities and the provision of equipment and supplies for the flood 
victims in Pikine East.  USAID/OFDA and USAID/Senegal continue to 
meet with relief agencies to assess humanitarian conditions and 
identify gaps in the emergency response, both in areas of Pikine 
Department not yet covered by relief efforts and in other parts of 
the country.  In response to a request from the mayor of Saint Louis 
city, USAID/Senegal and USAID/OFDA staff plan to meet with city 
officials on October 5 to ascertain the extent of flood damages and 
humanitarian needs in the region.

RENEWAL OF DISASTER DECLARATION FOR FY 2010 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  Given the scope of ongoing humanitarian needs, and pursuant to 
Section 062, Volume 2, of the Foreign Affairs Manual and USAID ADS 
251, post hereby renews the disaster declaration in response to the 
floods for FY 2010.  Post finds that it is in the best interests of 
the USG to provide continued assistance in response to the disaster 
and that it is beyond the capacity of the host government to provide 
adequate support to flood-affected populations.  Local authorities 
have requested assistance, and post finds that the GoS will accept 
continued USG assistance.  The USAID/OFDA regional office in Dakar 
continues to monitor the situation in conjunction with USAID/Senegal 
and humanitarian partners to clarify needs.
