II. COMPLETED ACTIONS FOR REPORTING PERIOD (KABUL, AFGHANISTAN): 
 
¶A. Site Assessments and Meetings held during this Reporting Period. 
 
¶1. (U) During this report period the EXBS staff and the Senior 
Consultant and Project Manager for Commonwealth Trading Partners, 
Mr. Toomas Raba held a five-day consultation visit in Kabul with 
Afghan Government officials to discuss legislative development 
assistance with representatives from the Afghan Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Ministry of Commerce, Afghan Customs, Afghan Border Police, 
and Afghan Ministry of Justice.  This consultation visit is the 
fifth in a series of consultations that will provide advice and 
guidance to the GIRiA leading to the completion of draft export 
control legislation that satisfies international standards including 
the requirements of UNSCR 1540. 
 
¶2. (U) During this report period the EXBS Advisor met with the 
construction company contracted to refurbish two secure rooms at the 
Ministry of Commerce and Industry. The rooms will house some of the 
computers and servers for a computer based licensing systems EXBS

contract to include a second window and rerouting the wiring under 
the new insulated flooring. The EXBS Advisor approved the 
modifications. A representative of the company installing the 
licensing system was supposed to install the hardware and software 
by November 19, 2009.  However, all visitors staying over thirty 
days in Afghanistan per year must attend two one-week security 
awareness training programs prior to travel. This pushes back the 
project installation phase to January, 2010 
 
¶3. (U) During this report period the EXBS staff visited the Afghan 
Customs Inland Customs Depot (ICD) to meet with a contractor to 
discuss the completion of warranty work on two 13.5 ton forklifts 
prior to shipment to Islam Qalah and Towr Khan border crossing 
points.  The warranty work is scheduled to be completed before

¶4. (U) During this report period the EXBS staff assisted six Afghan 
Government officials to obtain U.S. visas to attend a two-week 
export control workshop at the University of Georgia in Athens, 
Georgia, and a three-day consultation visit in Washington D.C from 
October 25 to November 14, 2009.  Unfortunately three were unable to 
provide their documents and applications on time and were not 
granted visas.  EXBS Program Coordinator, Roohullah Shekaib will 
accompany the delegation. 
 
 
¶5. (U) During this report period the EXBS Advisor attended three 
Border Coordination Meetings and one Border Management Working Group

proposal submitted by Dr. Malik.  EXBS requested that Dr.Malik 
submit a proposal for providing a nuclear, chemical, explosives and 
radiation safety train-the-trainer program to twenty Afghan Customs

comprehensive and expensive.  EXBS will work with Dr. Malik to make 
the proposal more realistic.

assist the Afghan Government in drafting an Export Control Law that 
conforms to international standards.  The next visit will be 
scheduled in December.

¶1. None 
 
 
III. RED FLAG ISSUES: 
 
¶1. (U) Three Afghan Government Officials scheduled to attend a 
two-week Export Control Workshop at the University of Georgia and a 
three-day consultative visit in WADC was denied visas. The visas 
were denied because, despite repeated request over a two-month 
period, the Afghans failed to complete their visa applications and 
submit their documents to the Embassy Consular section in a timely 
fashion.  While the Embassy Consular section will work with us to 
its best ability, the average processing time for Afghan visas is 2 
- 3 weeks.
