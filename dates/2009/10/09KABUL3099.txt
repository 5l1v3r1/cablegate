¶1. (U) Summary:  The landing gear of a Safi Airways Boeing 737 
flying Oct. 3 from Dubai to Kabul caught fire immediately upon 
landing at Kabul International Airport (KIA).  No passengers were 
injured and the crew quickly and safely evacuated the plane. 
Foreign Minister Spanta was on the flight, returning from the United 
Nations General Assembly; he was next to the President of Safi Air. 
Airport emergency crews reacted promptly to the fire, but were 
unable to move the plane.  As a result Kabul's single runway was 
blocked for three hours.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (U) According to Safi Airways President Tilmann Gabriel, who was 
a passenger on the plane, the left landing gear of the Dubai - Kabul 
flight locked and caught fire following touchdown Oct. 3 in Kabul. 
Ministry of Transportation and Civil Aviation (MOTCA) inspectors 
contracted via the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) 
preliminarily found an anti-skid system failure caused the left main 
wheels to lock during landing, resulting in brake overheating and 
tire failure.  Gabriel could not provide details of the plane's 
maintenance history but said Safi replaces tires more frequently 
than required due to the rough runway surface at KIA. 
 
¶3. (U) ISAF fire fighters quickly responded and recommended 
passengers evacuate.  Gabriel said all passengers were off the plane 
within five minutes.  He and Spanta, who were seated in business 
class, were the last to exit.  All passengers were evacuated through 
the rear exit after wind flipped over the inflated forward exit 
slide. 
 
¶4. (U) Due to severe tire damage, the plane could not taxi off the 
runway after the fire was extinguished.  Afghan National Police 
cordoned off the area while Safi maintenance staff replaced the 
tire.  The repair work closed the sole runway at KIA for more than 
three hours, delaying commercial and cargo flights.  (Note: no 
combat flights use KIA.  End note.)  Two Embassy Air and one INL Air 
flights were diverted to Bagram Air Field. 
 
¶5. (U) According to Gabriel, Foreign Minister Spanta called the 
chairman of Safi's board Oct. 5 to compliment the crew on its 
efficient reaction.  The plane returned to service within 24 hours. 
Ministry of Transportation inspectors are completing their 
investigation of the incident.
