Following is an action request. 
 
¶1. Embassy Jakarta is formally requesting Department of Defense 
assistance.  We ask that the Department forward this request to DOD 
as quickly as possible. 
 
¶2. At the request of the Government of Indonesia, Embassy Jakarta is 
requesting: 
 
* That the US C-130 which is in Indonesia for Exercise Teak Iron be 
granted a change of mission.  The exercise should be cancelled and 
the C-130 should start flying supplies to Padang. 
 
* That a HARRT and field hospital (people, supplies, and equipment) 
be sent. 
 
* That the USS Ronald Reagan be diverted to Padang.   This would be 
primarily for its fresh water and electrical power generation 
capabilities. 
 
* That a HAST be deployed. 
 
* That you consider, per GOI request, sending generators, gasoline 
to power the generators and heavy excavation equipment. 
 
¶3. DAO Crisis Action Team point of contact for this request is Col 
Richard C. Stockton at stocktonrc@state.gov and by phone: office -
