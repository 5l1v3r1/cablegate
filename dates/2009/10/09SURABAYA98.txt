SUBJECT: BALI'S JEMBRANA REGENCY: A MODEL OF EFFICIENCY 
 
Summary 
------- 
¶1.  The Regency of Jembrana is recognized as a model for 
decentralization by prominent Indonesian media outlets, 
including Tempo.  On a recent trip by Chargi d'Affaires Ted 
Osius to Jembrana, Jembrana's Regent, Prof Winasa, demonstrated 
the Regency's use of technology to improve operational 
efficiency and reduce opportunities for corruption.  Through 
savings resulting from improved efficiencies and reduced 
corruption, the Regency has offered increased social services to 
its residents.  End summary. 
 
Context 
------- 
¶2.  Jembrana Regency has a population of 220,000.  It is located 
in the western part of Bali and consists of 51 villages.  The 
Regency's capital is Negara.  Unlike Bali's tourism centers, the 
economy is primarily agricultural, although the Regency is also 
home to Bali's primary fishing port and a bustling ferry 
terminal linking Bali to East Java.  Prof Dr. Drg.I. Gede 
Winasa, Regent of Jembrana, was elected Regent in 2000 and 
re-elected in 2005 with 88% of the vote, a record percentage for 
any election in Indonesia. 
 
Chargi Osius Visits Jembrana Regent 
----------------------------------- 
¶3.  On a recent visit to Jembrana by Chargi d'Affaires Ted 
Osius, the Regent noted that inefficiency is itself a form of 
corruption.  To raise efficiency in the Regency, he has focused 
on standardization of operations and processes through 
technology.  For example, Jembrana is the first in Indonesia to 
implement touch-screen voting machines for their elections. 
Time clocks for government employees use biometrics 
(fingerprints) as a way to ensure employees are on-the-job.  The 
Regency has also established a central command center where 
officials can connect immediately by video-conference to all 
schools and offices in the Regency.  SMS (text messaging) 
systems are employed as a way for constituents to contact the 
government and for the government to send mass communications to 
Jembrana residents.  This system would prove valuable during an 
earthquake or other emergency. 
 
Less Opportunity for Corruption 
------------------------------- 
¶4.  Standardized operating procedures and the use of 
technological advancements have helped the Regency reduce 
opportunities for corruption.  For example, all construction 
permits are submitted through an automated system in which the 
person responsible for reviewing permit applications is unknown 
to the applicants.  This greatly reduces the possibility of 
bribery and collusion.  The Regency waiting room uses a 
computerized system so that no one can pay to move to the head 
of the line.  These simple process improvements have 
significantly reduced the opportunities for low-level corruption. 
 
Real Changes in People's Lives 
------------------------------ 
¶5.  The results of the Regency's operational improvements are 
seen in all facets of people's lives.  Since 2002, the Regency 
has supplied free schooling for all children in the Regency 
through 12th grade.  The Regency supplies free basic health care 
services to the population through the hospital and several 
clinics.  The PAD (regional revenue), which is derived primarily 
from the collection of regional taxes, for Jembrana has 
increased from 2.3 billion Rp. per year to 8.5 billion Rp. per 
year during Prof Winasa's tenure.  Jembrana used the authority 
provided by decentralization to make practical changes and 
improve the quality of life of its residents.
