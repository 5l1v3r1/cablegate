REF: SECSTATE 97637 
 
¶1.  Embassy San Jose fully supports the Overseas Private 
Investment Corporation's (OPIC) plan to provide a USD 55 
million loan to Alterra Partners Costa Rica, S.A. (APCR), the 
operator of San Jose's Juan Santamaria International Airport 
(SJO).  The loan -) in addition to a USD 45 million 
Inter-American Development Bank loan -- will finance the 
purchase of APCR shares by the new operators (or "sponsors," 
Brazil's Andrade Gutierrez Concessoes and ADC/HAS -) a joint 
venture of Canada's Airport Development Corporation and the 
U.S.'s HAS Development Corporation), construction work of USD 
30 million for completing expansion phases I and II, 
repayment of an International Finance Corporation (IFC) loan, 
and payment of outstanding penalties due to past contract 
disputes. 
 
------------------------ 
ONGOING EMBASSY INTEREST 
------------------------ 
 
¶2.  We have followed the contract problems and related 
construction delays associated with the expansion and 
operation of SJO for over five years.  As a result, we have 
monitored the situation through our contacts with ADC/HAS, 
the IFC, Alterra, OPIC, Costa Rica's Civil Aviation 
Authority, and the Ministry of Finance.  We fully endorse 
OPIC's careful and cautious negotiations with the GOCR in 
order to produce a "contract with clarity and predictability." 
 
--------------------- 
RECENT COUNTRY EVENTS 
--------------------- 
 
¶3. The global economic crisis impacted Costa Rica primarily 
in the form of decreased economic activity and unemployment 
in select sectors of the economy, notably tourism, 
construction (particularly activity devoted to resort 
development, both residential and hospitality), and 
manufacturing.  In contrast to this trend, economic activity 
and employment in the areas of professional services and 
medical devices (development and assembly) continues apace. 
Overall, the global crisis has dragged down the Costa Rican 
economy as demand in export markets contracted.  Predictions 
on gross domestic product growth for the year currently vary 
between 0 percent and -1 percent or, at worst, -2 percent. 
Forecasters estimate unemployment at less than 7 percent.

2009 TOURIST TRENDS REFLECT THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE 
--------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶4.  From 2007 to 2008, tourist arrivals in Costa Rica edged 
upward from 1,979,800 to 2,089,200, an increase of 5.5 
percent.  This followed a robust increase of 14.8 percent 
from 2006 to 2007.  Most interesting, the trend of US 
visitors from 2007 to 2008 -) which reached 776,600 in 2008 
(47 percent of overall visits) )- increased at a higher 
rate, 23.6 percent, than the overall rate of visits.  For the 
first six months of 2009, the impact of the economic crisis 
squarely hit the overall visit figures with overall visits 
dropping by 9.5 percent to 425,000 through June 2009.

LOOKING UPWARD? 
--------------- 
 
¶5.  Airport traffic and thus revenue correlates directly to 
tourism traffic which for 2009 lags behind 2008.  In July, we 
met then Tourism Minister Carlos Benavides and Director 
Hermes Navarro.  They told us that the tourism industry 
suffered a significant setback during the latter half of 2008 
and the first half of 2009 (as reflected in official 
figures).  However, industry players indicated to our 
interlocutors that the downward trend in tourism business may 
have reached the inflection point, suggesting that the 
business had "bottomed-out."  This prediction makes for 
cautious optimism and would represent the potential for 
growing numbers of tourists and airline passengers arriving 
at SJO in late 2009 or starting in 2010.
