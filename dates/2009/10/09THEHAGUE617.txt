SUBJECT: CWC:  AMHET UZUMCU OF TURKEY NOMINATED BY 
CONSENSUS TO BE NEXT OPCW DIRECTOR-GENERAL 
 
REF: STATE 107329 
 
Classified By: Robert Mikulak for reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 
 
This is CWC-60-09. 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Ambassador Ahmet Uzumcu (Turkish Perm Rep 
to the UN Office in Geneva) received a consensus nomination 
by 
the 41-member Executive Council to be the next Director- 
General (DG) of the Organization for the Prohibition of 
Chemical Weapons (OPCW).  The nomination occurred on Friday, 
October 16, after Ambassador Peter Gottwald (Germany) and 
Ambassador Benchaa Dani (Algeria) withdrew their candidacies 
and endorsed Uzumcu.  Uzumcu's consensus nomination will now 
be forwarded to the Fourteenth Session of the Conference of 
the States Parties (November 30-December 3), where it is 
expected to be approved.  Uzumcu will assume office not later 
than July 25, 2010 when the term of the current DG (Rogelio 
Pfirter, Argentina) expires.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The DG contest unexpectedly came to a rapid 
conclusion following five straw polls over the period of 
October 9-16.  The key event occurred immediately before 
straw 
poll number 5 (November 15) when the UK delegation announced 
that London was withdrawing the candidacy of Mr. John Freeman 
(current Deputy Director-General).  In straw poll number 5, 
all of Freeman's first place votes (six) surprisingly went to 
Uzumcu )- Gottwald picked up none.  This gave Uzumcu a total 
of 21 first place votes, to Gottwald's nine, and Dani's 
eleven.  (In the event of a formal vote in the EC, 28 votes 
would have been necessary to obtain the required two-thirds 
majority.)  With the outcome clear, Gottwald and Dani were 
persuaded by EC Chair Ambassador Lomonaco (Mexico) and others 
to support Uzumcu, rather than continue to drag the process 
out to a politically messy conclusion. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The first three straw polls showed consistency with 
Uzumcu holding a steady lead in first place votes over all 
other candidates.  However, no candidates withdrew before the 
beginning of the EC. Following the third straw poll on 
October 
13, the first during the Council session, Ambassador Aapo 
Polho (Finland) and Ambassador Anton Thalman (Switzerland) 
jointly withdrew their candidacies.  The next day, just 
before 
the fourth poll Indonesia announced that Ambassador Sudjadnan 
was also withdrawing.  After the fourth straw poll on October 
14, Uzumcu carried zero "no votes" for the first time.  In 
other words, all 41 members of the Council supported him as 
either their first, second, or third place candidate.  The 
Qeither their first, second, or third place candidate.  The 
other remaining candidates (Dani, Gottwald, Freeman) each 
carried 12 or more "no votes." 
 
¶4. (SBU) Ambassador Dani deserves much praise for his 
graceful 
and diplomatic exit, which he couched more around his support 
for Uzumcu, than his own withdrawal.  Informal discussions on 
the margins indicate fairly wide support for an African 
Deputy 
Director-General, perhaps from Algeria (though it will not be 
Ambassador Dani).  The Deputy Director-General is chosen by 
the Director-General and not by the Executive Council. 
 
 
¶5. (C) Discussions on the margins indicate that Uzumcu picked 
up all of Freeman's first place votes, which came primarily 
from other EU countries.  While the reasons for this 
surprising development and the friction within the European 
Union over this issue is not yet known, it is clear that the 
inability of the German and UK candidates (and their 
capitals) 
to work out an acceptable compromise doomed both candidacies 
and worked to Uzumcu's favor. 
 
¶6. (U) MIKULAK SENDS.
