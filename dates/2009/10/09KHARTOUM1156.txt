SUBJECT:  Drought Threatens Livelihoods in North Darfur 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary:  U.N. field staff predict that low rain levels 
recorded this year may trigger displacement, increase reliance on 
humanitarian assistance, and heighten inter-community competition 
for scarce water resources.  End summary.

NO RAIN, NO HARVEST 
------------------- 
 
¶2.  (U) The 2009 rainy season started late compared to 2008.  The 
North Darfur Food Security and Livelihood Working Group has reported 
temporally and spatially erratic rains.  Although August is usually 
the peak period for rains, large areas of North Darfur reported 
prolonged dry spells with the exception of Kebkabiya and Liait 
localities.  Below average rainfall was observed in areas near 
Malha, Mellit, Kutum, and El Fasher towns.  Below average rains not 
only threaten cultivation, but also affect water table 
replenishment, access to safe drinking water, and pasture for 
pastoralists. 
 
¶3.  (U) On October 1, U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) staff reported 
to USAID that as of the end of August, 109 mm of rain had been 
recorded in North Darfur.  UNICEF staff confirmed continued minimal 
rain through September.  The rainy season in North Darfur typically 
occurs between late June and the end of September and delivers an 
average of 150mm of rain.  UNICEF staff further noted that for the 
last two years, North Darfur recorded 250 mm of rain between June 
and September. 
 
¶4.  (U) UNICEF staff noted with alarm that a newly-built water 
catchment facility, designed to support the water table and serve 
for non-human water use at Zam Zam Internally Displaced Persons 
(IDP) camp, is empty, and nine water pumps in Abu Shouk and Al 
Salaam IDP camps are dry.  Other IDP camps and rural villages have 
also reported water shortages. 
 
¶5.  (U) The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) also met 
with USAID on October 1 and confirmed the early termination of rains 
in North Darfur.  A post-harvest assessment is due to begin in 
November, but the latest maps already show a worrying pattern 
developing across the region.  FAO provided seeds and tools to 
85,000 households in North Darfur through ten implementing partners 
in 2009, but is not optimistic about yields because of the rains. 
FAO also noted that the expulsion of 13 international NGOs in March 
2009, following President Bashir's indictment by the International 
Criminal Court, presented a significant loss of expertise in the 
agriculture, livestock, and food security sectors. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Comment:  While Government of National Unity (GNU) 
officials and other policymakers have been debating IDP returnee 
numbers, U.N. field staff in North Darfur predict a significant 
water shortage in the coming months, potentially attracting 
additional populations to urban centers.  In North Darfur, the 
fragile environmental balance, numerous livestock, and likely poor 
harvest may complicate the humanitarian response for 2010.  In 
addition, competition for scare resources could trigger clashes 
between farmers and herders in North Darfur.  Humanitarian staff may 
take a water management role in working with IDPs and host 
communities to avoid further deterioration of already tense 
relations.  However, African Union-U.N. Hybrid Operations in Darfur 
(UNAMID) and humanitarian agency presence could place additional 
pressure on limited water resources in North Darfur.  End comment.
