SUBJECT: Embassy Outreach to Minister Khan of Energy and Water 
 
¶1. Meeting with Afghan Water and Energy Minister Mohammed Ismail 
Khan October 13, Coordinating Director for Development and Economic 
Affairs, Ambassador E. Anthony Wayne, highlighted two new 
initiatives.  (Discussions of politics reported setpel.)  The first 
was USAID's recent launch of a four-year, $83 million program to 
support the Afghan Government in designing and installing 
community-based renewable energy systems, such as micro-hydro, wind, 
or solar.  The program will provide over 300 communities with 
renewable energy systems, particularly in the southern and eastern 
regions of the country.  The second program is a new USAID $52 
million program that will help the Afghan Government increase access 
to potable water, sanitation facilities and hygiene behavior.  This 
program will benefit over 1,000 communities, also in the South and 
East. 
 
¶2. Ambassador Wayne also conveyed the USG's interest to work with 
the Minister and his staff to identify and design three to five 
signature multipurpose (irrigation/small hydro) dams programs and 
noted the need to do survey various locations  throughout the 
country as possible project sites. 
 
¶3. In response, Minister Khan specifically requested assistance in a 
critical area of the North -- in Jawsjan Province -- which has not 
been able to find/develop a proper source of ground water.  Noting 
approximately 100,000 people or more live in the area, Khan proposed 
building a 105 kilometer water transmission line to take in the Amu 
Darya River and bring it to the area.  The Minister estimated that 
the initiative would cost approximately $15 million.  The Minister 
agreed that Water and Energy Ministry staff and Mission 
infrastructure team experts should meet for follow-up discussions on 
this request.
