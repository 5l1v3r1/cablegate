     ¶B. SANAA 1532 
 
THIS MESSAGE IS SENSITIVE, BUT UNCLASSIFIED.  PLEASE TREAT 
ACCORDINGLY. 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY. UN Emergency Relief Coordinator John Holmes 
intends to travel to Yemen on/about October 8 to observe UN 
agency responses to the Houthi conflict in the northern 
Sa'ada province of Yemen.  The Department requests that USUN 
approach Mr. Holmes in advance of his visit to relay the 
importance the U.S. Government places on UN agency activities 
in Yemen and our expectation that he will be vocal and 
forthright with his assessment of the situation.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Background: There may be as many as 150,000 
internally displaced persons (IDPs), of whom approximately 
95,000 were displaced before the latest round of fighting, in 
northern Yemen.  The number of IDPs may continue to grow. 
Access to IDPs is very limited by the fighting and the Yemeni 
government itself has been unable to keep open lines of 
communication to Sa'ada.  The Yemeni and Saudi governments 
have reportedly agreed to allow UNHCR to deliver aid and 
supplies from Saudi Arabia to IDPs located on the Yemeni side 
of the border.  The Department is supportive of these efforts 
and has lobbied both sides on the UN's behalf.  We continue 
to call for a ceasefire to the conflict to allow for the 
delivery of humanitarian supplies and for both sides to 
respect their international obligations to protect civilians 
and relief workers. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Background continued:  There is limited press 
reporting due to the insecurity in the conflict zone, and the 
U.S. government is concerned that the Yemeni government will 
take the limited attention as license to continue its war 
efforts without respect for protecting the civilian and IDP 
population. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Begin Talking Points: 
 
-- The U.S. government is deeply concerned by the 
deteriorating situation in northern Yemen.  The ferocity of 
the conflict and remoteness of the region endangers the 
civilian population and complicates access for humanitarian 
assistance.  The lack of information means it is difficult to 
ascertain the conditions of vulnerable populations. 
 
-- Your visit provides the first opportunity since the sixth 
round of fighting began August 12 to highlight the UN,s 
concerns about the Sa,ada war and bring its worrisome 
humanitarian dimensions and destabilizing potential to the 
attention of the international community. 
 
-- We are eager to see the UN take greater efforts to make 
public the humanitarian impact of the conflict and to push 
the Yemeni government and Houthi rebels to create the 
conditions for safe passage of humanitarian goods and workers 
to enter into the conflict zone. 
 
-- Should you assess the situation to be critical, a public 
statement of concern from the UN regarding the growing 
humanitarian crisis and a call for both parties to cease 
hostilities and return to the principles of the Doha 
Agreement as a basis for bringing the conflict to an end 
would help us pressure the Yemeni government to seek a 
lasting ceasefire and to address some regional grievances 
through dialogue. 
 
-- Should you be interested, our Embassy in Sana'a is 
available to brief you on our assessment of the situation in 
greater detail. 
 
-- We would also appreciate your frank assessment of the 
situation upon your return.
