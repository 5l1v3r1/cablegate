¶1. (SBU) Summary.  Ukrainian Minister of Health Vasiliy Knyazevich 
confirmed this morning that Ukraine is experiencing an A-H1N1 
epidemic.  In response, Prime Minister Tymoshenko announced that all 
schools in Ukraine will be closed for three weeks, large public 
meetings will be cancelled, nine regions in western Ukraine with 
particularly heavy flu outbreaks will be quarantined, and the 
government will consider limiting the movement of people within the 
country.  Meanwhile, lines have reportedly been forming at 
pharmacies throughout the country, as people stock up on medical 
supplies.  End Summary. 
 
H1N1 CONFIRMED 
-------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Ukrainian Minister of Health Vasiliy Knyazevich confirmed 
this morning that preliminary results show an A-H1N1 epidemic has 
started in Ukraine.  This confirmation, based on test results from 
Kyiv laboratories, came on the heels of an "unknown" flu outbreak in 
the Ternopil, Ivano-Frankivsk, and Lviv oblasts in western Ukraine. 
So far, at least 37 deaths have been reported, with thousands of 
other people seeking treatment.  Knyazevich stopped short of 
confirming that all deaths were caused by A-H1N1 but said that at 
least one fatality has been traced back to the virus.  Ukraine has 
sent samples to laboratories in the U.K. for further confirmation of 
the type of virus that is spreading among the population.  Test 
results will reportedly be released on or about November 3. 
 
QUARANTINE IN NINE REGIONS 
-------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) Following a meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers on October 30 
to discuss the A-H1N1 outbreak, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko said 
the government has allocated UAH50 million to prevent the spread of 
the virus and announced a number of preventive measures.  According 
to Tymoshenko, educational institutions including kindergartens, 
schools, and universities in all Ukraine will be closed for three 
weeks, and nine regions in western Ukraine with particularly heavy 
flu outbreaks will be quarantined.  As part of the quarantine, large 
public events like church services, concerts and movie showings will 
be cancelled.  The quarantine may be extended to the entire country 
should the situation deteriorate.  The government also plans to 
introduce a "special regime" to limit the movement of people within 
the country.  In addition, Ukraine will seek help from the World 
Health Organization (WHO) and other international organizations to 
help it combat the epidemic, Minister of Health Knyazevich said. 
 
SHORTAGES OF MEDICATIONS REPORTED 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) According to news reports and eyewitness accounts, people 
in the most affected regions but also in Kyiv have begun to stock up 
on mediations and surgical masks.  Lines have been forming outside 
of some pharmacies, and people have reportedly been unable to buy 
anti-viral drugs and cold medicines, as stores quickly run out of 
supplies.  PM Tymoshenko warned pharmacies against raising prices 
and suggested that the government would cancel the licenses of 
pharmacies that try to gouge customers.  She also proposed that for 
a certain period of time all health care establishments, state and 
private, be managed by the Ministry of Health. 
 
COMMENT: 
-------- 
 
¶5. (SBU) We are seeking to confirm details of how the government 
intends to implement the measures announced by PM Tymoshenko today, 
especially concerning quarantines and possible limitations on 
movement of people within the country.  We will continue monitoring 
developments of the outbreak and the government's response.  The 
Embassy's consular section has prepared a warden message to be sent 
to U.S. citizens in Ukraine.
