INSISTS THERE IS NO CAUSE FOR CONCERN 
 
¶1. (U) Press sources report that on Wednesday, 28 October a 
mishap at an oil field on Madura Island, East Java Province 
caused a well to begin spurting water, mud, and gas, raising the 
specter of a repeat of the Lapindo mud disaster in Sidoarjo. 
The well is operated by oil company SPE Petroleum, a subsidiary 
of the China National Petroleum Corporation.  According to press 
reports, the leak has begun to inundate rice fields adjacent to 
the well. 
 
¶2. (U) In an official statement to the press, SPE operational 
manager Akhmadi Sabidi claimed that the mud spraying from the 
well is "not dangerous" and is "a common incident in Madura." 
He emphasized that source of the mud is 20 meters below the 
surface, and as such is easily contained.  Amin Widodo, a 
geologist at the Surabaya Institute of Technology (ITS), 
confirmed that the oil reservoirs under northern east Java and 
Madura have high mud content and that it is not uncommon for an 
oil well to spurt mud.  Amin also confirmed that mud coming from 
a 20-meter depth is easily contained.  ConGen Surabaya will 
closely monitor the situation.
