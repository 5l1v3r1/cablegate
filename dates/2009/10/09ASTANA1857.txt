¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  During lunch on October 15, Doulat Kuanyshev, 
Kazakhstan's Ambassador-at-Large for OSCE Issues, described 
Kazakhstan's special state commission for the OSCE and again pressed 
the Ambassador for an OSCE summit in 2010.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Doulat Kuanyshev, Kazakhstan's Ambassador-at-Large, whose 
portfolio includes OSCE Issues, and a former Ambassador to Paris and 
Vienna, told the Ambassador on October 15 that he is responsible for 
areas within the OSCE with the potential for conflict, especially 
the states of the former Yugoslavia (minus Slovenia).  At the 
moment, he does not have an official OSCE appointment, but 
Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister, Kanat Saudabayev, could 
institutionalize an OSCE position for him once Kazakhstan assumes 
the Chairmanship.  Kuanyshev confirmed Kazakhstan plans to appoint 
the current Secretary-General of the Shanghai Cooperation 
Organization (SCO), Bolat Nurgaliev, as the OSCE Special 
Representative on Protracted Conflicts once his SCO responsibilities 
end January 1, 2010. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) According to Kuanyshev, President Nazarbayev created a 
special state commission for the OSCE to coordinate issues during 
Kazakhstan's Chairmanship.  This inter-agency body, headed by 
Foreign Minister Saudabayev, includes the Ministries of Defense, 
National Security (KNB), Internal Affairs, Transportation and 
Communications, Energy and Mineral Resources, Industry and Trade, 
Culture and Information, Environment, Education and Science, and 
Health.  The Foreign Minister will brief, and Presidential Foreign 
Policy Adviser Kairat Sarybai will advise, President Nazarbayev on 
guidance provided by the special commission.  Security Council 
Secretary Marat Tazhin, Prime Minister Karim Masimov, and Head of 
the Presidential Administration Aslan Musin will also be involved. 
Kuanyshev described the special commission as designed to provide 
internally for Kazakhstan "checks and balances, both of institutions 
and personalities." 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Kuanyshev predicted Kazakhstan will preserve a "continuity 
on OSCE priorities, with a bit more emphasis on topical, pivotal 
issues."  He said that Saudabayev is especially focused on making 
the OSCE relevant internally for Kazakhstan, and "not just on the 
external projection of Kazakhstan's image."  Continuing Kazakhstan's 
push for a summit (ref A), Kuanyshev stated that the OSCE needs an 
"event," and equated a successful Chairmanship with a summit.  He 
pointed to the change in U.S. administrations as a source of 
optimism due to its "new, inclusive, participatory style."  The 
Ambassador replied that both Kazakhstan's Foreign Minister and its 
Ambassador to the United States have been pressing this idea, which 
the U.S. government is currently examining.  Kuanyshev prodded, "The 
OSCE is a game where everyone should win."  Kuanyshev concluded, 
"The OSCE needs a summit.  Where and when is not critical for 
Kazakhstan." 
 
¶6.  (SBU) On potential summit topics, the Ambassador stated that the 
United States does not agree an OSCE summit, should there be one, 
should address European security architecture, because the Corfu 
process is the appropriate venue for that discussion.  Kuanyshev 
responded that Kazakhstan understands the U.S. position, but 
believes that other potential issues exist on which Kazakhstan could 
show leadership, such as Afghanistan or inter-ethnic/inter-religious 
tolerance.  Kuanyshev commented that the topic of Afghanistan could 
show Kazakhstan's "cooperative style, intentions, and its efforts on 
Afghanistan in terms of education (ref B)."  At the same time, he 
said, Kazakhstan is determining how to promote its role on 
inter-ethnic and inter-religious issues beyond the "human dimension 
basket." 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Kazakhstan hopes to use its Chairmanship to make "Central 
Asia more central on the OSCE map -- not as a student, but as a

player with problems that it could work to solve, like the Aral 
Sea," Kuanyshev argued.  When the Ambassador replied that some 
regional leaders have expressed frustration of years and years of 
fruitless seminars and studies, Kuanyshev praised President 
Nazarbayev's ability to influence his presidential colleagues 
positively, including in Moscow.  "Political decisions could 
overrule bureaucratic reservations," he claimed.  He noted the 
regular consultations between Kazakhstani Deputy Foreign Minister 
Konstantin Zhigalov and the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister in 
charge of OSCE issues, whom he said was currently in Astana for OSCE 
discussions.
