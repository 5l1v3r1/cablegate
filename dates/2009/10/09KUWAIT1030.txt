(U) Press reports October 28 highlighted that, acting on 
instructions from the Amir, the GOK plans to provide 
treatment in Kuwaiti hospitals for some 20 Iraqis injured in 
the October 25 suicide bombings in Baghdad. Iraqi embassy 
political officer Ahmad Al-Jarba confirmed to Embassy that 
arrangements are being made. Jarba did not have details on 
when or to which hospitals the injured would be transferred, 
but the GOK previously provided medical treatment for some 
two dozen Iraqis following the August 19 Baghdad truck 
bombing (Refs A & B).
