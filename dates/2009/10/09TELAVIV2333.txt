DESIGNATIONS, WELCOMES INPUT 
 
¶1.  (SBU) The Ministerial Committee on National Security 
Affairs (the Security Cabinet) designated 50 Al Qaida and 
Taliban-affiliated groups as terrorist organizations during a 
discussion of "Global Jihad" on 20 October.  These 
designations come as a result of reporting, monitoring and 
enforcement actions as per Israeli laws against 
money-laundering and the financing of terrorism.  Gil Avriel, 
a legal advisor at the National Security Council (NSC), said 
that these designations "are a direct outcome of the long and 
fruitful relationship with both Embassy Tel Aviv and the 
Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control 
(OFAC)."  Avriel thanked the U.S. and OFAC for providing the 
"indispensable" documentation and statements of case that his 
office utilized in preparing designation packages for the 
Cabinet. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Avriel said that the NSC will now work on preparing 
designations of individuals.  (Note: According to GOI law, 
the NSC can present international designations of Al Qaida 
and Taliban-related entities, such as those of the UN or 
U.S., for domestic adoption with minimal additional 
supporting evidence.  The NSC chose to first seek 
designations of groups--a process which this latest round of 
designations completes--before moving onto individuals.  End 
Note.) 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Avriel suggested that if the USG could provide a 
prioritized list of Al Qaida and Taliban-affiliated 
individuals for GOI designation, the NSC would pursue its 
future designations accordingly.
