PROGRAM 
 
On October 19, Cagatay Erciyes, MFA Deputy Director General 
for Maritime and Aviation Affairs, convoked PolMil Counselor 
to pass on a request which he said was important to FM 
Davutoglu.  Erciyes said that the Turkish Air Force had a 
standing request in military channels since 2001 for a 
Turkish Air Force pilot to participate in NASA's work with 
the International Space Station.  Erciyes claimed that 
President Gul had considered raising the issue in his 
telephone call with President Obama over the weekend, but, 
Erciyes said, FM Davutoglu suggested that a standard approach 
through diplomatic channels would be more appropriate. 
Erciyes said, somewhat apologetically,  that the issue had an 
unusually high level of military support and would be raised 
at the next meeting of Turkey's National Security Council. 
2011 would mark the 100th anniversary of Turkey's Air Force 
and the GOT hoped it could mark that year with a space flight 
by a Turkish pilot.  We agreed to pass the request to 
appropriate agencies in Washington.
