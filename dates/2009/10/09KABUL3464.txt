¶1. Responding to a request from the Department of Commerce's Trade 
Advocacy Center, Embassy Kabul has confirmed the bona fides of two 
international firms.  The companies, ANHAM LLC and AIP LLC, have 
formed a joint venture to sub-contract a $10.9 million generator set 
to General Electric's Marine and Stationary Diesel Power Division. 
 
 
¶2. The Afghanistan Investment Support Agency (AISA) solicited bids 
in July, 2009 for an 18 megawatt diesel generator power plant as 
part of a planned World Bank-funded Industrial Park in 
Hissar-e-Shahi near Jalalabad.  World Bank blueprints for the park 
require self-sustained utilities, including power, water supply, 
roads, and waste/wastewater treatment.  AIP-ANHAM's bid on the power 
plant procurement was ranked second in price. 
 
¶3. On October 27, Commercial Officer met with ANHAM Deputy Managing 
Director Kabir Arghandiwal and confirmed ANHAM, which is partially 
American-owned, holds contracts with U.S. Department of Defense, 
Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), and USAID.  We have 
found no derogatory information on ANHAM or its joint venture 
partner AIP. 
 
¶4. Arghandiwal reported that although AISA had begun conducting 
technical evaluations of the bids, the procurement process was now 
on hold and will likely be rebid at a future date.  AISA offered no 
explanation for the potential rebid.  Arghandiwal expects AIP-ANHAM 
to participate in a second bidding round.
