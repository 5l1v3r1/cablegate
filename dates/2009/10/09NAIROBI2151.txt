SUBJECT: SOMALIA - SOMALILAND'S PRESIDENT RIYALE SEEMS TO 
STALL ON ELECTION COUNCIL NOMINEES 
 
REF: NAIROBI 2010 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  In October 9 conversations, opposition 
Kulmiye party Chairman Ahmed Silanyo and UCID opposition 
party Chairman Ali Faisal Warabe told Somalia Unit that they 
and the Council of Elders (Guurti) had nominated their 
combined four candidates to the National Election Council 
(NEC), but that President Riyale had still not announced his 
three nominees.  Warabe and Silanyo suspected that Riyale 
might be attempting to brake progress toward the 
often-postponed presidential elections.  Silanyo admitted, 
however, that lobbying and strategizing by those in Riyale's 
inner circle or among clan elders might be the source of the 
delay. The opposition party Chairmen urged international 
community pressure and reported that they had alerted the 
British Charge in Addis Ababa to Riyale's foot-dragging. 
Ambassador Ranneberger will make our concerns about the 
slower-then-expected pace of the process known to President 
Riyale in a telephone call planned for the weekend of October 
¶9.  End summary. 
 
¶2. (SBU) In an October 9 conversation, Somaliland's UCID 
opposition party Chairman Ali Faisal Warabe told Somalia Unit 
that the Guurti, his party, and the opposition Kulmiye party 
had all nominated their replacement candidates to the 
National Election Council (NEC).  (Note:  Following the 
signing by the three party Chairmen of a six-point framework 
agreement, the incumbent NEC members had resigned.  President 
Riyale's UDUB party was to nominate three replacement NEC 
members, the Guurti was to have nominated two, and the two 
opposition parties were to suggest one nominee each.  End 
note.)  Warabe, while admitting that Riyale was a "very slow 
guy," worried that Riyale's failure to date to nominate could 
be part of a larger strategy to delay progress on the 
election process at every step, thus allowing Riyale to 
remain President as long as possible.  Warabe said he had 
alerted the British Charge John Marshall in Addis Ababa of 
the delay and encouraged his intervention.  Warabe hoped that 
a timetable leading to the elections could be agreed not 
later than October 29.  He said that Kulmiye Chairman Silanyo 
and he would press, at a three-party meeting that could occur 
on October 10, for a strict timetable. 
 
¶3. (SBU)  In a conversation the same day, opposition Kulmiye 
party Chairman Ahmed Silanyo reiterated his belief that the 
key to successful elections was a newly-constituted NEC. 
Silanyo thought it possible that Riyale had delayed 
announcement of his three candidates because he was being 
intensely lobbied, both by his inner circle, and by relevant 
clan elders.  Silanyo said he had urged Riyale on October 8 
to move ahead quickly, before Somalilanders become restive. 
He had told the same to the press, Silanyo said.  Silanyo had 
set his own deadline for Riyale of October 10.  He urged 
international pressure in order to get the President to act. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Embassy has tentatively scheduled a telephone call 
for Ambassador Ranneberger with Riyale for the weekend of 
October 9 in order to underscore the importance of moving 
quickly to elections.
