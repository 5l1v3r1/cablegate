  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  U.S.-CHINA MILITARY RELATIONS 
 
"Increasing trust, eliminating doubts, and friendly cooperation" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao) 
(10/24)(pg 3): "Major General Qian Lihua, Director of the Foreign 
Affairs Office at the Ministry of National Defense, said that since 
President Obama took office several U.S. military delegations have 
been sent to China for discussions on military exchanges.  However, 
so far, these visits have been one-way engagements.  The U.S. has 
shown sincerity in improving China-U.S. military ties and China 
appreciates this.  Whether or not this positive trend can be 
maintained steadily over the long term depends on the U.S.'s 
attitude towards China's core interests, like the Taiwan issue, 
which will be an important political foundation for the development 
of bilateral military relations.  This is a test and both the U.S. 
and China should seize the opportunity and meet the challenge to 
ensure the healthy and stable development of bilateral military 
relations.  As for the military transparency issue, Qian said that 
transparency on 'strategic intentions' is the most important aspect 
of military transparency, and China's strategic intentions are 
completely transparent.  The degree of transparency is also based on 
mutual military trust.  The Chinese government has always paid a 
close attention to military transparency." 
 
¶2.  NORTH KOREA 
 
"Will there be a shift in U.S.-North Korea relations?" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily Overseas Edition(Renmin 
Ribao Haiwaiban)(10/26)(pg 8): "U.S. policy on North Korea is always 
changing since the Obama administration does not believe North Korea 
will give up its nuclear programs.  It may be possible to create an 
opportunity for the U.S. and North Korea to meet at the Northeast 
Asia Cooperation Dialogue forum to prepare for possible bilateral 
talks.  The U.S. and North Korea have had quite different focuses 
with regard to possible bilateral talks.  It remains to be seen 
whether or not the forum can achieve positive results.  On Northeast 
Asia issues, China will insist that all parties respect each other's 
core interests and will support U.S.-North Korea bilateral talks to 
increase mutual trust and understanding.  The Six-Party Talks are 
still in the interest of Northeast Asian nations and the most 
important framework to resolve the impasse in the region." 
 
¶3.  IRAN 
 
"Iran defends its 'nuclear rights' by retreating" 
 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao) (10/26)(pg 6): 
"The international negotiations [over Iran's nuclear program], 
although occasionally seeing positive signs, have not touched on the 
crucial issues, like Iran's suspension of its uranium enrichment 
activities.  Experts believe that there is still a long way to go. 
The series of positive moves made by Iran recently are seen by some 
as an advance strategy of 'retreat'; Iran has not made any promises 
on any of the crucial issues.  Therefore, even if Iran agrees to 
accept [IAEA Director General Mohammed] El-Baradei's nuclear fuel 
deal, there will still not be any breakthrough on the Iranian 
nuclear issue."
