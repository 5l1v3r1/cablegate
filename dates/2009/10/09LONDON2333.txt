Classified By: Political Counselor Robin Quinville, reasons 1.4 (b/d).  

(C/NF) UK Foreign Office West Africa team leader Paul Welsh told poloff October 13 that the UK remains concerned about human rights in The Gambia and the recent conviction of the journalists (reftel).  Welsh said the UK has tried to exert external pressure on President Jammeh, but has to date not found an effective means.  Welsh said The Gambia is "not taking seriously" the EU Article 8 consultations.  No ministers have participated in the dialogue thus far.  Welsh said the UK is not expecting much from the next meeting at the end of November when the EU Presidency will send a representative to Banjul.   Visit London's Classified Website: XXXXXXXXXXXX
