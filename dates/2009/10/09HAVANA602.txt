SUBJECT:  29 SEPTEMBER REPATRIATION OF CUBANS AT CABANAS 
 
¶1. USINT officer transferred 3 Cubans from the 
U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Kodiak Island to Cuban authorities 
on September 29 without incident. 
 
¶2. The Cutter Kodiak Island docked in the Cuban port of Cabanas 
at approximately 10:00 am local time to transfer 
the migrant.  USINT officer briefed the returnees 
and provided standard information packets on legal 
immigration methods.  Officer advised the returnees 
that USINT officers would attempt to contact them 
in the next several months to assess their well 
being, including visiting some Havana-based 
returnees in their homes.  Returnees were also 
advised that they could meet with a U.S. official 
at the Refugee Annex Fridays 10 am to discuss 
specific claims of harm, including retaliatory 
acts such as being unjustly dismissed from 
one's job, being frequently detained by police, 
or being the target of public acts of repudiation. 
 
¶3. No returnees protested the repatriation to 
USINT or USCG personnel.  The cutter departed 
without incident.  The returnees were met by 
Ministry of Foreign Relations (MINREX) and Ministry 
of Interior (MININT) officials for transport to 
a Cuban Processing Center.

repatriated.  Corrections and/or additions are
