¶1.  (SBU) On September 17 Counselor Fabio Vaz Pitaluga, head of the 
Division of Oceans, Antarctica, and Space (DMAE) of the Ministry of 
External Relations (MRE), met with Science Counselor and Science 
Officer to discuss the options for the renewal of the U.S.-Brazil 
Framework Agreement on Cooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Outer 
Space, which is due to expire on January 31, 2010.  (REFTELS)  Given 
that it is highly unlikely that the USG and [GOB] could conclude 
negotiations of a new framework agreement beforehand, Pitaluga was 
looking at options for extending the existing agreement. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) During the meeting, three options were discussed, all of 
which involve an agreement by exchange of diplomatic notes:  (1) to 
extend the agreement by one additional year; (2) to extend the 
agreement by two years; and (3) to extend the agreement by one year 
and provide for automatic annual extensions of one year unless 
either party objects. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Pitaluga showed a preference for the two latter options 
because they would avoid the necessity of going through this 
extension process each year.  He was interested in the USG view on 
these options.  COMMENT.  Post would appreciate Washington's views 
on these three options.  It would be helpful to pass any concerns to 
the MRE soonest before they start heading in a direction we have 
doubts about.  We expect that the MRE will start the extension 
process in the near future because of the long lead time the MRE 
usually takes to make a decision and approve sending a diplomatic 
note in this matter.  END COMMENT.
