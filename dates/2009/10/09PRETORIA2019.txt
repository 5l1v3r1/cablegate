BROKER CLIVE DIGNON -- CASE K-2626 
 
REF: STATE 100104 
 
¶1. Please see guidance request at Paragraph Five. 
 
¶2. Deputy Political Counselor visited the entity discussed in 
reftel, Dynamic Instrumentation Company, and met with  owner 
Clive Dignon on October 2.  Post confirms that the company is 
in business at the location listed in reftel, 8 Methwold 
Road, Saxonwold, Johannesburg.  Dignon acknowledged that his 
company sells infrared cameras of U.S. origin. Dignon and his 
wife bought the company in 2004 and now employ a staff of 
seven people to market high-end technical equipment to major 
companies in South Africa. 
 
¶3. Dignon lists among his customers South Africa's national 
electricity company ESKOM, as well as major corporate 
customers, including Coca Cola and Netcare Hospital.  Dignon 
told us he worked with the Commercial Attache's office to 
develop the leads that have enabled him to market U.S.-origin 
infrared cameras in South Africa.  Dignon's displays his 
company's business license on his office wall. 
 
¶4. Asked whether Dynamic Instrumentation marketed U.S.-origin 
equipment outside of South Africa, Dignon said that his 
company markets equipment on a limited basis to companies in 
Mozambique, but that his customers for the U.S.-made cameras 
are all South African.  Dignon indicated that he is aware of 
U.S. Munitions List restrictions, including the prohibition 
against unauthorized re-transfers and re-exports. 
 
¶5. Guidance request:  Regarding the issuance of the broker's 
license, Dignon asked us why the U.S. license is dated as 
issued on April 24, 2009 (to expire at the end of March 2010) 
when his payment for the license was not processed until July 
¶2009. Dignon provided POLOFF copies of correspondence between 
Dynamic instrumentation and PM/DTC indicating that the 
company's bank draft for the license was received on August 
8, 2009.  Dignon asked us to check on whether the expiration 
date of the license could be amended, noting that the license 
itself is rather expensive at US$1,000.  Copies of the 
documents Dignon gave us are being e-mailed to PM/DTC and 
PM/DTCC.  Please advise whether the expiration date can be 
amended to reflect when the license was actually issued to 
the company.
