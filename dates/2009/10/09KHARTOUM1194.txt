SUBJECT: SOUTHERN SUDAN REACTION TO NEW USG STRATEGY ON SUDAN 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary: In the aftermath of the new U.S. policy on Sudan 
rollout, the reaction of the Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) and 
other missions in Juba has been very positive.  The local daily 
newspaper, The Citizen, printed the entirety of the strategy on 
October 20, but on October 21 printed an editorial raising some 
concern over the possibility of sanctions being lifted. On October 
21, U.S. Consulate Juba convoked the diplomatic missions in Juba to 
brief them on the policy.  Reactions were generally positive, and 
missions called on the U.S. to continue the dialogue with the 
international community.  End Summary.

GOSS Reacts Positively 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On October 20, the GoSS Ministry of Regional Cooperation 
briefed the diplomatic community on Comprehensive Peace Agreement 
(CPA) implementation, security situation in the south and GOSS 
reaction to the new U.S. policy to Sudan (septel on other items). 
In an October 20th briefing to the diplomatic community, the 
Minister of Regional Cooperation, Oyai Deng Ajak along with Minister 
of Internal Affairs Gier Choung Aluong and Minister of Presidential 
Affairs Luka Biong praised the new U.S. policy on Sudan.  Biong 
explained that the just announced USG strategy would positively 
influence the National Congress Party (NCP) to ensure implementation 
of the CPA, including free and fair elections in April 2010. 
Biong called on all diplomatic missions present to support the USG 
strategy to ensure its success.  He also stated that GOSS President 
Salva Kiir would be issuing a statement in the coming days in 
support of the strategy.  Privately Biong called the strategy a 
"masterpiece."

Press More Guarded

¶3. (U) The Citizen, a local daily newspaper, printed the entire 
media note issued in conjunction with the strategy, "Sudan: A 
Critical Moment, A Comprehensive Approach," on October 20.  The 
daily also ran two editorials on the media note, the first on 
October 20 covering the official Government of National Unity (GNU) 
response playing-down sanctions and arguing against the use of the 
word "genocide" to describe the situation in Darfur.  The second 
editorial on October 21 focused on the failure of the strategy to 
outline specific incentives that will be extended to the NCP, and 
how sanctions will be strengthened if they fail to comply with CPA 
implementation.  The editorial stated that if the U.S. really wanted 
the NCP to comply, it needed to engage the UN Security Council and 
extend sanctions to the international level, binding Arab and 
African states, as well as China.

Consul General Briefing 
----------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) On October 21 the Consul General briefed members of the 
diplomatic community on the new U.S. policy.  The briefing focused 
primarily on the elements related to Southern Sudan and CPA 
implementation.  CG Rogers explained that the new U.S. policy helps 
elevate the CPA, calling for an integrated approach; outlines a new 
more urgent timeline for implementation; and calls for greater rigor 
in meeting benchmarks and progress on the ground. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The UN Deputy Resident Coordinator praised the strategy 
and highlighted the need for greater coordination on security sector 
programs.  UK Head of Delegation Vinay Talwar asked for more clarity 
on how sanctions would be used on Sudan.  The Ugandan Ambassador 
stressed the importance of involving the Inter-Governmental 
Authority on Development (IGAD), and stated that IGAD must live-up 
to its obligations to ensure full-implementation of the CPA.  The 
Eritrean Ambassador noted the continuing fragmentation of the Darfur 
rebel groups, and asked how the USG plans to "pressure them." Other 
representatives called on the U.S. to continue to lead this 
dialogue, particularly in regard to elections/referendum 
coordination and security sector reform. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The CG explained that the full list of incentives  and 
disincentives was classified; however, sanctions were one tool that 
remained in the toolkit.  She concurred with the need to coordinate 
closely with IGAD and noted Special Envoy Gration's on-going efforts 
in that regard.
