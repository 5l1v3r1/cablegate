SUBJECT: JERUSALEM MEDIA REACTION (10/26): More clashes between 
Palestinians and Israeli police at Al Aqsa Mosque 
 
------------- 
Main Stories: 
------------- 
The dailies prominently report on yesterday's confrontations at Al 
Aqsa Mosque between Palestinians and the Israeli police. Reports 
note that the Israeli police and soldiers entered the mosque in the 
morning and closed all entrances to prevent Muslims from entering to 
pray, and cut the electricity so that the mosque could not issue the 
call to prayer. More than 20 Palestinians were injured and 20 people 
were arrested, including the former Palestinian Authority (PA) 
Minister of Jerusalem Affairs Hatem Abdel Qader. Among the injured 
were photographers and reporters of local news agencies. The PA 
Presidency spokesperson Nabil Abu Rudeina condemned the Israeli 
incursions and warned Israel of escalating the situation. According 
to the reports, the Israeli police left the mosque after Egypt and 
Jordan intervened. 
 
Head of the Hamas Political Bureau Khaled Mishal's October 25 speech 
receives front page coverage in the three dailies. Mishal reiterated 
that Hamas is in favor of achieving national reconciliation and 
urged all parties to carefully study the Egyptian plan before 
blaming Hamas for not signing it. Additionally, Mishal condemned PA 
President Mahmoud Abbas's decision to hold presidential and 
legislative elections on January 24, 2010 describing the act as 
"illegal and illegitimate." He noted that this decision will only 
deepen the state of division. 
 
Hamas newspaper Al-Resala reports that Israeli Defense Minister Ehud 
Barak announced that he will not form a special committee to 
investigate Israeli soldiers' behaviors during the recent conflict 
in Gaza. 
 
Gaza-based Al-Quds radio reports that Egypt heavily criticized Hamas 
for its position on national reconciliation and accused them of 
obstructing efforts. The report notes that the Arab League will 
convene to discuss the implications of Hamas's position. 
 
Weekend Stories: 
 
Sunday October 25: 
 
All three dailies lead with comments by President Abbas on Saturday 
reiterating his insistence on achieving national unity, but noting 
that elections must be held on time "because the elections are a 
legal and constitutional obligation." Abbas added, "as we continue 
to fulfil our constitutional obligation, we will continue with 
reconciliation efforts, political work, and negotiations. We will 
move forward and take all matters very seriously." 
 
Al Quds runs a front page story quoting unnamed senior Palestinian 
sources stating that Egyptian officials are angry with Hamas because 
of its refusal to sign the national reconciliation agreement. The 
sources added that Cairo is aware that the Hamas leadership is 
subject to pressure by other countries to obstruct the 
reconciliation efforts in order to negatively impact Egypt's role in 
the region. An Egyptian official announced that Cairo will not 
ignore comments made by the different factions on the Egyptian plan 
for national reconciliation, but will take them into consideration 
upon implementation of the agreement, once it is approved. The 
source revealed that contacts are taking place between Egypt and 
Hamas to clarify some of Hamas's concerns. 
 
Al Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida run front page stories on Israeli

police forces increasing their presence around Al Aqsa Mosque. The 
Israel police said it will deploy large forces around Al Aqsa Mosque 
and in Jerusalem neighbourhoods following calls for Palestinians to 
protect the mosque against the Israeli occupation. The police said 
it will respond firmly to any attempt to disrupt public order. 
Meanwhile, Hatem Abdel Qader told Al Quds newspaper that extremist 
Jewish groups broadcasted called on their followers to enter Al Aqsa 
Mosque today and perform religious rituals. Abdel Qader added that 
the Israeli police should learn from the events that took place 
earlier this month and stressed that allowing extremists to enter 
will create an explosive situation for which Israel will be held 
responsible. 
 
Saturday, October 24 
 
All three dailies run front page stories on Palestinian Authority 
President Mahmoud Abbas issuing a decree on Friday calling for 
presidential and legislative elections on January 24, 2010. In an 
official statement, Fatah said this is a constitutional obligation, 
while Hamas rejected the decree and said that it constitutes a harsh 
blow to reconciliation efforts. Nabil Abu Rudeineh, the Spokesperson 
for the Office of the President, told Al Ayyam that President Abbas 
agreed to the reconciliation agreement proposed by Egypt which 
called for the elections on June 28, 2010, but Hamas did not accept 
the Egyptian proposal. Therefore, Abu Rudeineh added, "since Hamas 
did not accept the proposed agreement, President Abbas is complying 
with the legal procedures stipulated by the Basic Law and has thus 
signed the decree to conduct the elections on its constitutional 
date." One Hamas official threatened to conduct elections separately 
in Gaza on the same day. 
 
The dailies also run front page stories on President Obama's phone 
call to President Abbas on Friday during which they discussed issues 
related to the peace process. President Obama reiterated his 
personal commitment to the establishment of a Palestinian state, 
while President Abbas reiterated his commitment to a peace process 
that has clear terms of reference that would lead to the 
establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Nabil Abu 
Rudeineh said that "the call was very important for the future of 
the peace process and for the region as a whole." 
 
Al Quds carries front page news that the Municipality of Jerusalem 
will start implementing demolition orders for at least 59 buildings 
in East Jerusalem, including 42 houses. Ahmad Rwaidy, head of the 
Jerusalem Unit at the Office of the Palestinian President, said that 
this is like a declaration of war on the Palestinian presence in 
occupied Jerusalem. Rwaidy warned that this step will add fuel to an 
already inflamed situation. Rwaidy also said that the Jerusalem 
municipality and Ministry of Interior have distributed demolition 
orders for 150 houses in Jerusalem over the past few days, 
particularly in the Silwan and Al-Bustan neighbourhoods. Rwaidy 
stressed that these measures are part of a policy of ethnic 
cleansing to force Palestinians out of Jerusalem.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
------------- 
 
1) Al-Quds independent daily runs an editorial under the title "Your 
Statements Will Not Rescue Al-Aqsa" (10/26): "It is shameful that 
the Palestinian Authority and its bodies do not have anything except 
condemnation for the Israeli attacks against Muslims and the holy 
sites. To all Arab leaders, your condemnation will not do us any 
good ... we need serious measures."

2) Talal Okal opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the title 
"A Little Sense of Responsibility"(10/26): "The Palestinian 
President is obliged to issue the decree for holding the elections 
on time, he has no other choice ... If the president did not issue 
such a decree, Palestine will suffer from constitutional vacuum that 
no one will accept."
