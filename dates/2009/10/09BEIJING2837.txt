¶1.  OBAMA'S VISIT TO CHINA 
 
"Obama will visit China for four days during his eight-day trip to 
Asia" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(10/09)(pg 16): "According to a Global Times 
poll on October 8, Chinese netizens are not very enthusiastic about 
Obama's visit to China.  Only 14% of netizens are looking forward to 
the visit, and 50% of netizens worry that Obama will pressure China 
to appreciate the RMB.  Yu Wanli at Peking University's 
International Relations Research Center said that Obama's visit 
shows that the U.S. is seeking a balanced strategy between Japan and 
China in East Asia.  U.S. diplomacy in the region is focused on 
maintaining a closer relationship to East Asian countries than those 
countries have with each other.  Obama's planned stay in China - the 
longest on his trip to the region - shows the United States' 
emphasis on China.  Jin Canrong at the People's University of China 
said that China has set expectations for the visit on issues like 
trade and economic policy, human rights, and Taiwan, and looks 
forward to more respect for China from the U.S.  Given the 
intensification of the Tibet issue, it is necessary for Obama to 
mention once again that Tibet is an inseparable part of China on his 
visit." 
 
¶2.  NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY 
 
"Be wary of the infiltration of the National Endowment for 
Democracy" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(10/09)(pg 14): "It would be wrong to believe 
that, while it is convenient to accept money from the U.S. National 
Endowment for Democracy (NED) to make up for the shortage of funds 
for scientific research, researchers would not have to share their 
research results with NED.  In fact, NED cares primarily about what 
research Chinese intellectuals are focusing on and how it can get 
them to focus on research the U.S. is interested in.  In this way, 
the U.S. will be more certain about the future direction of China. 
NED's infiltration into China is like a 'mild cultural war': a 
dedicated long-term project to reconstruct thinking and ideology in 
China.  China should be vigilant about the far-reaching influence 
and negative results.  NED has also sponsored social movements and 
encouraged political confrontations as another form of 'mild war.' 
The influence of NED was behind the 3.14 (March 14) incident in 
Tibet and the 7.5 (July 5) incident in Xinjiang." 
 
¶3.  U.S.-CHINA TRADE RELATIONS 
 
"Obama is a bit chaotic" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(10/09)(pg 15): "Obama has done a number of 
things that he should not have done, and, conversely, not done a 
number of things he should have done.  For example, he has caved in 
to Wall Street pressure; continued U.S. military operations; and 
adopted hostile trade policies towards China.  China really wants to 
be the U.S.'s 'strategic partner,' but it has not been well 
rewarded: China was the first country that Obama imposed sanctions 
on.  Obama's speech to American students came across as 
hypocritical.  Obama has continued Bush's policy of giving money to 
financial profiteers on Wall Street regardless of the costs or 
consequences.  The huge deficits that will have to be paid off by 
successive generations will affect the American students of today. 
Maybe Obama already had problems before he was elected which were 
intentionally covered up by the media during the presidential 
election.  For example, Obama smokes, and, what is even worse, he 
does not try to quit.  It is not accidental that Obama has become a 
bit chaotic now."
