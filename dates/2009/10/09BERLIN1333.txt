¶1.  (SBU) Post delivered reftel demarche to 
representatives of Germany's Ministry of Agriculture, the 
Ministry of Economics and Technology and the Foreign 
Office. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The head of the AgMin's International Trade 
Policy Division, Klaus Kehrein, told FAS that extending 
Geographical Indications (GI) protection to wines and 
spirits under the TRIPS Agreement is not a priority for 
Germany.  Kehrein said that Germany does support GIs 
specifically for wine, but he candidly stated that 
extending GI protection to other products and creating a 
legally binding registry is mainly being pushed by 
southern EU Mediterranean countries (i.e., Italy, Spain, 
Portugal and France).  Kehrein further stated that, since 
Germany is an EU member, it will likely support the 
European Commission's proposal out of solidarity. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Christina Decker of the External Economic 
Policy Section in the Econ Ministry said that it is no 
secret that Germany is not a strong supporter of 
extending Geographical Indications (GI) protection. 
Decker stated that the Econ Ministry understands the U.S. 
concerns with extending GIs, but this is an issue that is 
very important for some EU member countries (i.e., the 
countries mentioned above), and ultimately all EU member 
countries have to agree on a common position in trade 
matters.  Decker also acknowledged that giving more 
leeway to developing countries, such as Brazil and India, 
on patent protection is not in the interest of German 
industry, but this was purely a political move to gain 
their support for the GIs proposal. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Comment: Germany could become a potential U.S. 
ally within the EU on this issue. It is unclear, however, 
whether Germany is willing to invest political capital. 
Embassy has scheduled several meetings at a more senior 
level to encourage support from Germany and will report 
evolution of German views.  End Comment.
