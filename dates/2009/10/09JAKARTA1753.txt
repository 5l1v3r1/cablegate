SUBJECT:  INDONESIA EARTHQUAKE HUMANITARIAN UPDATE #10:  FOOD 
SECURITY AND AGRICULTURE NEEDS NOT CRITICAL AT PRESENT BUT MAY 
INCREASE 
 
------- 
Summary 
------- 
 
¶1.  The USAID Disaster Assistance Response Team (USAID/DART) has 
assessed food security and agriculture conditions in 
earthquake-affected Agam, Pariaman, and Padang Pariaman districts. 
The earthquake resulted in the loss of many families' rice stocks 
and damaged irritation infrastructure considerably in some areas. 
However, the quake did not significantly disrupt the current 
agricultural season.  At present, charitable giving, emergency food 
assistance, and market purchases are meeting families' immediate 
needs for short-term food assistance.  While food is not currently a 
critical issue, without sufficient assistance through the next 
harvest season, household-level food insecurity of affected 
populations may significantly increase.  The USAID/DART will 
continue to monitor food security and agricultural conditions of 
earthquake-affected populations.  End summary.

Food Security and Agriculture Needs Assessment 
--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶2.  Since arriving in Padang, the USAID/DART field officer has 
assessed food security and agriculture in 13 villages in Agam, 
Pariaman, and Padang Pariaman districts.  Through meetings with 
Government of Indonesia (GoI) representatives, interviews with 
earthquake-affected families, and assessments of irrigation 
infrastructure, the USAID/DART has obtained a clearer picture of 
current food security and agriculture conditions.  Most affected 
families interviewed by the USAID/DART ranked obtaining food -- 
specifically rice -- as their first or second priority at present. 
 
-- Food Stocks Lost -- 
 
¶3.  The September 30 earthquake in West Sumatra did not interrupt 
the primary rice planting or harvest seasons.  Where fields remain 
undamaged and where water irrigation systems are still operable, the 
rice crop should be ready to harvest in three to four months. 
Because the agricultural cycle has not been interrupted, long-term 
food distributions are not needed. 
 
¶4.  The most recent rice harvest occurred in mid-August, just prior 
to Ramadan.  Families reported storing harvested rice in their 
houses for consumption until the next harvest, expected in January 
and February.  Most families reported growing enough rice to sustain 
the family until the next harvest without having to rely on market 
purchase. 
 
¶5.  However, the recent earthquake damaged many homes and, in the 
process, caused a significant number of families to lose their rice 
stocks for the coming three months.  The loss of household stocks 
has forced many families to rely on market purchases to make up for 
the shortfall of rice.  Rice traders interviewed by the USAID/DART 
field officer reported that the increase in demand across the 
earthquake-affected region for rice purchase has led to an increase 
in price.  Market assessments indicate that, on average, the cost of 
rice has increased by 30 percent since prior to the earthquake.  The 
increase in the price of rice combined with families' reliance on 
market purchase creates the potential for increasing household-level 
food insecurity by limiting families' access to food. 
 
-- Damage to Infrastructure -- 
 
¶6.  According to the USAID/DART field officer, the earthquake caused 
considerable damage to irrigation canals in pockets of areas.  The 
damage was due to landslides that directly damaged irrigation 
infrastructure or that blocked rivers, re-directing water away from 
irrigation systems. 
 
¶7.  Irrigation systems need to be restored before agricultural

production of rice can continue without interruption.  However, the 
next rice-growing season relies on rainfall and is not dependent on 
irrigation systems being intact for crops to grow.  The USAID/DART 
is making inquiries with partners to gauge interest in addressing 
the irrigation canal issue.  The USAID/DART will continue to monitor 
the situation. 
 
-- Addressing Needs through Social Capital -- 
 
¶8.  The USAID/DART field officer has noted the high social capital 
of the area, as many donations of food from unaffected communities 
throughout Indonesia continue to be delivered to needy families. 
One family remarked that they lacked food but were not worried 
because food arrives every day from better-off communities.  The 
potential duration of these community-help efforts is not clear.  In 
some areas, these charitable distributions are meeting an immediate 
need for food, thereby allowing families to spend money on other 
items needed for recovery. 
 
-- Addressing Needs through Emergency Food Assistance -- 
 
¶9.  The U.N. World Food Program (WFP) and the GoI are coordinating 
food distributions.  Currently, WFP is distributing noodles and 
biscuits, while the GoI is distributing cash and rice for one 
month's requirement.  The GoI program distributes $70 per 
earthquake-affected family to cover food needs for one month, using 
a five-member per household average.  WFP has redirected noodles and 
biscuits from the Aceh program and has appealed for funding through 
the Humanitarian Response Plan to continue this program for three 
months.  (Comment:  The USAID/DART has already observed upward 
pressure on rice prices as families that do not normally purchase 
rice begin to do so.  In some places, food distributions will need 
to continue until the next rice harvest occurs, especially for 
poorer households.  Whether the GoI program will continue past the 
one-month ration, thereby raising additional household-level food 
security concerns by sustaining upward pressure on rice prices, is 
unclear.  End comment.) 
 
-------------------------------------- 
USAID/DART Activities to Monitor Needs 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶10.  While food is not currently a critical issue, without 
sufficient assistance through the next harvest season, 
household-level food insecurity of affected populations may 
significantly increase.  Through late November, the USAID/DART will 
maintain two field officers in Padang who will continue to monitor 
this situation.
