SUBJECT: IRAQ'S ECONOMY ON THE EVE OF THE ELECTION: ARE YOU 
BETTER OFF NOW THAN FOUR YEARS AGO? 
 
REF: A. BAGHDAD 2301 
     ¶B. BAGHDAD 2514 
 
This cable is sensitive but unclassified; please protect 
accordingly. 
 
¶1. (SBU) On the eve of the election season in Iraq, we do not 
expect any major party or coalition to campaign on a record 
of economic success.  Security and stability continue to be 
the primary focus, and are essential for economic success. 
However, it is worthwhile to compare today,s Iraqi economy 
with the economy that existed before the formation of Iraq's 
first democratically elected government in May 2006. 
 
¶2. (SBU) From a strictly economic point view, looking at the 
macroeconomic figures below, an average Iraqi might answer 
"yes"to the question: "Are you better off now than you were 
four years ago?"  A general improvement in the security 
situation has contributed to a fall in inflation (ref A). 
Private bank lending has surpassed private bank capital (ref 
B), meaning more Iraqi consumers and businesses are able to 
borrow to achieve their goals.  The benefits of technology 
are spreading as power generation is improving and cell phone 
and internet usage is growing.  Finally, total trade and 
imports grew considerably, reflecting that more foreign goods 
are in the market than four years ago.  (NOTE: August 2009 is 
the most recent point for which we have corresponding data. 
Projected data are noted with a (P). END NOTE.)
