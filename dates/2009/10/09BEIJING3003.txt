  Editorial Quotes

¶1.  SECRETARY CLINTON IN PAKISTAN 
 
"Secretary Clinton acts as 'director' at speech in Pakistan" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(10/30)(pg 2): "Secretary Clinton's visit 
sparked a wave of 'Hillary fever' (positive connotation) in 
Pakistan.  She gave a 20-minute speech at a Pakistani university and 
spent 40 minutes answering students' questions.  At her direction, 
students left their seats and quickly lined up to ask questions. 
When she answered their questions, she was eloquent, logical, wise 
and funny, and her answers received applause.  When asked about the 
differences between President Obama's policy on Pakistan and 
President Bush's, Secretary Clinton said that she firmly opposed 
Bush's policy, but believes Obama understands Pakistan's 
difficulties.  When talking about U.S.-Pakistan relations, she said 
that the U.S. government is dedicated to maintaining a long-term 
relationship with Pakistan to deal with issues affecting both 
countries' interests.  She also pointed out that both the U.S. and 
Pakistan have had negative views of each other at times, but that 
her visit is meant to demonstrate the U.S.'s good will towards 
Pakistan.  Pakistan is a geopolitically important country and has 
become the largest recipient of U.S. assistance." 
 
¶2.  TAIWAN 
 
"The U.S. is conning money out of Taiwan through arms sales" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(10/30)(pg 4): "Arms sales to Taiwan have always 
been a method used by the U.S. to curb mainland China.  The U.S. 
will make substantial profits from the sale of a long-distance early 
warning radar system to Taiwan.  With this system, the U.S. can also 
collect information on mainland China.  Experts said that when it 
comes to arms sales to Taiwan, the U.S. only cares about its own 
strategic and economic interests.  Thus, Taiwan should seek common 
ground with mainland China instead of putting too much hope in U.S. 
arms." 
 
¶3.  U.S. MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM 
 
"Retreat in order to advance" 
 
The official Communist Party People's Daily (Renmin Ribao)(10/30)(pg 
3): "Obama announced recently that he would halt missile defense 
plans in the Czech Republic and Poland.  This move is actually 'a 
retreat in order to advance.'  The U.S. has incorporated missile 
defense into its national strategy based on its assessment of the 
security threats it faces in the 21st century.  This strategy will 
not easily change with a new administration, the financial crisis, 
or opposition from other countries.  In addition, research on a 
missile defense system has contributed to technological advances 
that strengthen the U.S. in many fields.  In this way, the U.S. can 
maintain its military and technological advantages.  In fact, the 
new U.S. missile defense plan is an 'upgraded' version of the old 
plan and is more practical, more flexible and more powerful.  In 
this new plan, it is worth watching out for sea-based missile 
defense systems.  Such mobile missile defense systems do not occupy 
a particular area of land and can therefore avoid complicated legal 
troubles in other countries."
