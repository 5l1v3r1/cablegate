¶1.  (U) Sensitive but unclassified.  Not for public Internet. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  On October 14, Talgat Kaliyev, head of the 
Kazakhstani Ministry of Foreign Affairs' new policy planning staff, 
told the DCM that with FM Saudabayev's endorsement, he is exploring 
plans to establish a bureau within the Foreign Ministry to 
coordinate Kazakhstan's planned $50 million in assistance to 
Afghanistan.  If successful, this Agency could eventually become 
Kazakhstan's variant of the Agency for International Development, 
primarily focused on South and Central Asia.  Kaliyev asked for U.S. 
government "recommendations, advice, and vision" on the concept, and 
stated his plan to travel to Washington for consultations.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Talgat Kaliyev, head of the Foreign Ministry's new policy 
planning staff, briefed the DCM on his plan to develop an agency to 
coordinate government-wide assistance to Afghanistan on October 14. 
In his new job for just three weeks, Kaliyev, echoing both President 
Nazarbayev and FM Saudabayev, called Afghanistan one of the most 
urgent issues.  In the Kazakhstani government, many Ministries are 
involved in this arena, but they lack coordination, he said. 
Kaliyev stated his perception based on two years in Astana that "If 
you want to do something, you must do it yourself with the shortest 
chain of command.  Otherwise, it takes a very long time." 
Therefore, with the Foreign Minister's support, he is proposing the 
creation of a unit within the Kazakhstani Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, with the working title "Kazakh-Afghan Bureau of 
Assistance."  This bureau would primarily focus on civilian aid in 
fields such as education, health, agriculture, and construction, and 
ensure "proper use" of Kazakhstan's $50 million commitment to 
Afghanistan. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) To establish the agency in the near future, Kaliyev plans 
to work with Kazakhstan's Ambassador-at-Large to the Shanghai 
Cooperation Organization, Shakrat Nurushev.  Once Nurushev returns 
from his trip to Beijing, Kaliev hopes to send a proposal to the 
Prime Minister's office with a draft decree that would establish the 
bureau.  At the same time, he proposes to recruit seven staffers 
with regional experience, primarily from the Foreign Ministry.  The 
bureau's first task would be to collect information from every 
Ministry and relevant Embassies.  It would then share this 
information with the United States and ask for feedback.  Based on 
these needs, it would seek information from companies.  Finally, the 
agency would direct assistance "without the bureaucracy.  It will be 
the American way of making business," he concluded proudly. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Kaliyev said that once the proposal is completed, he hopes 
it will be implemented by a decree of the prime minister.  He 
requested U.S. support for the proposal when it becomes official. 
In order to establish relations and gain "recommendations, advice, 
and vision" on the concept, Kaliyev plans to travel to Washington. 
He promised to share a concept paper with the Embassy once he 
develops one.  In the long term, Kaliyev hopes that President Obama 
might send a letter of appreciation for the agency.  Kaliyev also 
shared his aspiration that the agency could become in a few years 
Kazakhstan's Agency for International Development focused primarily 
on South and Central Asia. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) In response to questions about Kazakhstan's current plan 
to bring to Kazakhstan thousands of Afghani undergraduate students, 
Kaliyev stated that the program remains a priority.  However, there 
has been a delay in signing the agreement, which Kaliyev speculated 
may have resulted from language questions.  Still, Kaliev affirmed 
the Ministry of Education's strong commitment, and the Minister's 
plans to travel to Kabul, possibly in December. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) COMMENT:  The policy planning function is a new one in the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  Kaliyev, formerly Political Counselor 
in Washington when FM Saudabayev was ambassador, is looking for 
concrete ways to advance initiatives of the president and foreign 
minister, including a larger role for Kazakhstan in Afghanistan. 
The bureau is not a fully formed idea, but Kaliyev may be attempting 
to influence both domestic and international politics with this 
ambitious proposal.  Inside the government, this plan would give the 
 
ASTANA 00001856  002.2 OF 002 
 
 
Foreign Ministry significant power over diffuse assistance efforts. 
At the same time, it would allow the Foreign Ministry to better 
extend its reach internationally, by ensuring that Kazakhstan's 
efforts are known throughout the world, and potentially earning it a 
seat at the international donors' table.  Kaliyev is reaching out in 
the early planning stage, which could present us a useful 
opportunity to participate in another phase of Kazakhstan's 
development as a strategic partner.  About a decade ago, U.S. 
consultation and technical assistance helped to establish 
Kazakhstan's now well-functioning Security Council, modeled on 
Washington's National Security Council.  END COMMENT.
