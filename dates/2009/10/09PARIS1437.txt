¶1.  (SBU)  Econ Counselor and Poloff delivered the demarche in ref A 
to Annie Evrard, Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) desk officer for 
Pakistan, and Guillaume Cruse, an official from the Agence France de 
Development.  Both are members of the interagency 
Afghanistan-Pakistan "cell" and familiar with French assistance 
programs to Pakistan.  Emboffs stressed the importance that the 
Secretary of State attaches personally to financial support for 
Pakistan and noted that the Ambassador had raised the same points 
with Diplomatic Counselor to President Sarkozy,, Jean-David Levitte, 
on October 21. 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Evrard said that France has offered no direct budgetary 
support to Pakistan, only concessionary loans.  Cruse said France has 
increased its concessionary loan commitments to Pakistan since the 
April Tokyo conference to 382 million euros (573 million dollars). 
The loans cover nine projects in the areas of hydroelectricity and 
energy efficiency.  Some of these projects are co-financed by Germany 
and the Asian Development Bank.  Cruse said these were the projects 
covered by France's pledges at the Tokyo conference, adding that they 
now well exceed the 200 million euros ($299 million) promised, and 
offered to provide Embassy with additional  details about  these 
loans.  (Note:  Embassy will forward any further information we 
receive to SRAP.  End note.)  Cruse added that France is still also 
dispensing funds made under soft loans worth 11 million euros for 
post-earthquake reconstruction.  Evrard said France is not yet ready 
to contribute to the World Bank-administered multi-donor trust fund 
for Pakistan as it was not clear who their partners on the Pakistani 
side would be and what safeguards there would be over the funds.
