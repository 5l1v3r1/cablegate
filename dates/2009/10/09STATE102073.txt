SUBJECT: MULTILATERAL "COUNTERING VIOLENT EXTREMISM 
(CVE)" WORKSHOP, NOVEMBER 4-6, 2009 
 
¶1. Action Request - See Para 9. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The Secretary's Ambassador-at-Large for 
Counterterrorism is pleased to announce a three-day 
"Multinational Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) 
Planners Workshop" from Wednesday, November 4-Friday, 
November 6, 2009 in Washington, D.C.   This workshop 
will focus on: 
 
-- coordinating current efforts to counter violent 
extremism with Allies; 
-- discussing a common approach and developing a 
multinational framework for  a CVE Common Operating 
Picture; 
-- facilitating the establishment of a multinational CVE 
network; 
-- developing a multinational CVE Capacity Assessment 
and Building methodology; 
-- identifying collaboration opportunities and best 
practices; and 
-- validating objectives for related regional workshops. 
 
¶3. The workshop will be hosted at the George C. Marshall 
Conference Center at the Harry S. Truman Building (Main 
State).   S/CT invites representatives from the 
following countries to participate: Australia, Canada, 
Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Spain, 
and The United Kingdom. 
 
Program Overview 
 
¶4. (SBU) S/CT will host a series of CVE Collaborative 
Workshops to bring together senior counterterrorism 
officials and CVE practitioners and planners from 
partner nations to focus on the topics listed in 
paragraph one.  Phase I of this series will take place 
from November 4-6 and will include participants from 
Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The 
Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom.  This 
workshop will be followed by a series of regionally- 
focused workshops; the first will be held February 8-12, 
2010, and will focus on South and Central Asia.  The 
February workshop will include representatives from 
Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri 
Lanka, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. 
 
¶5. (SBU) Key workshop objectives are to: 
-discuss varying frameworks and methodologies for 
Countering Violent Extremism and discuss a common 
strategic approach for multinational efforts 
-discuss and share CVE best practices; identify areas 
of potential collaboration 
-develop a multinational CVE capacity building model 
and assessment methodology to allow application in 
participating countries 
-develop a multinational CVE Common Operating Picture; 
discuss and identify a CVE information sharing 
platform 
 
¶6. (SBU) Expected Outcomes: The workshops are expected 
to facilitate an exchange of information and enhance 
awareness of multinational and partner nation efforts to 
counter violent extremism, as well as identify and 
assess gaps in these efforts and to enable further and 
sustained effort through a networking of practitioners 
and resources.  This effort will ultimately result in a 
more coordinated, effective, and sustained effort to 
counter violent extremism on a regional and global 
basis.  The fostering of greater bilateral and regional 
cooperation with the U.S. and partner governments, and 
facilitating further capabilities and actions may be the 
most important outcomes. 
 
¶7. (SBU) Participants: Participants should be 
practitioners at the Director level who are actively 
engaged in CVE planning and coordination (either 
domestically or internationally) within their respective 
governments.  The workshop will be conducted entirely in 
English; therefore, language ability may be a 
consideration in selecting participants. 
 
¶8. (U) Funding: Unfortunately, S/CT does not have 
funding for participant travel or accommodations for 
this conference. 
 
¶9. (SBU)  Action Request: Drawing on language in Paras 2 
and 5 above, Posts are requested to approach host 
governments and encourage participation in the November 
4-6 workshop.  Participants should be identified prior 
to 20 October.   Prospective participants' names,
