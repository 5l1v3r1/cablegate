Classified By: Ambassador Kristie A. Kenney, reasons 1.4 (b) and (d). 
 
¶1. (C) SUMMARY: Chairman Murad Ebrahim of the separatist 
group Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) welcomed the 
Charge d'Affaires October 16 to MILF headquarters in Mindanao 
to discuss recent progress in informal peace talks with the 
Philippine government and to express thanks for U.S. 
development assistance and humanitarian relief programs.  In 
a 90-minute meeting attended by top MILF Central Committee 
members and MILF armed forces commanders, Chairman Murad 
encouraged the U.S. to move beyond its substantial 
development assistance to provide more political support to 
the peace process.  While stopping short of issuing a formal 
invitation for the U.S. to join the International Contact 
Group (Ref A) in support of peace talks, he nonetheless 
labeled the U.S. as the "only country" that could help solve 
the MILF's decades-long conflict with the Philippine 
government.  The Charge reiterated U.S. support for a 
peaceful solution to the conflict.  The Charge also reminded 
Chairman Murad of the need for the MILF to take action 
against terrorism in Mindanao and urged him to support 
efforts to rescue a recently kidnapped Irish Catholic priest. 
 END SUMMARY. 
 
CHARGE MEETS MILF CHAIRMAN 
-------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) On October 16, the Charge traveled to Maguindanao 
Province, Mindanao, to meet with Moro Islamic Liberation 
Front (MILF) Chairman Murad Ebrahim.  An honor guard greeted 
the Charge and other delegation members on their arrival at 
the MILF leadership's heavily guarded Camp Darapanan, 
accessible from a poorly maintained dirt trail off a main 
road just north of Cotabato City.  Men young and old in 
Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF) camouflage uniforms 
stood at intervals in formation on the two kilometer stretch 
from the main road to the camp's Bangsamoro Development 
Agency office, with guns and rocket launchers at their sides. 
 
 
MILF WORKING TO MOVE PEACE TALKS FORWARD 
---------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) In a cordial tone, MILF Chairman Murad expressed 
gratitude for the U.S. government's support of the peace 
process, embodied in exchanges of letters during the past six 
years with U.S. officials, and called the Americans the 
"friends of the Bangsamoro."  In good spirits and speaking 
English fluently, surrounded by a dozen top MILF members 
(including Peace Panel members and armed forces commanders), 
Chairman Murad said he looked forward to cooperating with the 
U.S. government to achieve peace in the MILF's homeland, but 
noted the MILF still had concerns about the perceived lack of 
political will on the part of the Philippine government, 
given the discouraging August 2008 collapse of peace efforts. 
 Still, the MILF was prepared to "maximize the potential with 
President Arroyo," despite her short time remaining in 
office.  Murad said the parties expected to finalize a 
precursor agreement on Civilian Protection during the next 
round of informal talks the week of October 26 in Kuala 
Lumpur. 
 
CHARGE COMMENDS PROGRESS, REITERATES STANDING POLICY 
 
--------------------------------------------- ------- 
 
¶4. (C) The Charge d'Affaires commended the Chairman on recent 
and anticipated progress in informal peace talks and assured 
him of continued U.S. support for the peace process.  The 
U.S. would stand ready to provide development support as 
talks move forward, the Charge said, and would provide 
additional assistance following a peace agreement.  U.S. 
policy toward the MILF remained consistent with the 
principles expressed in the 2003 letter from former EAP A/S 
Kelly to MILF Chairman Salamat Hashim.  The U.S. welcomes the 
MILF's stated willingness to compromise in their quest for 
peace. 
 
MILF SEEKS LARGER ROLE FOR U.S.

¶5. (C) While extremely appreciative of U.S. development aid 
that "gives hope" to his people, Murad appealed to the Charge 
for the U.S. to play a more public role on the political 
aspects of the peace process.  However, he did not 
specifically extend an invitation for the U.S. to participate 
in a new mechanism to support the peace process, the 
International Contact Group (ICG), whose creation was 
endorsed by both parties as well as by the Malaysian 
government (as facilitator of peace talks) in September.  "We 
look for a more active role of the U.S. in order to push the 
peace process," Murad said, noting that "the U.S. is the only 
country we feel can push peaceful resolution of the conflict. 
 You are aware of the background of the problem.  The 
influence of America in the Philippines (is one that) no 
other country can match."  Because of its "basic principles 
of fairness and justice," the U.S. owed this help to the Moro 
people, Murad said, citing the Moros' historical desire for 
Muslim Mindanao to be incorporated as a U.S. possession. 
Murad emphasized that development aid and political support 
for negotiations -- "peacemaking" -- should always proceed 
together in a mutually reinforcing manner.  In a surprisingly 
frank and revealing comment, Murad expressed concern that 
development assistance alone, absent political advances, 
could "purge the insurgency" of its momentum, further 
demonstrating the need for development and political progress 
to go hand-in-hand. 
 
¶6. (C) Expanding on Murad's remarks, loquacious MILF Peace 
Panel Senior Member Michael Mastura encouraged the U.S. to 
play a more concrete role and to shift its policy away from 
counterterrorism operations toward a policy of "peace" -- a 
possible reference to peace-building activities.  Although he 
understood the framework for U.S. military support to the 
Philippine military in Mindanao under the Visiting Forces 
Agreement (VFA) was counterterrorism, Mastura suggested the 
U.S. should consider a new policy focused on peace-building 
rather than just counterterrorism.  He lamented that U.S. 
forces did not intervene during the year of fighting between 
Philippine military and MILF forces that followed the 
collapse of the territorial agreement in August 2008.  The 
MILF Central Committee, he said, felt that the U.S was 
playing an "ambivalent role" in the peace process, and that 
U.S. support should extend beyond development assistance and 
confidence building measures. 
 
U.S. READY TO LISTEN, BUT CONCERNED ABOUT TERRORISM 
--------------------------------------------- ------ 
 
¶7. (C) The Charge said that the U.S. was prepared to listen 
if the two parties engaged in negotiations had specific 
recommendations on a role for the U.S.  She reminded Murad 
that the U.S. took the MILF's commitment to peaceful 
resolution of the conflict "at face value," to include a 
rejection of terror not just in words, but in deeds, as well. 
 The October 11 kidnapping of Irish national Father Michael 
Sinnott, the Charge said, was a reminder of the need for all 
citizens of Mindanao to have security, and she relayed to 
Murad the extreme concern of the Irish Ambassador regarding 
Father Sinnott's ill health and need for heart medication. 
The MILF had a role to play in helping the situation and 
preventing terrorist and kidnap-for-ransom groups from 
exploiting the lack of security.  Clarifying the role of U.S. 
service members in Mindanao, the Charge emphasized that the 
VFA provided for military cooperation between the U.S. and 
Philippine governments on training and support only; U.S. 
forces were not participating in combat operations or 
operating unilaterally. 
 
¶8. (C) Mastura noted that the MILF had a clear position 
against terrorism and insisted that Indonesia, not the MILF, 
should be the target of U.S. terrorism concerns.  The issue 
of security and counterterrorism was, after all, separate 
from the MILF quest for autonomy, and had more to do with the 
Indonesians who came to Mindanao than with the MILF. 
Moreover, Mastura noted, the MILF was the only rebel group in 
the country to have signed an agreement with the Philippine 
government to pursue terrorist groups, a reference to the 
joint Philippine-MILF policing force. 
 
BANGSAMORO PEOPLE SEEK PEACE AGREEMENT 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (C) Murad said that the 10,000 civilians and military 
members that make up the MILF wanted a political solution to 
 
MANILA 00002198  003 OF 004 
 
 
the problem and placed tremendous importance on a written 
agreement with the Philippine government, which explained 
their disappointment at the Philippine Supreme Court's ruling 
that undermined last year's territorial agreement.  MILF 
Peace Panel Chairman Mohager Iqbal said the MILF did not view 
the derailing of the agreement as the fault of the court, but 
rather the fault of the government's peace panel.  Vice 
Chairman for Political Affairs Ghazali Jafaar cautioned that 
the biggest challenge in crafting a peace agreement would be 
to ensure it would be permanent, just, and acceptable to a 
majority of the Bangsamoro people.  At present, he said, the 
Moro people were unsatisfied, and, as such, were not willing 
to give up their struggle. 
 
ROLE OF DEVELOPMENT 
------------------- 
 
¶10. (C) USAID Acting Mission Director briefly reviewed 
successful U.S. engagement on development projects in 
Mindanao, noting that 60% of U.S. development funds for the 
Philippines are dedicated to Mindanao, with a significant 
portion going to projects in conflict-affected areas. 
Examples of successful U.S. projects in Mindanao included 
emergency assistance to internally displaced persons (IDPs) 
in central Mindanao, democracy, governance, and conflict 
resolution programs, and major infrastructure projects like 
the Jolo airport runway and water systems on Basilan. 
Responding to Mastura's assertion that development assistance 
programs were forcing internally displaced persons to return 
to communities unprepared to accept them, the USAID Director 
explained that U.S. programs supported the humanitarian and 
livelihood needs of IDPs and did not direct their movement 
out of IDP camps to their home communities, which was purely 
a Philippine government decision. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
 
¶11. (C) The MILF sought and received U.S. assurances of 
support for the peace process and witnessed U.S. willingness 
to hear MILF perspectives on the historical roots of the 
conflict.  By inviting such a large internal MILF audience to 
the meeting -- including senior MILF military commanders -- 
Chairman Murad and his peace panel may have been seeking to 
demonstrate to their military wing that the U.S. remains 
focused on counterterrorism and, despite recent media 
coverage to the contrary (Ref B), is not engaged in 
counterinsurgency efforts against the MILF.  Murad may have 
also sought to reinforce to his commanders the notion that a 
peaceful settlement is possible, and that they had continued 
U.S. support for a comprehensive peace agreement.  The MILF 
and Philippine peace panels are expected to review next week 
in Kuala Lumpur their "short lists" of countries they will 
recommend for the ICG.  While it is not clear that either the 
Philippine government or the MILF want us to form part of the 
Contact Group, the MILF was clearly eager for an active U.S. 
role in the process overall.
