  Editorial Quotes

¶1. A/H1N1 
 
"The domestic increase of the A/H1N1 virus in Japan shocks 
neighboring countries" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(05/19): "Yesterday, Japan confirmed that the 
number of A/H1N1 cases in Japan has increased to 139.  Both China 
and South Korea are shocked.  Japan has rung the alarm for an A/H1N1 
breakout.  However, although Asia is nervous and the WHO is very 
busy, North America, the largest virus-affected area, looks very 
relaxed.  Almost all American media reports the mild characteristics 
of the A/H1N1 virus.  Chinese experts indicate that the Chinese 
people should prepare as the virus comes closer to China.  Japan 
puts Asia at a higher risk.  Japan has developed their social 
insurance and medical systems, but many Asian countries have not. 
Chinese experts also believe that the U.S. media seldom discusses 
the responsibility of the U.S. to control the virus.  Chinese 
experts urge the U.S. to increase their exit controls in order to 
decrease the export of the virus to other countries.  Experts also 
indicate that the prevention measures of the U.S. are slow and 
inadequate.  The U.S. government is federal, requiring the 
coordination of the states which is time-consuming; they are not 
organized as China is, as a one government.  The U.S. has advanced 
medical treatment available to deal with the virus.  But it 
increases the burdens and difficulties of other countries in 
preventing the virus." 
 
¶2. CHINESE SPY 
 
"Once again, the U.S. has fabricated a Chinese spy" 
 
Elite Reference (Qingnian Cankao), a newspaper affiliated to the 
official Communist Youth League China Youth Daily (05/19): 
"Recently, a Pentagon Official was sentenced for his involvement 
with a Chinese spy.  The Chinese Foreign Ministry's spokesperson, Ma 
Zhao Xu, said during a press conference that these allegations 
against China are completely baseless.  China doesn't conduct 
surveillance activities in the U.S.  This insinuation reflects the 
ulterior motives of the U.S.  China hopes that the U.S. can give up 
their Cold War mentality and stop accusing China without a 
foundation.  The U.S. media and U.S. government often come up with 
accusations that China is actively collecting information about the 
U.S., but they have no concrete evidence.  Who on earth is 
fabricating this Chinese spy case?  First, the U.S. information 
circle will often create a Chinese spy when its own spying 
activities are revealed, such as the U.S.' activities in the South 
China and East Seas.  Second, are their military hawks.  Third, the 
U.S. is the business and technological opponent of China.  Fourth, 
are the experts and 'brains' who make their living by fabricating 
Chinese spies." 
 
¶3. FINANCIAL CRISIS 
 
"Obama says that the U.S. cannot only borrow money from China" 
 
Elite Reference (Qingnian Cankao), a newspaper affiliated to the 
official Communist Youth League China Youth Daily (05/19): 
"Recently, President Obama has suddenly changed topics. When he 
spoke during a meeting in New Mexico he said 'we cannot always 
borrow money from China.'  However, for the Obama administration, 
who hopes to stimulate the economy with an economic stimulus plan, 
borrowing money from others countries, is still a viable way to 
solve the economic crisis.  The thinking behind borrowing money is 
what will encourage the U.S. to reach out to China for more money. 
It is destined that the U.S. will live with debt because of the 
Bretton Woods system they adopted after World War II.  Will the U.S. 
pay the interest on their borrowed money?  Yes sure, but the U.S. 
does not lose money in the process.  The profit that the U.S. makes 
with borrowed foreign assets is larger than the interest that the 
U.S. pays.  The U.S. has a unique tool, that of the U.S. dollar's 
depreciation, by which it can offset a large part of its debt. 
Obama's concern shows that the U.S. government has a sober awareness 
of its debt.  However, borrowing more money is still the resolution 
to the current economic crisis."
