Summary 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) UN and NGO contacts report that movement of 
humanitarian aid into Gaza continues to face significant 
obstacles.  USAID and NGOs cite increased difficulty in 
securing access since late February.  Despite GOI assurances 
to the USG in March and an Israeli Cabinet decision that all 
food would be allowed, some USAID-procured food items and 
many non-food items continue to face rejection.  Although the 
UN has had some success in bringing in materials for the 2009 
Summer Games, the overall quantity and scope of supplies 
allowed into Gaza is stymieing UN efforts to help Gazans 
recover livelihoods and rebuild.  With the lack of 
construction materials, Gazans are beginning to reconstruct 
buildings using sand, clay, water, and rubble.  End Summary. 
 
Access to Gaza Remains Severely Limited 
--------------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) UNRWA and NGO contacts report that access to Gaza 
slightly deteriorated since February.  Israel continues to 
allow entry for only the most basic humanitarian supplies, 
such as food, medicine, and hygiene materials.  The UN 
Logistics Cluster reported May 2 that roughly 200 MT of 
humanitarian relief items, including recreation kits, 
wheelchairs, toothbrushes, and baby toys, have either 
received no response from COGAT or have been denied.  NGOs 
working in Gaza express frustration with repeated delays and 
rejections.  Some NGOs are considering local procurement 
despite the expense -- 2 to 3 times the cost if procured in 
the West Bank -- and chance that the materials may have been 
smuggled through the tunnels and taxed by Hamas. 
 
¶3. (SBU) UNRWA reported May 5 that an average of 80 
truckloads per day entered Gaza in April, down from an 
average of 110 truckloads in February (reftel) and compared 
to 475 truckloads in April 2007 (pre-Hamas takeover).  Of the 
total commodities in April, 97 percent were food, medicine, 
and hygiene supplies, most commonly detergent, diapers, and 
tissue.   UNRWA also reported that no petrol or diesel has 
been allowed into Gaza from Israel since November 2, 2008, 
although limited, lower-quality supplies are available in the 
Gaza market due to smuggling.  Cooking gas is entering, but 
only enough to meet 55 percent of the need.  No construction 
materials, including cement, glass or rebar, have entered 
Gaza.  A Mercy Corps shipment of three truckloads of window 
glass and wooden beams for a shelter rehabilitation project 
was rejected April 16. 
 
USAID Cites Increased Difficulty 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) USAID and NGO contacts both cite increased 
difficulty in securing access for humanitarian goods since 
negotiations to free captured IDF soldier Gilad Shalit 
collapsed in late February.  For example, on May 4, 24 
pallets of fortified wafers and lentils were rejected for 
reasons related to food packaging.  On other occasions, items 
were approved, but then turned back at Kerem Shalom crossing. 
 For example, the week of April 27, a shipment of cooking oil 
and halva was approved and coordinated with COGAT, but denied 
entry at the crossing.  After hours of negotiation, USAID 
convinced the authorities at the crossing to allow it in. 
USAID also notes that non-food essential items are often 
denied.  For example, 42 pallets of mattresses and floor mats 
were rejected for reasons that remain unclear, although one 
COGAT official suggested that the mats were denied because 
they could be used as prayer mats in mosques. 
 
Isolated Cases of "Other Materials" Entering Gaza 
--------------------------------------------- ---- 
 
¶5. (SBU) Non-food, non-medical, and non-hygiene items 
comprised only three percent of the total commodities allowed 
into Gaza in April.  These materials included plastic pipes 
for the Palestinian Water Authority and supplies for UNRWA's 
2009 Summer Games program, such as clothing, school kits, and 
spray paint.  Other administrative UN requirements, such as 
printing paper, generators, and vehicle spare parts were also 
allowed, but these materials were limited to the UN and have 
not been allowed in for the private sector. 
 
Gazans Use Sand, Rubble, and Water to Re-build

--------------------------------------------- - 
 
¶6. (SBU)  UNRWA Deputy Director Aidan O'Leary told RefCoord 
May 5 that the lack of construction materials in Gaza has 
motivated local universities to develop a new method of 
construction using sand, clay, rubble, and water.  The 
Ministry of Public Works in Gaza plans to build a mosque, a 
school, and a clinic to demonstrate the new method's 
viability.  Meanwhile, Gazans are reconstructing demolished 
homes using traditional methods of mud and thatch.  Photos of 
the construction were emailed to NEA/IPA and PRM/ANE.
