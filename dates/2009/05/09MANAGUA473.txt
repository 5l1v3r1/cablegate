¶1.  (C) Summary.  On April 30, First Lady Rosario Murillo 
distributed a letter from presidential advisor Orlando Nunez 
to media outlets in which Nunez openly criticized Nicaragua's 
Catholic Church.  According to Nunez, the Vatican considered 
the Nicaraguan church as one of the most corrupt in the 
world, and a majority of its bishops "had women and 
children."  Nunez goes on to say that the Church has a 
confrontational approach against the governing Sandinista 
National Liberation Front (FSLN).  On May 4, the Catholic 
Church responded to the letter stating it was a "fictional 
essay" and a product of someone's creative imagination.  The 
Church also asked that the government clarify the origin of 
the document.  On May 5, Murillo then issued a statement 
claiming Nunez' letter was sent by "hackers."  Despite the 
FSLN's attempt to deny responsibility, the party likely 
distributed the letter in an attempt to diminish the Catholic 
Church's influence in Nicaragua, but its attempt appears to 
have backfired.  End Summary.

FSLN Attacks, the Church Responds 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  (C) Since entering into office in 2007, the Ortega 
government has directly attacked on a rotating basis foreign 
missions, non-governmental organizations, and the political 
opposition.  However, its approach with the Catholic Church 
usually had been a bit more indirect.  Rather than attack the 
Church directly, the government usually used the tactic of 
co-opting religious symbols to gain public support (reftel) 
or criticizing the Catholic hierarchy's comments on political 
issues (e.g., fraudulent elections).  That approach, however, 
appeared to change on April 30 when the government 
distributed via electronic mail to media outlets a letter 
from presidential advisor Orlando Nunez to First Lady Rosario 
Murillo.  The letter is titled "Relations Between the Church 
and the Sandinista Front" and is accompanied by a cover note 
signed by Murillo.  In his letter, Nunez provides Murillo his 
assessment on church-state relations based on conversations 
he stated he had with Father Gregorio Raya of the Juigalpa 
Diocese (Department of Chontales). 
 
¶3.  (C) The three-page letter makes two basic arguments. 
First, Nunez paints the Catholic Church in Nicaragua as a 
corrupt institution.  He claims that Pope Benedict XVI named 
a new auxiliary bishop to Managua to halt the corruption in 
Nicaragua's Catholic Church, which Nunez claims the "Vatican 
considers one of the most corrupt (alcohol, money, and 
women)."  A majority of the bishops in Nicaragua, Nunez 
continues, have "women and children" and "steal from 
donations made to Caritas."  (Caritas is the Catholic 
Church's charitable organization.)  Second, Nunez argues that 
the Church in Nicaragua is losing its prestige and authority 
among the population, particularly in the face of a strong 
and popular FSLN government.  As a result, Nunez argues that 
the National Conference of Bishops (CEN by its Spanish 
initials) has a hostile position toward the government and 
takes every opportunity to challenge the authority of the 
government. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) In response to Nunez' letter, on May 4 the CEN held 
a press conference and read a statement addressed to 
Catholics.  The CEN called Nunez' letter a "fictional essay" 
("un ensayo de novela") and made four points: (1) the letter 
should be considered the product of imagination and far from 
the truth; (2) the CEN would request clarification on the 
origins of the document; (3) the CEN thanked Catholics for 
their confidence in their pastors and asked that the Church's 
unity be its strength; and (4) the CEN invited the Catholic 
people to pray for God's compassion and protection. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) On May 5 First Lady Rosario Murillo issued a 
statement claiming Nunez' letter was sent by computer hackers 
and was part of a larger conspiracy against the FSLN. 
However, Bishop Abelardo Mata from Esteli told media he 
doubted the "hacker" defense and questioned the government's 
slow response to the Nunez letter.  A local newspaper's 
technical analysis of both messages (Nunez' letter and 
Murillo's defense) indicated that both were sent from the 
same computer network.

A Rogue Priest, A United Church 
------------------------------- 
 
¶6.  (C) Bishop of Granada Bernard Hombach told us he did not 
doubt that Nunez spoke with Father Raya, but stated the 
accusations against the CEN and the bishops were false. 
(Note: Bishop Hombach personally knows Father Raya, as 
Hombach was formerly the bishop of Juigalpa, the diocese to 
which Father Raya belongs.)  Hombach described Raya as an 
opportunist who sought positions of influence with the 
government, something Raya had attempted with the previous 
two Nicaraguan governments.  According to the Bishop of 
Granada, Father Raya created these stories to gain favor with 
the FSLN and Nunez took the bait.  The governing FSLN, 
thinking it had good ammunition against the Church, then ran 
with the story and distributed it widely in Nicaragua. 
 
¶7.  (C) While most Nicaraguans do not appear to give the 
letter much credibility, members of the Church are concerned 
by the direct attack.  Former CEN President and current 
Bishop of Leon Bosco Vivas told reporters that he believed 
this definitively marked the government's position against 
the Catholic Church.  By contrast, Bishop Vivas told PolOff 
April 2 that the CEN was divided on how to engage with the 
government, arguing that he saw no reason to confront the 
government as long as the government did not directly attack 
the Church.

Comment

¶8.  (C) More telling than the accusations in Orlando Nunez' 
letter against the Catholic Church is the fact that the 
governing FSLN decided to broadly distribute the document. 
This supports the widely held belief that the governing FSLN 
views the Church and its bishops as a competing authority in 
Nicaragua and would like nothing more than to diminish the 
influence of the country's Catholic hierarchy.  With the 
release of the letter the FSLN might also have tried to 
preempt the positive news coverage the CEN is likely to 
receive when it hosts the Conference of Latin America's 
Bishops in Managua on May 11-14. 
 
¶9.  (C) Whether or not the FSLN was duped by Father Raya, the 
fact that the party distributed a letter directly confronting 
the Catholic Church demonstrates the FSLN's inability to 
learn from past mistakes.  Despite Murillo's denial of 
responsibility for the distribution of Nunez' note, the 
governing party's attempt to discredit the Church appears to 
have backfired.  The CEN's position against the government 
seems more unified.  As for trying to garner public support 
behind the government and against the Catholic hierarchy, the 
FSLN has an uphill battle.  The latest polling shows the 
Church with a two to one approval rating over the president. 
The Catholic Church has a 65% approval rating; the presidency 
only 33%.
