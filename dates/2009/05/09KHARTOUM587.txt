SUBJECT: COUNTRY CLEARANCE ISSUES FOR SUDAN 
 
¶1. The Embassy recently eceived a country clearance request from a 
USAID institutional contractor whose contract stipulated that the 
person would be provided USG lodging, transportation, security, and 
other Mission services.  As such, the contractor would be under COM 
authority and require a country clearance.  The contractor also 
intended to travel on a tourist passport to Sudan.  Post would like 
to take this opportunity to remind all travelers to Sudan of country 
clearance requirements. 
 
¶2. Prior to commencing travel to Sudan, all official Americans are 
required to obtain an entry visa through the Sudanese Embassy in 
Washington, D.C., unless extraordinary arrangements have been 
approved and arranged by either U.S. Embassy Khartoum or U.S. 
Consulate General Juba, and receive a country clearance through the 
electronic country clearance process. An Official American is 
defined as a U.S. Direct Hire or Contract Employee whose contract 
states the Embassy will provide logistical support and is 
responsible for the person's safety and security.  The Embassy may 
request to see a copy of the person's contract to verify that 
Mission support is required.  As such, all Official Americans must 
travel to Sudan on a Diplomatic or Official Passport with a valid 
Sudanese visa.  Official travel to Sudan on a tourist passport is 
not/not allowed.  Additionally, Mission Sudan does not permit U.S. 
Government employees to enter southern Sudan on Government of 
Southern Sudan (GOSS) Travel Permits. 
 
¶3. Almost all institutional contractors do not require Mission 
support and are therefore not considered Official Americans.  As 
such, they are considered the same as private Americans and are 
responsible for their own transportation, lodging, security, 
medevac, and other logistical support, and do not require country 
clearance.  This means that they would not be provided with 
accommodations at the U.S. Consulate General residential compound in 
Juba, nor would they be provided with motor pool support.  Any 
questions or concerns regarding country clearance requests should be 
addressed to Embassy Khartoum Management Officer John Kowalski, 
USAID Executive Officer Charles Knight, or USAID/Juba Executive 
Officer Sam Rubino.
