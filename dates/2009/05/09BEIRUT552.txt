¶1. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel demarche to acting Director 
General of the Ministry of Economy and Trade (MOET) Fouad Fleifel on 
May 7.  In addition, Post sent the Special 301 report and comments 
to senior and working level contacts at the Ministries of Culture, 
Health, Finance, Justice, and Administrative Reform.  Post passed 
the information to Lebanon's customs and police departments, 
economic teams of several political parties, and MPs in parliament's 
economic and financial parliamentary committees. 
 
¶2. (SBU) As Lebanon is preparing for the June 7 parliamentary 
elections, Post believes that pursuing the demarche with higher 
level contacts would have a greater effect after the elections, once 
a new cabinet is in place. 
 
¶3. (U) Post will pass on any further GOL comments on the Special 301 
report.  Post POC is EconOff Amy Tachco (tachcoan@state.gov).
