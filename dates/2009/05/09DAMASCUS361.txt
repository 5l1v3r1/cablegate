COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATION 
 
REF: STATE 37649 
 
¶1.  As Charge d'Affaires of the United States Embassy in 
Damascus, I have taken the necessary measures to ensure that 
our employee association is managed prudently and is in full 
compliance with its charter and bylaws, 6 FAM 500 
regulations, applicable to U.S. law, and all legal 
requirements of the Government of Syria.  I also assure you 
that an adequate system of internal controls is in place to 
protect the assets of the association and the interests of 
the U.S. government and that all reporting requirements, to 
include in-house financial statements, independent audit or 
review report, board's statement of auditor's independance 
and Post Profile update have been submitted to A/OPR/CR on 
time.  Finally, I certify that post does not procure services 
from the association or does so only with an approved waiver 
from the Office of the Procurement Executive (FAR 3.601). 
 
¶2.  As previously reported, post continues to dispute an 
erroneous transportation charge from 2003 in the amount of 
USD 65,000.  This disputed amount has been duly noted in each 
audit report. 
 
¶3.  This certification was signed on May 31, 2009, by Charge 
d'Affaires Maura Connelly.
