SUBJECT:  COMOROS DISASTER DECLARATION - WIDESPREAD FLOODING FROM 
EXCESSIVE RAINFALL 
 
¶1. This is an Action Cable. See para 2 and 5 for action required. 
 
SUMMARY: 
 
¶2. Unseasonably heavy and sustained rains in the Comoros from late 
March to mid-April caused extensive damage to buildings, 
infrastructure, and crops.  The Government of the Union of the 
Comoros has declared an official disaster in 41 villages across all 
three islands - the total affected population is estimated over 
100,000 people.  Based on the wide-spread extent of the damage to 
the Union of the Comoros and the government's declaration of 
disaster including a request for international assistance, it is in 
the interest of the US government to assist the Union of Comoros 
with humanitarian assistance.  As such, this cable is a Disaster 
Declaration and post request USAID/OFDA to provide USD 50,000 for 
immediate disaster assistance.  Post will provide these funds to 
UNDP/Comoros, who is coordinating all international assistance and 
will indicate that water, sanitation and hygiene should be a 
priority for the use of these funds. 
 
END SUMMARY 
 
SITUATION: 
 
¶3. Unseasonably heavy rainfall occurred throughout the Comoros 
archipelago from late March to mid-April, resulting in severe 
localized flooding throughout the country. Initial assessments found 
over 500 families had been displaced from their homes, most of which 
are now staying with host families.  Immediate needs include food 
aid and hygiene for displaced families and safe drinking water in 
many communities where cisterns were polluted.  At least 15 bridges 
and many roads have been washed out or damaged, cutting of dozens 
remote communities. 
 
¶4. The GOC has estimated the cost to provide emergency basic needs 
response to affected populations at USD 1.18 million to help 
displaced families relocate and to provide them cooking kits and 
food.  To avert possible public health crises from unsafe drinking 
water, like cholera, the GOC also plans an emergency health and 
sanitation intervention at a cost of USD 247,000 to clean/refill 
cisterns, fund supplies for basic sanitation and clean-up, and 
hygiene/washing-up kits.  In the longer term, the GOC with help from 
donors will seek to repair and replace destroyed infrastructure and 
homes at a cost of up to USD three million. 
 
¶5.  The GOC Civil Protection Unit and Planning Commissioner have 
jointly taken the lead on assessment and emergency response; UNDP is 
coordinating international interventions in response to flooding 
damage.  The Comoran Red Crescent and French Red Cross are also 
participating in relief efforts.  The Chinese, South Africans, and 
UNICEF have already pledged to assist Comorans to respond to flood 
damage. 
 
ACTION REQUIRED: 
 
¶6.  The Chief of Mission has determined that the disaster in the 
Comoros is of sufficient magnitude to warrant U.S. Government 
assistance and is therefore exercising the disaster assistance 
authority of USD 50,000 for emergency response.  Post will provide 
this funding to UNDP, acting as coordinator of all international 
assistance, and will prioritize water and sanitation activities to 
be undertaken.  Post will monitor the situation and depending on the 
extent of additional donor and GOC contributions and any remaining 
gaps, post will coordinate with USAID/OFDA's regional office in 
Pretoria, South Africa, to determine whether and in what form any 
additional assistance may be required.
