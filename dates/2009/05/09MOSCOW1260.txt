REFTELS: REQUEST #4210009; DATED 4/30/2009 
 
¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to determine the 
legitimacy and reliability of the foreign purchaser, Amotec 
Technology, Moscow, Russia. The company is listed on BIS license 
application: D407478 as the foreign purchaser of one single diode 
unbalanced model no: DPL26. This item is controlled for national 
security, missile technology, nuclear non-proliferation and 
anti-terrorism reasons under ECCN 3A001. The licensee is Radar 
Systems Technology, 480 San Antonio Road, Suite 250, Mountain View, 
CA 94040. 
 
¶3. On May 7, 2009, Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested post-shipment 
verification at the offices of Amotec Technology, 100, Dmitrovskoe 
Shosse, bld.2, Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with 
Vladimir Grevtsev, Deputy General Director. 
 
¶4. Amotec Technology was established in 2000 by Victor Mochelov, the 
General Director and has 10 employees. Amotec Technology has been 
importing licensable U.S. origin technology since its inception. 
Their first license was issued in 2000 and it was for purchases made 
from Agilent Technology.  Vladimir Grevtsev stated that Amotec 
Technology has an ongoing 10 year partnership with Agilent 
Technology.  Grevtsev stated that Amotec Technology makes purchases 
for the Russian military, research, space and aviation industries. 
 
¶5. Grevtsev stated that Amotec Technology is very aware of the 
export compliance responsibilities regarding the purchase of 
licensable U.S. technology. He stated that all licensable U.S. 
origin purchases are stored in a locked, limited access warehouse. 
Log books are kept on all purchases. Grevtsev stated the commodity 
in reftel has already been delivered to CIME (Central Research 
Institute of Measuring) and is therefore not available to the export 
control team. 
 
¶6. The export control team found the office space to be considerably 
smaller than that which would be required for the 10 or more 
employees of Amotec Technology. Grevtsev explained that most 
employees are working from home via the Internet. The reftel 
equipment was shipped to the stated end user for the end use for 
which it was licensed. The consigneeQs answers were not evasive. 
 
¶7. Recommendations: Post makes no recommendation for Amotec 
Technology, Moscow, Russia, as a reliable recipient of sensitive 
U.S. origin commodities.  Additional information exists which was 
provided by another agency and should be considered before making a 
final license determination.
