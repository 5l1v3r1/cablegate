SUBJECT: MINISTRY OF JUSTICE RESUMES EXECUTIONS OF DEATH 
ROW INMATES 
 
 ¶1.     (SBU)  SUMMARY:  On May 3, the Ministry of Justice 
executed 12 death-sentenced inmates at the Khadamiya prison 
in Baghdad.   There were 13 inmates scheduled for execution 
on this date, but one sentenced inmate was withdrawn pending 
an ongoing appeal.   Of those executed, 10 were convicted and 
sentenced to death for murder, and two were convicted and 
sentenced to death for kidnapping.  These were the first 
executions carried out since August 21, 2007. 
 
Background 
 
¶2.     (SBU)  Until May 3, the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) had 
not conducted any executions of death row inmates since 
August 21, 2007.  Multiple legal and policy disputes within 
the GOI appear to have contributed to this, but no clear 
conclusions can be drawn as to the cause.  One possible 
reason was the former Acting Minister of Justice Dr. Safa 
al-Safi,s opposition to the death penalty.  Additionally, in 
at least some cases, conflict arose within the GOI regarding 
interpretations of the law requiring executive ratification 
of death sentences. 
 
¶3.    (SBU)  Currently, we are aware of an additional 721 
inmates in the custody of the MOJ who have received death 
sentences in competent Iraqi courts, 105 of whom have 
received the requisite presidential execution order. 
According to our information, all but three of these 
individuals received the death penalty for murder, terrorism, 
insurgency, or kidnapping.  The exceptions were two who were 
convicted of incest and one who was convicted of rape.  We 
are not otherwise aware of any death sentences for crimes 
that the United States or international community would deem 
grossly disproportionate or otherwise inappropriate (such as 
blasphemy, adultery, homosexuality, etc.).  It should be 
noted that our visibility is limited to MOJ facilities, and 
we do not have any information about prisoners with death 
sentences who may be held in facilities maintained by the 
Ministry of Interior or the Ministry of Defense. 
Additionally, there are 83 individuals who have received 
death sentences from competent Iraqi courts, but remain in 
U.S. custody at theater internment facilities (61 at Camp 
Bucca and 22 at Camp Cropper). 
 
¶4.    (SBU)  On February 23, Deputy Minister of Justice Posho 
informed Rule of Law officials that the MOJ was preparing to 
begin executing prisoners under death sentence.  He informed 
us that these death sentences resulted from the lawful 
judicial orders of Iraqi courts and that the executions would 
occur in the presence of a judge, physician, cleric, and 
prison warden. 
 
¶5.    (SBU)  On April 26, Deputy Minister Posho had informed 
Rule of Law officials that the MOJ would begin executions on 
Sunday, May 3 at the rate of no more than 14 inmates per 
week.  He explained that the executions would occur on 
Sundays and continue for several months, beginning with the 
oldest execution orders.  The MOJ now appears to be following 
through with this plan. 
 
Comment 
 
¶6.     (SBU)  The MOJ is aware that the resumption of 
executions may produce a negative reaction from the 
international, particularly NGO, community, and when the 
international community (e.g., the European Union) learned of 
the decision to resume executions, they made the 
recommendation to the GOI to cancel them.  In one instance, 
earlier reports by one NGO of the previously planned 
executions incorrectly claimed that the executions were for 
the "crime" of homosexuality, which generated significant 
negative media attention.  Rule of Law investigation revealed 
these claims to be without merit.   As documented in the 
Qthese claims to be without merit.   As documented in the 
Human Rights Report, though the Iraqi justice system has made 
progress, it continues to face significant challenges.  While 
we have not taken a position on the death penalty with the 
GOI, we have stressed the need for efficient and effective 
due process.  Our Rule of Law programs will continue to 
provide the GOI with practical assistance to work toward 
these goals.
