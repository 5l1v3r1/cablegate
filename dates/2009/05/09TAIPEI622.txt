SUBJECT: TFFLU01: TAIWAN CONFIRMS FOUR ADDITIONAL H1N1 
CASES 
 
REF: TAIPEI 609 AND PREVIOUS 
 
 ¶1. SUMMARY. On May 21, Taiwan health authorities confirmed 
the second, third, fourth and fifth cases of H1N1 in Taiwan. 
All cases with the exception of one came on flights 
originating in the U.S.  The exception is a Taiwan female who 
flew in from Manila.  To date no community spread of the 
virus has been detected.  The Ministry of Education has 
issued a circular urging schools to defer study tours to H1N1 
affected countries such as Mexico and they have also 
suspended MOE funded educational exchanges with Japan. END 
SUMMARY 
 
¶2.  The first case, which arrived in Taiwan May 18, remains 
under quarantine in Taoyuan General Hospital. 57 of 59 
passengers who were seated in close proximity to the first 
H1N1 case have tested negative for the H1N1 virus. Test 
results for the remaining two individuals, both Amcits, are 
still pending as of the afternoon of May 22. 
 
¶3.  The second confirmed H1N1 case is a Taiwan passport 
holder returning from study in the U.S. who flew from New 
York on May 19 Cathay Pacific CX 831 to Hong Kong and then 
continued to Taipei via CX 468 on May 20.  She was stopped at 
the fever monitoring station in Taoyuan Airport with a fever 
of 38.6 C and then sent to the Taoyuan General Hospital and 
quarantined.  A total of 55 persons seated in proximity of 
the patient have been located and samples taken for testing. 
Results of these tests are still pending. 
 
¶4. The third H1N1 case also concerns another Taiwan passport 
holder returning from a short term language program in the 
U.S.  She took Eva Airways flight BR17 from San Francisco on 
May 20 arriving at Taoyuan airport on May 21.  She was 
detected with a temperature of 38 degrees C and referred to 
the Taoyuan General Hospital for treatment.  Taiwan health 
authorities have also tracked down 11 persons who were seated 
in her proximity and obtained samples for testing.  Again, 
test results are still pending. 
 
¶5. The fourth case, a female Taiwanese passport holder, 
arrived from the Philippines on May 20 on board flight PR 
¶896.  She showed no symptoms upon entry but checked into a 
hospital after developing a fever.  Health authorities are 
closely watching her case and that of her daughter who is 
also showing signs of fever. 
 
¶6.  The fifth case is the sister of the third H1N1 case who 
was coughing at the time she returned with her sister to 
Taiwan but did not have fever symptoms.  Because cases four 
and five were only detected after they went home and had 
multiple contacts with their friends and relatives in 
different areas, health authorities are urging those who came 
into close contact with those individuals to take preventive 
medicine and exempted them from sampling and testing.  On May 
21, the Ministry of Education issued a circular letter made 
public advising schools not to organize study tours to areas 
affected by the H1N1 virus.  The letter also announced that 
official MOE-funded study trips to Japan have been suspended 
for the time being. 
 
¶7.  A TCDC contact told us that they are confident that 
airlines are familiar with proper procedures in case a 
passenger is found with fever or flu symptoms.  With the 
sudden increase in cases of the H1N1 virus, health 
authorities are most concerned about community spread of the 
virus.  They are also concerned about a Fall return of the 
H1N1 virus and TCDC recently ordered 1.5 additional doses of 
Tamiflu to supplement their existing stock of 2.3 million 
doses to ensure an adequate supply of Tamiflu is on hand to 
counter a potential outbreak later in the year.
