¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) confirmed 
today another case of A/H1N1 Influenza in Germany, increasing 
the total number of confirmed cases to ten.  One man from 
Saxony-Anhalt tested positive for H1N1 after returning from 
Mexico with flu-like symptoms.  Despite the increase in flu 
cases, RKI sees flu stabilization for Germany.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
Second Case of H1N1 in Saxony-Anhalt 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶2. (SBU) The National Reference Center for Influenza at the 
Robert Koch Institute (RKI) announced in its morning press 
briefing May 7 another laboratory-confirmed case of H1N1 for 
Germany.  This increases the total number of confirmed cases 
in Germany to ten (see Refs B, C, and D). 
 
¶3. (SBU) A man from Wittenberg (Saxony-Anhalt) tested positive 
for H1N1 after returning from a trip to Mexico with flu-like 
symptoms. Media reported that he felt sick during an 
examination by his company's medical officer.  A sample was 
sent to the reference laboratory of the Robert Koch Institute, 
where the virus was detected.  Due to his mild form of flu, he 
was treated at home, and health officials report that he has 
already recovered.  None of the people he has been in contact 
with have shown flu symptoms so far.   This is the second 
confirmed case of H1N1 for the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt 
(first case reported in Ref D).  According to RKI, the men are 
from different counties and are not associates. 
 
 
Stabilization for Germany 
------------------------- 
¶4. (SBU) RKI announced that the epidemic in Germany is "in a 
stabilization phase," but that authorities would not let their 
guard down.  Though optimistic about stabilization, RKI 
expects further spread of the virus in Germany. 
 
 
Airline Planning 
---------------- 
¶5. (SBU)  German airline TUI announced that it would extend 
its cancellation of flights to Mexico City until May 31 -- the 
airline was originally scheduled to resume flights there May 
¶5.  The company's planes will continue to fly to Cancun.
