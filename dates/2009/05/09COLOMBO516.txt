REF: SECSTATE 46946

Classified By: Charge d´Affaires James R. Moore Reasons 1.5(b)(d)
¶1. (S) Charge raised reftel points concerning possible GSL
purchase of lethal military equipment (LME) from North Korea
and Iran with Foreign Minister Bogollagama on May 11.
Bogollagama categorically denied that the GSL is attempting
to procure weapons or arms from either country. He also
underscored that the GSL is aware of international
restrictions concerning weapons sales from North Korea and
Iran, as well as the consequences for doing so. Bogollagama
stated that, at one point in the past, the GSL suspected
North Korea of supplying weapons to the Liberation Tigers of
Tamil Eelam (LTTE). As a result, the GSL contacted the
Government of North Korea to discuss the issue. Bogollagama
did not further elaborate on the outcome of those discussions.
