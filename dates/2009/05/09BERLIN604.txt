¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY.  Germany shares U.S. concerns over the 
worsening situation of IDPs in Pakistan, and is increasing 
its humanitarian assistance to Pakistan as a result.  New 
money for Pakistan's internally displaced persons (IDPs) from 
two different ministries -- the Ministry for Economic 
Cooperation and Development and the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs -- will total around 6 million euros.  Altogether, 
German assistance to Pakistan in 2009 will be about 70 
million euros.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Econoff delivered reftel points to Maren Lipps, 
Pakistan Desk Officer, Ministry for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (BMZ), to encourage prompt and effective 
humanitarian assistance for Pakistan's internally displaced 
persons (IDPs).  Noting concern over the deteriorating 
situation in Pakistan, Lipps said BMZ had just announced an 
additional 5 million euros of humanitarian assistance for 
Pakistan's IDPs on May 15.  This amount, which will be 
channeled via the United Nations High Commissioner for 
Refugees (UNHCR), is over and above the 115 million euros 
pledged at the April 17 Donors' Conference in Tokyo.  Lipps 
added that BMZ had previously committed 5 million euros for 
Pakistan IDPs via the World Food Program (WFP), as well as 10 
million euros via UNHCR's RAHA Initiative.  In sum, BMZ is 
contributing 90 million euros to Pakistan in 2009-2010, 20 
million euros of which will go towards IDPs. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Poloff delivered reftel points to Michael Ahrens, 
Senior Desk Officer for Asia, Humanitarian Aid Task Force, 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA).  The MFA was already 
contributing 1.6 million euros to assist Pakistani IDPs this 
year, 600,000 euros of which had been recently announced in 
reaction to the worsening IDP situation, according to Ahrens. 
 Ahrens acknowledged that Foreign Minister Steinmeier would 
imminently announce an additional contribution for IDPs, but 
was unable to divulge any figures.  He said total aid to 
Pakistan, including humanitarian assistance, from both BMZ 
and MFA would be about 70 million in 2009. 
 
¶4. (U) On May 20, 2009, a press release confirmed that the 
MFA would increase aid to Pakistan's IDPs "by up to one 
million euros."  According to the release, the money will be 
at the disposal of UNHCR to build refugee camps, allocate 
emergency accommodations, and distribute aid supplies.
