SUBJECT: SOMALIA - MOGADISHU FIGHTING CONTINUES FOR A FIFTH DAY 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Summary: Fighting between Islamists and Hisbul Islami and 
the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) continued in Mogadishu May 
¶13.  Somali media report injured and wounded in the hundreds and 
displaced persons in the thousands.  TFG officials tell us Ras 
Kamboni leader Hassan al Turki, and al-Shabaab leaders Gobale and 
Muhktar Robow had arrived in Mogadishu.  In a sign of the 
situation's fluidity, a key Abgal subclan apparently switched 
allegiances to the government.  TFG officials say they repulsed an 
attack on May 13, and continue to hold defensive positions along the 
Sodonka Road, though they tell us difficult challenges lie ahead. 
End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Fighting between Islamic extremist groups Al-Shabaab and 
Hisbul Islami, and the TFG resumed May 13 in Mogadishu.  Somali 
media report over 100 people have been killed.  Development 
assistance counterparts confirm that displaced citizens now number 
in the thousands. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) An audibly more nervous Prime Minister Omar Sharmarke told 
us May 13 that the TFG continues to hold defensive positions in the 
lower Yaqshid and Wardhigley districts, roughly along Sodonka road. 
A late-morning attack against TFG positions in the Fagah 
neighborhood of Yaqshid, in the vicinity of Bacaad Market, or 
roughly two kilometers from Villa Somalia, was repulsed, according 
to Security Minister Omar Hashi.  Hashi also told us that Islamists, 
supported by "hundreds" of non-Somali jihadists, were gathering in 
the Kilometer Four area of southwest Mogadishu.  Africa Union troops 
have several bases in the area, but according to reports, they were 
not under concerted attack, and remained in their camps, possibly in 
accordance with their mandate, but also maybe because they assessed 
that their involvement would interfere with the TFG's plans. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) At mid-afternoon mortar shelling was reported in the 
vicinity of presidential offices at Villa Somalia.  A contact at 
Villa Somalia told us AMISOM responded with a counter barrage, 
successfully suppressing the shelling.  Reaching Security Minister 
Omar Hashi again, he informed us of reports Ras Kamboni leader 
Hassan al Turki, and al-Shabaab leaders Gobale and Muhktar Robow had 
arrived in Mogadishu to encourage their fighters.  We asked Hashi 
his assessment of the strategic situation.  He responded laughing, 
"We cannot be scared of monkeys.  These are monkeys.  We have the 
upper hand." 
 
¶5.  (SBU) President Sharif continued to publicly lobby for the 
fighting to stop.  On May 13, at a ceremonial signing of a recently 
passed Sharia law bill, he called for an end to the hostilities, and 
reiterated the need for dialogue.  He pointed out the fighting's 
devastating effects on civilians.  President Sharif's security 
secretary told us the President calmly answered journalist's 
questions.  Meanwhile, according to our contacts, an al-Shabaab 
spokesman was on the radio proclaiming "We are at war with evil.  We 
urge the people to support and stand by us. We are nearing victory 
to create a true Islamic government." 
 
¶6.  (SBU) On May 13, former deputy defense minister Jelle 
(Hawiye/Abgal) reported a key meeting on May 12 between Abgal 
community leaders at a private home near the National Stadium.  At 
the meeting, Abgal/Wa'esli leaders, key among them Abdulkadir Adani, 
former Courts financier, agreed to rejoin Abgal subclans in support 
of the government.  Jelle said the Wa'esli subclan was alarmed by 
the recent apparent coalescing of Habr Gedr militias with al-Shabaab 
against the government.  At the meeting, skeptical Abgal sub-clan 
leaders challenged the Wa'eslis to prove their new allegiance to the 
government.  They ordered the Wa'esli leaders to deny al-Shabaab 
access to the Wa'esli's upper-Yaqshid district stronghold, from 
which al-Shabaab launched attacks on May 9-11.  On May 13, upper 
Yaqshid was quiet.  Al-Shabaab was forced launched attacks into the 
Bacaad Market area from Wardhigley instead, our contacts tell us. 
Jelle claimed the Abgal were discussing contributing fighters to the 
government.
