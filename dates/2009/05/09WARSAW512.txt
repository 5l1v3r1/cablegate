Â¶1. (SBU) EconOff delivered reftel demarche May 19 to Krzystof 
Buzalski from the Polish MFA's Department of Economic 
Cooperation.  On May 17, the Polish government announced an 
immediate transfer of EUR 300,000 through the International 
Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).  The Polish Embassy in 
Islamabad had recommended that the donation be channeled 
either through the ICRC or UNHCR, rather than delivered 
directly to the Pakistani government.  Buzalski was 
interested in information on the mechanisms the USG will use 
to deliver its aid contribution.  The Poles will continue to 
monitor events in the Northwest Frontier Province, and regret 
that the number of refugees is increasing, but stated they 
hope the current operations will be successful against the 
insurgents, and noted the importance of such success to 
ISAF's mission in Afghanistan.  Notwithstanding Poland's 
immediate response to the current crisis, Pakistan has not 
been a focus of Polish aid efforts, and there are no plans to 
provide Polish project assistance to Pakistan.
