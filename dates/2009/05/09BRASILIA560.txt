DISTRIBUTION.  PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) This report provides an update on developments in Brazil 
regarding the swine flu outbreak. 
 
NEW REPORTED CASES: 
 
¶2.  (SBU) There are no confirmed cases of the H1N1 flu in Brazil, 
which is most likely due to the fact that Brazil does not yet have 
the necessary materials to begin testing.  The Ministry of Health 
expects that once Brazil begins to actively test samples a number of 
the current suspected cases of H1N1 will be confirmed.  As of the 
afternoon of Wednesday, May 6, the Brazilian Ministry of Health, in 
conjunction with the National Agency on Health Vigilance (ANVISA) in 
Brazil are reporting 28 suspected cases of H1N1 in 10 of Brazil's 27 
states and the Federal District, and are monitoring 28 other cases 
spread throughout 20 states and the Federal District. 
 
BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT'S RECENT ACTIONS: 
 
¶3.  (SBU) On Tuesday, May 5, ANVISA announced that it will begin to 
monitor international travel across Brazil's land borders.  ANVISA 
officials are working with bus companies in Brazil to establish a 
monitoring system similar to the system already in operation at 
Brazil's international airports.  ANVISA is asking international bus 
lines and their employees to inform ANVISA officials of passengers 
coming into Brazil with flu-like symptoms.  These passengers will 
then be taken by ANVISA to an isolated area for further observation. 
 ANVISA decided to initiate these plans in wake of Colombia's 
confirmation of an H1N1 case out of fear that the virus could reach 
Brazil through a land crossing. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) As of May 5 the press was quoting Ministry of Health 
sources stating that the rapid testing kits had not yet reached 
Brazil.  However, several sources still estimate that test results 
could be ready as early as Friday, May 8. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Due to the flu outbreak, the Brazilian Government recently 
cancelled an international conference in Belem and a trip to the 
United States by the president of the state owned energy company 
Petrobras to participate in the Offshore Technology Conference being 
held this week in Houston, Texas. 
 
DEVELOPMENTS WITH MISSION BRAZIL: 
 
¶6.  (SBU) Beginning May 5, applicants for consular services (visas 
and American Citizens Services) Mission-wide who feel ill or have 
flu-like symptoms are being encouraged to re-schedule their 
appointments and return when they're well.  The normal re-scheduling 
fee for nonimmigrant visa customers will be waived.  This 
information has been posted on the scheduling website, and the 
Mission's website.  Additionally Consular sections are encouraging 
Greeters who notice a customer exhibiting flu-like symptoms to 
advise them of the option.  Hand sanitizer has also been placed at 
the points of entry and in back offices. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Mission Brazil's Flu Working Group has committed to 
reviewing the Mission's tripwires after the current pandemic 
subsides in order to incorporate the severity of a pandemic, rather 
than simply focusing on its spread.
