¶1. (SBU) Summary: CODEL Pelosi met with Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng 
and other Shanghai and Chinese officials on May 25 at Shanghai's 
City Hall.  The CODEL discussed Shanghai's efforts to promote 
greater energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions 
due to the importance of addressing the global climate change 
crisis.  Mayor Han noted that given its population of 19 million 
people and its per capita density of only 84 square feet per 
person, Shanghai is working hard to do its part to address 
global climate change and to grow in an environmentally friendly 
way while meeting the needs of its growing population. 
Shanghai, as it prepares for the 2010 World Expo, is currently 
building more than 100 new subway stations for its expanding 
subway system and focusing on meeting Central Government 
guidelines for emissions.  End summary. 
 
 
 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Shanghai Mayor Han Zheng warmly welcomed Speaker Pelosi 
and the other members of her delegation to Shanghai City Hall on 
behalf of Shanghai's 19 million people on May 25.  Mayor Han 
remarked that Shanghai and San Francisco have had a sister-city 
relationship since 1980 and is looking forward to celebrating 
the thirtieth anniversary of this friendly and cooperative 
relationship next year while Shanghai hosts the 2010 World Expo. 
 Speaker Pelosi thanked Mayor Han for his welcome and noted that 
the purpose of her trip to China was to explore ways that China 
and the United States could cooperate to mitigate global climate 
change and develop new technologies that increase energy 
efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and pollution. 
 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) Representative Markey, noting the many signs of ongoing 
construction apparent all over Shanghai, asked what types of 
regulations Shanghai enforced to insure that these new 
constructions were energy efficient since buildings account for 
approximately 40 percent of energy consumed.  Mayor Han 
responded that energy efficiency and reducing each individual's 
energy consumption was incredibly important to Shanghai's city 
planners given Shanghai's dense population.  Even if every 
individual's energy consumption is low, the overall consumption 
for a city the size of Shanghai is "massive," he said.  Since 
2006, Shanghai's local governments have implemented a series of 
regulations for new buildings that require a 50 percent increase 
in energy efficiency.  This has included the adaptation and 
adoption of new technologies such as LED (light emitting diode) 
lighting, he added. 
 
 
 
¶4. (SBU) In response to a question from Representative 
Sensenbrenner on what Shanghai is doing to support energy 
efficient technologies, Mayor Han said the Shanghai Municipal 
Government actively discourages individuals from owning and 
using private cars and encourages people to use public mass 
transit.  In preparation for Shanghai's World Expo in 2010, 
Mayor Han noted that there were currently 100 new subway 
stations under construction as Shanghai extends its underground 
rail system.  In 2007, the Shanghai city government also set up 
a fund to reward any technological or practical solutions that 
lead to greater energy efficiency in both the public and private 
sectors.  Shanghai's premier universities, such as Jiaotong, 
Fudan, Tongji and the Science and Technology Universities also 
are working on the research and development of new technologies 
that will lead to greenhouse gas reductions, he said. 
 
 
 
¶5. (SBU) Representative Blumenauer, noting that the U.S. "lost 
 
SHANGHAI 00000232  002 OF 003 
 
 
almost half a century" building roads and new urban and suburban 
residential areas that weren't adequately planned or integrated, 
inquired as to what steps Shanghai has taken to more 
intelligently apply land-use in its planning.  Mayor Han agreed 
that intelligent urban land-use planning is incredibly important 
for new developments.  He noted that while New York City has 
approximately 28 square meters (301 square feet) for each 
resident, Shanghai's huge population means that there is only 
7.8 square meters (84 square feet) for every person in 
Shanghai's urban areas.  This creates great pressure on city 
planners to insure that enough land is set aside for roads and 
green space as well as residential and commercial uses. 
 
 
 
¶6. (SBU) U.S. companies in Shanghai had informed Representative 
Speier, in a CODEL meeting earlier in the day (septel), that the 
Shanghai Municipal Government "acted in a fairly transparent 
manner, especially with regard to the judicial branch," she 
said.  Given that the United States and China are together the 
largest emitters of greenhouse gases, responsible for 40 percent 
of all emissions, they should cooperate on finding technological 
ways to solve this problem, she urged.  "As China reduces it 
emissions, how would Shanghai measure its compliance?" asked 
Representative Speier.  Mayor Han responded that since we are in 
a global village, we are all global villagers and have a special 
responsibility to cooperate to reduce emissions.  The Municipal 
Government has taken the lead in Shanghai in attempting to 
introduce environmentally-friendly regulations, he said. 
Shanghai invests 3 percent of its yearly GDP in environmental 
protection.  The Central Government sets emissions reduction 
targets every year in April, and should Shanghai not meet its 
targets, Mayor Han said he would be called to Beijing to "answer 
to my supervisors and get rebuked."  So far, though, he has not 
yet been called to Beijing for such a rebuke, he said with a 
smile.  Mayor Han also realizes that combating global climate 
change is too big a job for Shanghai's municipal-level 
government and so "it has enlisted all levels of government and 
sectors of society" to contribute to this task, he added. 
 
 
 
¶7. (SBU) Representative Markey asked the Mayor his opinion on 
whether it would be possible to actually monitor emissions and 
emissions-reductions from specific sectors, such as steel or 
aluminum foundries, should the United States and China reach an 
agreement to reduce greenhouse gases.  Mayor Han side-stepped 
the question, responding that to reach a global agreement on the 
reduction of greenhouse gases, it would be important to create a 
"scientific set of measurements" that both accounted for a 
country's aggregate greenhouse gas emissions as well as its per 
capita emissions.  The Mayor also said that it would be 
important to note the emissions of a country that are related to 
its "production" and emissions that are related to a country's 
"consumption." 
 
 
 
¶8. (SBU) Speaker Pelosi closed the meeting noting that what the 
CODEL was learning in Shanghai and would learn in Beijing would 
better prepare the United States to address the global climate 
change crisis and assist the United States in preparing for the 
upcoming climate meetings in Copenhagen.  She also made a strong 
pitch for Shanghai support for the protection of any 
intellectual property rights that come out of the development of 
new technologies to increase energy efficiency and reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions.  Mayor Han extended an invitation for 
the Speaker and other Members of the delegation to return to 
Shanghai next year to enjoy both China and see the U.S. national 
pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai World Expo.  (Note:  Funding and 
construction of a U.S. national pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai 
World Expo is not yet assured at this late date.  End note.)
