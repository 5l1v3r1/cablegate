SUBJECT: TURKEY CONDEMNS DPRK NUCLEAR TEST 
 
¶1. MFA issued a statement on May 25 condemning North Korea's 
announcement of a nuclear test and urging the DPRK to comply 
with its obligations. 
 
¶2. BEGIN TEXT OF PRESS STATEMENT (UNOFFICIAL TRANSLATION): 
We condemn the nuclear test announced by the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea on 25 May 2009.  This represents 
an act far from fulfilling expectations of the international 
community striving for peace and stability to prevail in the 
region.  We are seriously concerned about this incident 
announced by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea which 
represents a violation of the relevant United Nations 
Security Council Resolutions, and urge that the Democratic 
People's Republic of Korea take swift steps for the promotion 
of peace and stability, as well as building confidence in the 
region and to comply with its obligations.  Turkey continues 
to attach importance to the denuclearization of the Korean 
Peninsula and to the continuation of the Six Party Talks 
process.   END TEXT
