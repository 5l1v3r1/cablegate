(SBU) Following up on refs A and B, econoff spoke at length 
May 14 with Jose Luis Rodriguez de Colmenares, Deputy 
Director for Economic Relations with OECD countries at the 
MFA and provided additional background on the events leading 
to the issuance of the TDO to Orion Air.  Colmenares, who 
appeared well-informed of the situation, indicated that he 
had been in touch with other GOS agencies as well as Orion 
Air concerning the matter, adding that the GOS was in the 
process of determining its authority and position.  For that 
reason, he made no commitment concerning our request that the 
GOS attempt to prevent the second aircraft from being shipped 
to Syria, though he stated that the GOS wanted to be helpful 
to the USG.  Econoff stressed the urgency of the matter, 
noting post's understanding that the company planned to send 
the aircraft o/a May 15.  Colmenares, however, expressed 
surprise and indicated that he understood, based on his 
involvement in the matter, that the second aircraft was not 
to be shipped until near the end of May.  Post will continue 
to engage the GOS on this issue.
