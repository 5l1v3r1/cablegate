REF: HONG KONG 816 
 
¶1. On May 7, Hong Kong health authorities began the phased 
release of the approximately 350 individuals (240 of which 
are foreign nationals, including 10 AMCITS) placed in 
quarantine due to exposure to the H1N1-positive patient 
confirmed in Hong Kong on May 1 (Reftel).  The first group of 
35 individuals were released at 1400.  This group consisted 
of individuals that sat in the same section of the aircraft 
as the H1N1-positive patient on his arrival flight from 
Shanghai on 30 April and the taxi driver who took the H1N1 
patient to his hotel for check-in.  The driver who took him 
from the hotel to the hospital was released at 2000 hrs. Most 
of the remaining individuals in quarantine, 283 guests and 
staff at the Metropark Hotel where the H1N1 patient checked 
in prior to going to the hospital, will be released at 2030 
hrs on Friday, May 8.  With these releases only three 
individuals will remain in quarantine: two recent arrivals 
unrelated to the contact case who meet the reporting criteria 
(flu-like symptoms and recent travel to an H1N1 confirmed 
area), who will remain in quarantine until H1N1 tests are 
complete, and the H1N1 patient, who remains hospitalized in 
stable condition. 
 
¶2. None of the individuals placed in quarantine developed 
strong flu-like symptoms or tested positive for H1N1, 
including two traveling companions of the H1N1 patient. 
Post's ACS staff have been in regular contact with the ten 
AMCITS in quarantine and assisting throughout the ordeal. 
Consulate staff will be at the Metropark hotel for the 
quarantine release on May 8 to assist the AMCITS and ensure 
there are no unanticipated issues with their release and 
departure.  Each person released from quarantine is being 
given a final medical check and a specially prepared letter 
indicating they have fulfilled the Hong Kong quarantine 
requirements, did not develop symptoms and are cleared for 
travel by the HKG Department of Health.  Upon release from 
quarantine, those not immediately departing Hong Kong are 
being provided an optional two nights free lodging at a 
choice of local Hong Kong hotels or provided transportation 
to a mass transit station. Hong Kong authorities are still 
searching for five guests registered at the hotel who did not 
report for quarantine.
