¶1.  (SBU) Pol Chief discussed reftel points, including UAE Foreign 
Minister Abdullah's remarks about supporting TFG security forces, on 
May 4 with MFA Department of Arab Affairs Director (Ambassador) 
Mohammed Sultan Saif al-Sowaidi.  Al-Sowaidi clearly stated UAEG 
support for the TFG and Sheikh Sharif, agreeing that this is an 
important juncture in which to lend financial support as well.  He 
said current funding mechanisms focus on the Arab League, to which 
the UAEG makes contributions (he referred to an aggregate Arab League 
donation of $3 million monthly).  The Arab League also supports 
AMISON, he noted. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The UAE's bilateral assistance to Somalia is primarily in 
humanitarian relief, said al-Sowaidi, and largely coordinated through 
the UAE Red Crescent.  Pol Chief reiterated the need of the 
international community, including the UAEG, to increase support for 
the TFG.
