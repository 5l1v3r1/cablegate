SUBJECT: BOI GOVERNOR FISCHER DISCUSSES UTILITY OF JEDG 
 
In a May 18th meeting Bank of Israel Governor Stanley Fischer 
discussed with EconCouns the future of the U.S.-Israel Joint 
Economic Development Group (JEDG).  Fischer viewed the JEDG 
as a useful forum for the U.S. to express its views on 
Israeli economic policy.  He noted that the JEDG also 
provided an opportunity for the bilateral exchange of views 
on economic best practices.  For these reasons, Fischer said 
that the JEDG would be valuable even in the absence of the 
current loan guarantees.  In his opinion, the future JEDG 
could look much like the bilateral economic forums that the 
U.S. has with other countries, such as Egypt, or as an 
economic parallel to the U.S. - Israel Defense Policy 
Advisory Group (DPAG) engagement on military issues.
