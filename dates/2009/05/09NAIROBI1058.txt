SUBJECT: SOMALIA - TWO JOURNALISTS KILLED WITHIN A WEEK 
 
¶1. (SBU) Summary:  Two Somali journalists died in the past 
week, one while proceeding to work in Mogadishu and the other 
after succumbing to a bullet wound received while covering 
fighting in Beled Weyne.  These incidents mark the third and 
fourth deaths of Somali journalists in 2009.  Post has 
conveyed condolences to the families and colleagues of those 
involved. End summary. 
 
----------------- 
Two Deaths in the 
Space of a Week 
----------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) Abdirisak Warsame Mohamed, a reporter for Shabelle 
Media Center, was killed by a stray bullet as he walked to 
work in Mogadishu on the morning of May 22.  Our contacts 
indicate Mohamed was killed near the police station in the 
Wardigley area of Mogadishu, which was the epicenter of that 
day's fighting between government and opposition forces. 
Several sources verified that Mohamed was caught in 
crossfire. No one was able to pinpoint whether the bullet 
came from government or opposition forces.  The Somali 
Coalition for Freedom of Expression (SOCFEX) and National 
Union of Somali Journalists (NUSOJ), among others, issued 
statements lamenting the death and noting the difficult 
environment for journalists in Somalia.  Mohamed was single 
and had no children. 
 
¶3. (SBU) On May 26, Radio Voice of Holy Quran reporter Nur 
Muse Hussein succumbed to injuries sustained in an April 20 
shooting in Beled Weyne.  Our contacts tell us Hussein and 
three other journalists were covering fighting between 
pro-government Islamic Courts forces and the opposition 
Hisbul Islam.  We are told that when Hussein and three others 
identified themselves as journalists, Hisbul Islam forces 
fired at them, killing a passing pedestrian instantly and 
injuring Hussein and at least one of his colleagues.  Hussein 
had been in serious condition since the attack, but 
deteriorated last week and died on May 26.  NUSOJ and 
Reporters Without Borders issued statements condemning the 
death.  Hussein's wife and five children survive him.

¶4. (SBU) Post has actively researched both of these 
incidents, and passed our condolences to the stations at 
which both men worked, as well as to journalist organizations 
such as SOCFEX and NUSOJ.  We are also conveying a letter of 
condolence to Hussein's widow.
