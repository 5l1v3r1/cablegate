Morocco will "definitely vote, well ahead of the June 3 
deadline" on Kosovo's application for World Bank membership, 
confirmed Ali Lamrani, chief of the Division of Financing and 
Multilateral Relations of Morocco's Treasury.  However, 
Lamrani told Econoff during the May 27 follow-up to Ref A 
demarche, he could not report at this time the position 
Morocco would take (for, against, or abstain).  The Treasury 
and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation were 
still deliberating Morocco's position, but would know by next 
week and could inform Econoff at that time, he concluded.
