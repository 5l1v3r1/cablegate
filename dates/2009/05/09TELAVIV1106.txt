CHECK ON LICENSE 050098194 
 
REF: STATE 28636 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Per reftel, ODC Chief and MCPO conducted a site 
survey on May 14 to verify the continued possession by the 
Israel Defense Forces (IDF) of 35 Night Vision Goggles 
(PVS-7D - Nivisys).  ODC offs confirmed that all reftel night 
vision devices (NVDs) were accounted for with the exception 
of serial number 08100024.  According to Kobi Fogler from the 
MOD's Directorate of Security, Defense Establishment 
(MALMAB), this particular NVD was issued to the Southern 
Command on January 10, 2009.  According to an IDF 
investigation conducted on February 8, the soldier who had 
been issued the NVD was injured during Operation Cast Lead on 
January 14 after a suicide bomber detonated near the 
soldier's vehicle.  The soldier was evacuated to a nearby 
hospital where it was determined that he no longer had the 
NVD in his possession.  An IDF search at the detonation site 
following the attack was unable to locate the NVD.  The 
brigade commander did not see any reason to resort to 
disciplinary measures, and requested that "operational 
destruction" for the device be approved.  The NVD was 
officially reported as a "war time loss" on March 24, 2009, 
and was included as part of the IDF's monthly NVD 
shortage/loss report to ODC.  All other reftel devices are 
currently stored at the IDF base in Gefen, and are reportedly 
being used for the purposes stated on the license.
