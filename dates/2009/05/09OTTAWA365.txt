¶1.  (U) The Canadian government on May 14 launched a pilot 
project to match individual online donations to aid 
organizations participating in Canada's reconstruction and 
development effort in Afghanistan.  The 'Afghanistan 
Challenge' encourages individual Canadians to participate 
directly in government-NGO partnerships in Kandahar, while 
raising awareness of and perhaps bolstering support for the 
overall mission. 
 
¶2.  (U) Ottawa is partnering with four Canadian NGOs for the 
first, six month phase:  CARE Canada, the Mennonite Economic 
Development Associates (MEDA), Rotary International, and 
World University Service Overseas (WUSC).  The partnership 
focuses on Canadian Signature Projects in Kandahar that align 
with the Afghanistan National Development Strategy.  In 
particular, the projects (1) provide vocational training 
scholarships for women, (2) furnish micro-loans to female 
entrepreneurs, and (3) support school construction.  Canadian 
aid and NGO officials have set a goal of raising C$500,000 
from Canadians during the first stage.  Pending review of the 
first phase, a second would commence in the fall of 2009 and 
continue through to 2011 (septel). 
 
¶3.  (U) Individual Canadians can donate funds to the project 
via www.AfghanistanChallenge.ca and are encouraged to use 
web-tools to engage other prospective donors through personal 
contact and social networking sites.  They also can track the 
results of their contributions via the Afghanistan Challenge 
website.
