CHINESE PRESS CRITICAL OF UNITED STATES RESPONSE TO H1N1 
--------------------------- ----------------------- ---- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) Mainland Chinese newspapers (both Chinese and 
English-language publications) have criticized U.S. government 
response to the H1N1 outbreak, blaming the "low-key approach" of the 
government and media for what it sees as ineffective prevention 
measures against the spread of the virus. The press also faults the 
U.S. public as "indifferent to the danger" and urges the United 
States to take much stronger measures in controlling its borders to 
prevent the spread of H1N1 to other countries. (Note: Hong Kong also 
saw accusations of weak U.S. response in the press after a second 
H1N1 case was confirmed in Hong Kong on May 13. See REF B. End 
note.) 
 
 
TWO CONFIRMED CASES OF H1N1 CASES ON MAINLAND CHINA 
--------------------- ----------------- ----------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) As of COB May 15, the number of confirmed H1N1 cases on 
Mainland China remains unchanged at two (REF C and E). Hong Kong 
also has two confirmed cases of H1N1, the first confirmed on May 1 
(REF F), and a second case confirmed on May 13 (REF B). 
 
 
STATUS OF AMCIT QUARANTINE CASES 
--------------------- ---------- 
 
¶3. (SBU) As of May 15, 85 American citizens are reported to be in 
quarantine throughout China - 50 are currently quarantined in 
Beijing and 35 are quarantined in twelve other provinces and 
municipalities across China. Of these, 62 were passengers on the May 
8 NW029 flight from Tokyo to Beijing with China's first confirmed 
case of H1N1. 
 
--Of the 50 AmCits quarantined in Beijing, 40 are being quarantined 
at the Guomen Hotel, 7 are being quarantined at the Jinglin Hotel, 2 
are under observation at Ditan Hospital, and one is under home 
quarantine. Twelve of the seventeen AmCits are quarantined in 
Shandong, Gansu, Shaanxi, Hebei, Henan and Hubei provinces (in 
Beijing's Consular district) were also on the May 8 NW029 flight 
from Tokyo to Beijing. If the AmCits who were on the May 8 NW029 
flight remain asymptomatic, they should be released on May 16. 
 
--There are now eleven AmCits in quarantine in the Shanghai Consular 
District. Five of these were on board NW025 from Detroit to Tokyo 
(Narita) on May 8 with the four confirmed H1N1-infected Japanese 
passengers (who remain in Japan (REF F). Four AmCits were placed 
into quarantine on May 15 after arriving that day on flight VS250 
from the United Kingdom where they sat in close proximity to a 
passenger who exhibited a high temperature. Another AmCit was 
quarantined upon arrival on May 14 because he had transited Mexico 
on May 12, before flying to Shanghai via the United States. Post was 
notified on May 15 of one AmCit who has been in quarantine in Suzhou 
(Jiangsu Province) since May 8, who is due to be released later in 
the day. 
 
--Five AmCits are in quarantine in the Guangzhou Consular District, 
including four in Guangdong who were on the May 8 NW029 flight and 
one in Changle (Fujian Province). 
 
--Two AmCits remain in quarantine in Kunming (Yunnan Province).

complete their adoptions. One large U.S. adoption agency has 
confirmed that they have asked prospective adopting parents to delay 
travel for at least a week before they reassess the situation.
