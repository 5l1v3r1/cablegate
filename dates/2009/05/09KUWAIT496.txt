SUBJECT: KUWAIT REVIEW OF TITLE III SUSPENSION OF LIBERTAD 
ACT 
 
REF: SECSTATE 48487 
 
¶1. (U) The following is post's response to reftel on 
implementation of Title III of the LIBERTAD Act. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Cuba has a diplomatic presence in Kuwait, but the 
GOK does not maintain a mission in Cuba.  Relations between 
the two countries have been somewhat strained since the 
1990-91 Gulf War when Cuba objected to UN/U.S./Coalition 
"interference" to liberate Kuwait. According to the Kuwait 
Investment Authority, there are no GOK investments in Cuba, 
and no known private Kuwaiti investments.  Kuwait and Cuba 
have not signed any bilateral trade agreements, and data from 
the Kuwait Chamber of Commerce reveals limited trade with 
Cuba.  According to the most recent data available from the 
Council of Ministers' General Secretariat for Planning and 
Development, Cuban exports to Kuwait (overwhelmingly cigars) 
amounted to KD 50,863 (approx USD 176,000) in 2006.  There 
are negligible Kuwait exports to Cuba. 
 
¶3. (SBU) There are no exchange programs between Kuwait and 
Cuba.  The GOK does provide scholarships for Kuwaiti students 
to attend college abroad, but Post is unaware of any Kuwaitis 
enrolled in Cuban colleges.  Similarly, the GOK provides for 
medical treatment abroad, but Post is unaware of any Kuwaitis 
who have sought or received medical treatment in Cuba.  Post 
is unaware of any Cuban doctors working in Kuwait. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Post is not aware of any actions taken, or 
statements made, by GOK officials to promote the advancement 
of democracy and human rights in Cuba, to condemn human 
rights abuses in Cuba, or to support civil society in Cuba. 
 
¶5. (SBU) On April 14, 2008, Cuban Minister of Foreign 
Investment and Economic Cooperation Martha Lomas was hosted 
by the Kuwaiti Ministry of Commerce and Industry.  Other than 
meetings with the Kuwaiti Chamber of Commerce, Post is 
unaware of other private or official engagements by Minister 
Lomas while in Kuwait last year.
