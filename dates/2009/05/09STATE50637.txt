E.O. 12958: N/A 
TAGS: ETTC KOMC NZ
SUBJECT: BLUE LANTERN LEVEL 3: POST-LICENSE/PRE-SHIPMENT 
END-USE CHECK ON LICENSE 050169981 
 
¶1. This is an Action Request. See paragraphs 2 - 4. 
 
¶2. The Department's Office of Defense Trade Controls 
Compliance (PM/DTCC) requests Post's assistance in conducting 
a post-license/pre-shipment check on license 050169981 for 
the export of firearms to New Zealand.  Post is requested to 
complete this Blue Lantern check within 30 days. Lack of 
response to a Blue Lantern check will affect pending and 
future licenses involving parties to this license. 
 
¶3. Reason for Request: The end-user claims to be using these 
firearms for "IPSC completion and target shooting events" but 
the license is for eleven firearms, including eight of the 
same make and model.  The quantity appears to be relatively 
high for personal end-use.  This request is for Post to 
confirm end-use and determine if any of these firearms are 
for resale. 
 
¶4. Action Request:  Post is requested to verify the end-use 
of the firearms listed below by making appropriate inquiries 
to Mr. Chris Gee.  Post is also requested to determine why 
Mr. Gee needs eleven firearms; eight of which are of the same 
make and model.  Finally, Post is requested to determine if 
any of the firearms are for resale and to remind Mr. Gee that 
any retransfer or re-export requires authorization of the 
United States Department of State (Note: The International 
Traffic in Arms Regulation is available at 
www.pmddtc.state.gov/regulations laws/itar official.html). In 
its reply, Post is encouraged to comment on any information 
pertinent to this transaction such as security of facilities, 
end-use, and concerns about the entities involved.
