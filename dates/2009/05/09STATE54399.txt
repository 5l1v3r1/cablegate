 ¶1. (U) This is an action request. Please see paragraph 3. 
 
---------------------- 
BACKGROUND 
---------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU)  Prior to the Berlin Plenary last year, Washington 
provided all Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) Participating 
Government (PGs) with detailed information regarding the 
critical commodities Iran will require to support the 
deployment of the next generation of gas centrifuges for its 
uranium enrichment program (REF A).  At the Plenary, the 
United States presented for the Information Exchange Meeting 
(IEM) on Iran,s progress in developing the IR-2 centrifuge 
and items it would need to procure (REF B).  At that 
Plenary,s IEM, the UK, France, Australia, Germany, 
Switzerland, and the Netherland all gave presentations on 
Iran.  Additionally, France made an Iran - related 
presentation at the Licensing and Enforcement Exports 
Meetings (LEEM).  The upcoming NSG Plenary in Budapest the 
week of June 8th is another excellent opportunity to share 
with other NSG Participating Governments (PGs) information on 
Iran,s nuclear supply needs, as well as ideas on ways to 
counter Iranian procurement and better enforce the 
prohibitions laid out in the United Nations Security Council 
Resolutions (UNSCRs) on Iran.  There are many opportunities 
during the week of the Plenary, including the IEM and LEEM, 
to brief other PGs or present papers on Iran that can 
strengthen the national export control implementation and 
enforcement practices of the 45 partners.  The United States 
is preparing to do presentations during both the IEM and the 
LEEM that are Iran - specific.

OBJECTIVES/ACTION REQUEST 
------------------------- 
 
¶3. (SBU)  Washington requests Posts deliver the non-paper in 
paragraph 4 to appropriate host government officials in the 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
 
-- Note the importance of keeping all NSG partners informed 
about Iran,s nuclear program. 
 
-- Note that the United States is preparing an IEM 
presentation on Uranium extraction from phosphates, as well 
as a LEEM presentation on U.S. industry outreach efforts to 
prevent Iran from acquiring U.S. goods.  Also note a U.S. 
presentation in the IEM on trends in NSG denials, which 
illustrates, among other things, that denials to Iran are now 
the most frequent, and that the most commonly denied items to 
Iran are for centrifuge enrichment and other fuel cycle items. 
 
-- Urge other NSG PGs to make presentation and/or present 
papers on Iran,s nuclear program, as well as export control 
regulatory, implementation and enforcement measures taken to 
impede Iran,s nuclear procurement.

¶4. (U) BEGIN NONPAPER FOR ALL POSTS: 
 
-- The United States views the 2009 Nuclear Suppliers Group 
(NSG) Plenary week as an excellent opportunity to update all 
NSG Participating Governments on the status of Iran,s 
nuclear program and emphasize measures partners have taken to 
hinder Iranian procurement. 
 
-- We encourage your government to consider ways that you 
could help this effort and suggest that we all coordinate our 
Iran-related presentations and papers. 
 
-- For the upcoming Plenary in Budapest, the United States is 
preparing to do an Information Exchange Meeting (IEM) 
presentation on Uranium extraction from phosphates, as well 
as a Licensing and Enforcement Exports Meetings (LEEM) 
presentation on U.S. industry outreach efforts to prevent 
Iran from acquiring U.S. goods. 
 
-- The United States will also present a briefing at the IEM 
on trends in NSG denials. This briefing will illustrate, 
among other things, that denials to Iran are now the most 
frequent, and that the most commonly denied items to Iran are 
for centrifuge enrichment and other fuel cycle items. 
 
-- The United States encourages you to share your ideas on 
Iran - related briefings so that we can de-conflict topics. 
 
-- We suggest that PGs consider presentations and/or papers 
on various aspects of Iran,s nuclear program, Iranian 
deceptive procurement tactics, proliferation finance-related 
issues, Iranian procurement networks, designations of Iranian 
WMD related entities, export control regulatory actions taken 
(watch lists, etc.), industry outreach activities, and 
enforcement cases. 
 
FOR BERLIN, PARIS, LONDON and THE HAGUE: 
 
-- The United States suggests that a European Union member 
country consider a presentation on the actions the EU has 
taken to implement Iran specific export controls in the EU 
Common Position adopted pursuant to UNSCRS 1737 and 1803. 
 
-- This was a significant step that may help to encourage 
other Participating Governments adopt similar controls. 
 
FOR LONDON: 
 
-- The United States suggests that your government consider 
briefing the NSG LEEM on your &Iran List8 and any recent 
updates, as this will help encourage other countries to be 
vigilant about those entities.
