COMBAT NUCLEAR TERRORISM DELIVERED 
 
REF:  STATE 53043 
 
¶1.  (SBU) SUMMARY:  On May 27, EST Off delivered reftel demarche on 
strengthening the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism 
(GICNT) to Russia's MFA Department of Security and Disarmament 
Affairs First Secretary Olga Kuznetsova.  Kuznetsova said she was 
aware of some of the proposed enhancements, but several were new to 
her.  Although the MFA was ready to discuss any and all of the 
issues covered, Kuznetsova advised that it would be inappropriate to 
brief these ideas to the senior leadership at The Hague (June 15-17) 
until they had already been examined, discussed, and agreed to by 
"the experts."  END SUMMARY. 
 
TOPIC-BY-TOPIC COMMENTS 
----------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Kuznetsova offered the following specific comments: 
 
--  (SBU) Changes to the Implementation and Assessment Group (IAG): 
Kuznetsova agreed with the concept that the IAG should have a larger 
role and that it would be good to expand the IAG "in a flexible 
manner" to allow all who wanted to join to do so.  She opined that 
the Exercise Planning Group (EPG) already uses this model. 
 
--  (SBU) Creating a Secretariat:  Kuznetsova was surprised by this 
issue and said it had not been mentioned previously.  She queried 
how the United States and Russian Federation would retain 
oversight?"  While not hostile to the idea, she indicated this would 
require additional discussions to frame it in a way that could be 
clearly presented to the larger GICNT membership. 
 
--  (SBU) Clarifying the role of the EPG:  Her only comment was that 
this was a new item and that it would have to be carefully thought 
through. 
 
--  (SBU) Rotation of the Co-Chairs:  Again, she said this was a new 
item and one that would require careful consideration.  She allowed 
that this had been mentioned in passing at a previous GICNT session, 
but it had never been discussed.  When the retention of an "advisory 
role" for the U.S. and RF was mentioned, she asked whether this 
would "cause a problem as to who was the real policymaker?" 
 
--  (SBU) Expanding the Global Initiative Information Portal (GIIP): 
 Kuznetsova was in complete agreement regarding both the expansion 
of the GIIP and its use as a central collaboration mechanism. 
 
--  (SBU) Greater participation in the GICNT:  She said there was no 
disagreement on adding entities such as the INTERPOL and EUROPOL as 
observers.  She indicated that the addition of the United Nations 
Office of Drugs and Crime would have to be reviewed, as it had not 
been previously discussed, but did not see why it could not be added 
as well.  She said building a broader relationship that included the 
concept of academia and civil society organizations was fine, but 
that the number and type of these organizations would require 
discussion and study. 
 
--  (SBU) Capacity building mechanism:  Kuznetsova stated that 
formalizing the methodology for members to request assistance, 
expertise, etc., "made sense" to her, but that it would require 
"further exploration by the experts" before any formal opinion could 
be rendered. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Kuznetsova concluded by saying "there is no driving need 
to have a decision at The Hague in June."  She stated it would be 
best to allow the experts to meet, possibly using the GIIP as a 
forum, to work out the final recommendations for the decision-makers 
to discuss. 
 
Comment 
------- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) One thing that was clear throughout the conversation - 
Russia values the GICNT, sees it as a success, but wants to be very 
careful about changing how it works.  Kuznetsova expressed concern 
that unless care is taken to ensure the smallest/poorest members 
don't feel marginalized because their lack of resources precludes 
them from assuming some of the new roles, a two-tiered GICNT could 
emerge.
