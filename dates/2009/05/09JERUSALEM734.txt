Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al-Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida lead with news of Israeli Minister of 
Interior Yeshay endorsing a decision on May 3 to, "confiscate 12,000 
acres of Palestinian land" near the Jerusalem area Maale Adumim 
settlement.  Papers note that the move is an attempt to absorb the 
Kidar settlement into Maale Adumim and build 6,000 additional 
settlement housing units.  Continuing weekend coverage, reports add 
that Palestinian land in the East Jerusalem neighborhoods of Bayt 
Hanina and Silwan has also recently been "confiscated" to "force" 
Palestinians out of the city.  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida quotes Palestinian 
Authority Official for Jerusalem Affairs Abdul Qadir commenting that 
the decision is "racist and reveals the true face of [Israeli 
Premier] Netanyahu's policy towards Palestinians."  Qadir added that 
the policy serves the interests of Israeli settlers and he urged the 
international community to intervene and stop confiscations. 
 
Al-Ayyam leads with and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Quds front page 
reports on Palestinian Authority President Abbas' visit to Jordan on 
May 3.  Abbas met with King Abdullah and discussed the need for 
coordinated efforts on the part of Arab countries to meet the 
challenges of the new Israeli Government.  According to a joint 
communiqu, the two leaders stressed their commitment to the 
two-state solution, a halt to settlements and house demolitions in 
the hopes of restarting negotiations between Israel and the 
Palestinians.  According to coverage, King Abdullah condemned 
Israeli measures against Palestinian residents of Jerusalem and 
against Jerusalem religious sites.  The two leaders also stressed 
that the international community must accept its responsibility to 
end the "siege" of Gaza and ensure the provision of medical and 
humanitarian assistance to Gazans and advance reconstruction 
efforts. 
 
All front pages note Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's willingness 
to withdraw from Ghajar village on the Israeli-Lebanese border in 
response to U.S. pressure to produce a good-will gesture toward the 
Lebanese government. 
 
Al-Quds runs front page coverage of Hamas leaders denying that 
Israel has threatened the group with force via Egyptian 
intermediaries.  Hamas spokesperson Barhum noted on May 3 that Hamas 
is committed to a truce with Israel, but also ready to face any 
Israeli attack.  Hamas leader Al-Masri asserted that armed 
resistance is the legitimate right of Palestinians in their efforts 
to end the Israeli occupation, according to the report. 
 
All front pages report that Khalid Misha'al has been reelected Hamas 
politbureau chief.  The new "Hamas cabinet" will include Mahmud 
Zahhar and four other members, reporting notes. 
 
All dailies report on the Arab League's next meeting on May 7 in 
Cairo where responses to "continuous, escalating Israeli measures 
and violations against Jerusalem and religious sites" will be 
discussed.  Director of the Arab League Secretary General's Office 
Yusif noted that Arab leaders will bring their concerns before the 
U.N. Security Council. 
 
Al-Ayyam's front page cites Israeli daily Yedioth Ahronoth in 
reporting that the U.S. intends to promote indirect talks between 
Syria and Israel as part of broader efforts to improve U.S-Syrian 
relations.  According to coverage, the indirect talks would run 
parallel to Palestinian-Israeli talks and support U.S. efforts to 
deal with the Iranian nuclear threat.  In related front page

coverage, Al-Ayyam cites the wires in reporting that U.S. Embassy 
Damascus denied reports that U.S. officials would visit Syria soon. 
 
 
All dailies report on a May 3rd reception in Ramallah hosted by the 
U.S. Consulate General, Jerusalem to honor Palestinian journalists 
on World Press Freedom Day.  The reception was attended by a large 
number of Palestinian journalists representing many local and 
international media outlets, according to coverage.  In her remarks, 
Public Affairs Officer Schweitzer-Bluhm, "saluted journalists for 
their professionalism and dedication and acknowledged their efforts 
to do their job despite all difficulties," reporting concludes.

Weekend Stories: 
----------------- 
Sunday, May 3: 
"Clinton:  We are working to convince Israel to reopen Gaza 
crossings and allow goods into the Strip," front page headlines in 
Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida announced.  Both papers quoted the 
Secretary extensively from her April 30 testimony before the Senate 
Appropriations Committee and noted that she, "acknowledged that the 
American administration is facing difficulties in transferring the 
$900 million that the U.S. pledged in support of Palestinians during 
the donors conference in Sharm Al Sheikh, because of a lack of 
guarantees that the funds will reach their intended recipients in 
the Gaza Strip."  Reporting also noted that Clinton stressed that 
the existence of a Palestinian government whose entire membership 
accepted Middle East Quartet conditions would make matters easier. 
Al Quds' front page ran the same news, but also highlighted reaction 
by Human Rights Watch. 
 
In related reporting, all front pages highlighted Israeli raids on 
May 2 that destroyed tunnels along the Egypt-Gaza border and killed 
two Palestinians.  The reporting follows May 2 coverage of 
additional Israeli raids on Gaza tunnels. 
 
Saturday, May 2: 
 
Al Hayat Al Jadida front paged news, "Susan Rice:  We hope to see a 
unified position at the May 11 meeting of the U.N. Security Council 
on support for the two-state solution."  Ambassador Rice added in an 
interview with London-based Al Hayat newspaper that Washington has 
not yet designated a representative for the meeting, according to 
coverage. 
 
Al Quds led with news of Israeli plans to build an "Eastern Ring 
Road" around the city of Jerusalem in the hopes of thereby 
preventing a future Palestinian capital in the city.  Reporting 
notes the issuance of demolition orders against 10 houses and the 
confiscation of 20 acres by Israeli authorities for that purpose. 
In other news, Al Quds' front page noted that "hopes for national 
reconciliation weaken following President Abbas' announcement to 
form an expanded government soon."  Reporting noted that Fatah and 
Hamas have postponed the fifth round of talks, without setting a new 
date. 
 
Al Ayyam and Al Hayat Al Jadida led with reports about U.N. calls on 
Israel to halt home demolitions, "in occupied Jerusalem."  The U.N. 
statement also highlighted that 60,000 Palestinians in East 
Jerusalem live in unlicensed buildings.  A recent report issued by 
UN-OCHA (Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) also 
highlighted that throughout the Palestinian Territories 3,000 
Palestinian homes are under threat of Israeli demolition, possibly 
 
JERUSALEM 00000734  003 OF 003 
 
 
uprooting whole villages.  The report also stated that, "while 
Palestinians face many obstacles in obtaining permits for building 
on 13% of East Jerusalem land, illegal construction in 
settlements... is flourishing."

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Al-Quds daily independent runs an editorial under the title, 
"Will Israel find itself in conflict with the world?" (05/04):  "The 
whole world, including the U.S. administration, which is known to be 
Israel's closest friend, opposes Israeli violations including 
settlements, land confiscation, and the siege.  Nonetheless, Israel 
insists on proceeding with these policies, particularly Netanyahu 
and Lieberman who don't even try to hide their intentions... Israel 
will have to change its policies or face certain conflict with the 
U.S." 
 
2) Omar Hilmi Al-Ghul opines in Al-Hayat Al-Jadida official daily 
under the title, "Is there truly press freedom?" (05/04):  "Since 
1993, May 3rd has been World Press Freedom Day honoring journalists 
... Journalists in the Palestinian Territories are exposed to two 
kinds of violations, the first from Israel including imprisonment, 
killings and the second from the deposed Hamas government in Gaza, 
including the closure of several media outlets and muzzling of 
journalists... We call on all active human rights groups to defend 
the U.N. convention of freedom of expression, and to protect 
journalists, but will they listen?"
