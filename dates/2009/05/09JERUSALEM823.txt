Main Stories: 
------------- 
All dailies lead with the swearing in of the new Palestinian 
Authority caretaker government on May 19 in Ramallah.  According to 
coverage, the new government is comprised of 20 ministers from 
Fatah, Fida, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine 
and independents.  Azzam Al-Ahmad, head of the Fatah parliamentary 
block, noted that the block will boycott the new government because 
they were not properly consulted during the formation process. 
Hamas spokesperson Barhum noted in a press conference on May 19 that 
the new government will increase the legal and constitutional chaos 
in the Palestinian Territories.  All papers run the names and 
portfolios of the new ministers. 
 
Al-Ayyam's front page runs separate coverage of comments by 
Palestinian Authority Premier Fayyad reassuring that, "the newly 
formed government will only serve as a transitional body until 
Palestinian factions can agree on a national consensus government to 
end the current state of division." Fayyad added that, "the 
formation of this government is not meant to hinder Palestinian 
national dialogue efforts... we will support Palestinian national 
dialogue efforts to reach agreement because our goal is to end the 
Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories," according to 
coverage. 
 
Al-Quds' front page cites Israeli daily Haaretz in coverage of the 
May 18 meeting between President Obama and Israeli Premier Netanyahu 
in Washington.  According to coverage, Obama announced his intention 
to propose a new peace initiative that will actively engage Arab 
countries, Israel and the Palestinian Authority.  According to the 
new initiative, the U.S. will encourage Arab countries to 
immediately normalize relations with Israel in exchange for an 
Israeli halt to all settlement activities. 
 
Al-Ayyam runs front page coverage citing wires of Secretary 
Clinton's May 19 Global press conference.  Clinton reiterated that 
she has asked Israeli Premier Netanyahu to halt settlement 
activities in the Palestinian Territories and added that, "President 
Obama was very clear about this."  Clinton also reiterated that the 
U.S. is serious about the two-state solution, noting that 
Palestinians deserve a state.  The Secretary also stressed U.S. 
commitment to the security of Israel. 
 
Al-Ayyam's front page cites Wafa in reporting on the Palestinian 
Authority's call on the U.S. to exert real pressure on Israel to 
pursue the two-state solution.  Palestinian Authority presidency 
spokesperson Abu Rudaynah noted that, "continued, encouraging 
statements by the U.S., prove that President Obama is serious about 
resolving the conflict in the region."  The spokesperson added, 
"Obama's statements should now be put into action." 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida front pages and Al-Ayyam runs inside coverage on 
a May 19 press conference held at an East Jerusalem protest tent in 
the neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah.  Several Palestinian dignitaries 
denounced a recent Jerusalem Municipality decision to evict two 
Palestinian families from the neighborhood.  The speakers at the 
press conference voiced their concern that the evictions could be 
the first step in an Israeli "scheme" to build 200 "settlement 
units" on the debris of demolished Palestinian homes. 
 
In local economic news, inside pages of the dailies report on the 
Bank of Palestine opening a new branch on the Birzeit University 
campus on May 19.  The opening ceremony was attended by the 
 
JERUSALEM 00000823  002 OF 002 
 
 
University President, Director of the Bank of Palestine and a 
representative of the Palestine Monetary Authority.  The branch will 
facilitate access to banking services for university students and 
employees. 
 
Al-Quds' inside page reports on a U.S. Consulate General economic 
delegation's visit to Hebron to meet with Hebron Mayor Al-Issili on 
May 19.  The delegation was briefed about the economic situation in 
the Governorate and difficulties caused by checkpoints and other 
restrictions on movement, reporting notes.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
1) Hani Habib opines in Al-Ayyam independent daily under the title, 
"Obama's map" (05/20):  "Obama's new map[plan] will probably take 
into account Israeli interests as understood by the Americans... In 
his plan, Obama will ask Arabs to make more concessions... 
normalization of relations with Israel before starting negotiations 
will be the most significant of these concessions, in contrast to 
the Arab Peace Initiative which calls for normalization after 
successful peace negotiations,...Obama's plan will seek to convince 
the Islamic world to become a partner in the process, and that, in 
order to become a partner, it must first normalize relations with 
Israel... Obama, who seemed at first to be very excited about the 
Arab Peace Initiative, as was his Secretary, has now ignored it 
completely, at least in public statements!" 
 
2) Hatim Abu Shaban, Palestinian Legislative Council member opines 
in Al-Quds independent daily under the tile, "Useless, endless 
dialogue, shame on you!"(05/20):  "One question should be asked 
here, if the next dialogue session in July fails, what would is the 
destiny of the Palestinian people in Gaza?  And the Palestinian 
cause, will we then resort to another war to destroy what is left of 
Gaza so that factions can finally draw the proper lesson? ... Don't 
you [Palestinian factions] realize that your people are fed up with 
this division and with your endless arguments?  You should be more 
responsible, think about the national interest not your own 
interests.  You should reach an agreement before it's too late."
