Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported on the trip to London of three 
confidants of PM Benjamin Netanyahu to hold talks with Special U.S. 
Middle East envoy George Mitchell, which are expected to focus on 
Iran and a looming clash over settlement construction.  The Post 
reported that DM Ehud Barak told reporters that Netanyahu's visit to 
Washington last week marked the beginning of the dialogue with the 
new U.S. administration, and that this dialogue would take time and 
be marked by "peaks and valleys."   The daily quoted one senior GOI 
official as sayng that Jerusalem felt that if it made clear to the 
Americans that it would remove outposts, not build new settlements, 
not expropriate any Palestinian land, and not give incentives to 
people to live in the settlements, then the Obama administration 
would not pressure Israel to stop any building beyond the Green 
Line, even for natural growth.  According to the official, this may, 
however, be "wishful thinking," as the U.S. is continuing to signal 
to Israel that its formulation of removing outposts won't be 
sufficient to stave off calls for a complete settlement freeze. 
 
All media, except the religious ones, led with the police disclosure 
that the man believed to have killed American-Israeli teen Dana 
Bennett is a suspected serial killer responsible for at least three 
other murders over the last 14 years -- and that he also worked for 
several years as a police informant planted in jail cells to get 
information from other prisoners. 
 
Major media reported that PM Benjamin Netanyahu canceled his trip to 
France and Italy, which was scheduled for next week.  The media 
cited assessments that the reason for the cancellation was the PMQs 
bureauQs concern that he would be subjected to criticism on his 
position on the two-state issue.  The media reported that 
NetanyahuQs bureau denied this, citing urgent matters. 
 
Leading media reported that last night police and Civil 
Administration forces destroyed two huts on an outpost -- Hill 18 
(Mitzpe Avihai), near the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.  In 
addition, a tent was removed from the Federman Farm in the city of 
Hebron.  Leading media reported that yesterday DM Barak told 
diplomatic correspondents: QA way must be found to clarify to the 
Americans that there is no direct connection between the outposts 
and Iran. 
 
The Jerusalem Post quoted an Israeli defense official as saying 
yesterday that negotiations with Hamas for Gilad ShalitQs release 
will start at Qsquare oneQ under the direction of the GOIQs new 
envoy, who will likely be Intelligence Affairs Minister Dan Meridor. 
 The newspaper also reported that Egyptian intelligence chief Omar 
Suleiman is considering deploying an Egyptian delegation to Gaza to 
serve as a direct intermediary between Israel and Hamas.  The 
delegation will also supervise an agreement between Hamas and Fatah 
if is reached. 
 
Major media reported that Jordan is up in arms over a bill proposed 
by Knesset Member Arieh Eldad (National Union), which calls for 
"creating two states on the two banks of the Jordan River, one for 
the Israelis and one for the Palestinians".   The bill is up for 
debate in the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.   The 
leading news Web site Ynet quoted Petra, Jordan's official news 
agency, as saying yesterday that Nasser Judeh, the countryQs FM, 
summoned the Israeli Ambassador to Amman and demanded the bill be 
withdrawn.  Judeh also took the opportunity to explain to the 
ambassador that Jordan "believes in establishing an independent and 
viable Palestinian state on Palestinian soil," a Jordanian Foreign 
Ministry statement was quoted as saying.  "This is a strategic 
Jordanian interest that comes in line with a two-state solution and 
the Arab peace initiative," the statement said.   A Knesset debate 
has already taken place on EldadQs proposal.  Israel Radio reported 
that in a preliminary vote, 53 Knesset members voted in favor of the 
proposal, including six Labor Knesset members and five from Kadima. 
Speaking on Israel Radio, President Shimon Peres angrily said that 
the Palestinian problem must be solved on Palestinian soil with the 
Palestinians. 
 
Leading media quoted Minister for Strategic Affairs Moshe Ya'alon 
said yesterday the two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian 
conflict has failed and that "such a process has no chance as long 
as Palestinians see it as enabling the eradication of Israel." 
Ya'alon's remarks came during a conference at the Knesset in which 
Likud MK Tzipi Hotovely and others discussed alternatives to the 
two-state path, which stands at the center of President Obama's 
Middle East program.   Hotovely said that the conference was 
intended to "strengthen the hand of the Prime Minister, returning 
from Washington after standing firm against President Obama."  Makor 
Rishon-Hatzofe stressed that Likud MKsQ message to Netanyahu is that 
he should not veer from the partyQs diplomatic line.  Ya'alon added 
that recently "Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said they would 
never recognize Israel as a Jewish state.  This reflects that the 
Palestinians are striving not for the 1967 borders, but for a state 
that would be created over Israel's destruction, from the Jordan 
River to the [Mediterranean] Sea.  This also explains why [Yasser] 
Arafat waged war against us in September 2000 -- to eliminate the 
two-state idea, which was about to reach fruition," he said. 
Interior Minister Eli Yishai (Shas) added that "Netanyahu's 
diplomatic line is appropriate and justified .... In the end, the 
Americans will understand us.  We must not beautify ourselves to win 
their affection." 
 
Major media quoted the Lebanese media as saying that last week 
Lebanese security services arrested a colonel in the Lebanese Army 
on suspicion of spying for Israel.  The newspaper also reported that 
the ruined main synagogue in central Beirut is due to be renovated 
in the coming weeks, after an agreement between various religious 
denominations and permission from the Lebanese government, planning 
authorities and even Hizbullah.  Several dozen Jews still living in 
Lebanon will fund the project, along with others in the Diaspora. 
 
HaQaretz reported that Likud ministers are holding secret talks with 
Kadima's Number 2, Knesset Member Shaul Mofaz, to probe whether he 
would be willing to split from the opposition faction and lead a 
group of six other Kadima lawmakers to Likud.  The newspaper quoted 
sources in Likud as saying that the disappointment of many senior 
Kadima figures over chairwoman MK Tzipi Livni's refusal to join the 
Netanyahu government might make the split a reality. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that yesterday IDF Chief of Staff Lt. 
Gen .Gabi Ashkenazi told the KnessetQs Foreign Affairs and Defense 
Committee that he is not optimistic regarding WashingtonQs efforts 
to talk to Tehran.  Leading media reported that Ashkenazi told the 
committee that the job of evacuating West Bank outposts should be 
delegated to police officers, not IDF soldiers.  Maariv quoted 
Ashkenazi as saying that Hamas is a restraining factor.  He also 
stated that there was an absolute IDF prohibition against beating 
West Bank civilians in the course of their arrest.  Ashkenazi's 
Knesset appearance follows testimony in military court by the 
commander of the Kfir infantry brigade, Col. Itai Virob, in which 
Virob justified hitting Palestinian prisoners under exceptional 
circumstances. The commander was testifying in the case of 1st Lt. 
Adam Malul of the Kfir infantry brigade, who was accused of hitting 
a Palestinian during an arrest on the West Bank. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that a Likud official told the daily on 
Monday that the QNakba LawQ was on its way back to the Cabinet for 
renewed debate rather than to the Knesset. 
 
The Jerusalem Post mentioned that former U.S. Ambassadors to Israel 
Sam Lewis, Martin Indyk, and Dan Kurtzer are Qfrequent flyersQ to 
the country.

¶I.  "Welcome to Realistan" 
 
Diplomatic correspondent Aluf Benn wrote in the independent, 
left-leaning Ha'aretz (5/27): Q[President ObamaQs] foreign policy is 
directed at a single goal: a strong America as the leader of a 
stable world order.  The key word in his lexicon is interests.... 
The realistic approach is the key to the meeting between Obama and 
Netanyahu.... Netanyahu has been quick to adapt to the new world; at 
the meeting of the Likud Knesset faction on Monday he explained that 
dealing with Iran is more important than preserving the outposts -- 
as Obama had explained to him: An outpost in exchange for [the 
Iranian nuclear reactor of] Natanz.  His colleagues reacted with 
anger, just as they responded to former prime minister Ariel Sharon 
when he told them the thought that it's possible to keep 3.5 million 
Palestinians under occupation is a bad thing for Israel.... If he 
continues like this, Netanyahu will have to find inner strength and 
political cunning like Sharon in the inevitable conflict with his 
Qnatural partnersQ on the right.  He's not there yet, and his 
crucial moment has not arrived.  But after his trips to Sharm 
el-Sheikh and Washington, even Netanyahu is beginning to hum the 
realist tune. 
 
II.  "World War III Has Started" 
Eytan Haber, veteran op-ed writer and assistant to the late prime 
minister Yitzhak Rabin, opined in the mass-circulation, pluralist 
Yediot Aharonot (5/27): QToday one has to be deaf, dumb, and blind 
in order not to understand that the nuclear bomb that exploded on 
Monday in North Korea also blew up on JerusalemQs No. 3 Kaplan 
Street, the seat of the Israeli Prime Minister; the North Koreans 
pay no heed to the Americans ... and Jerusalem still recites that 
QRoadmapQ and the evacuation of some outpost.  The world is evolving 
in front of our very eyes and Israeli parliamentarians explain with 
utter seriousness how the Americans will agree to the continuation 
of Israeli presence in places we occupy in Judea and Samaria [i.e. 
the West Bank].  On that occasion we might even evacuate some hut. 
 
 
III.  "Expand the West Bank Settlements" 
 
The ultra-Orthodox HamodiQa editorialized (5/27): QPrime Minister 
Benjamin Netanyahu should be encouraged for sharply rejecting the 
demand by the U.S. Secretary of State, Mrs. Clinton, that 
construction in Jewish communities in Judea and Samaria [i.e. the 
West Bank] be stopped -- even regarding apartments and rooms as a 
result of natural growth.... The Palestinians view construction in 
Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Jerusalem, as illegal.  The Arabs view our very 
existence in the land of our forefathers as QillegalQ..... At least 
outwardly, the three senior cabinet members -- the Prime Minister, 
the Defense Minister, and the Foreign Minister -- are endeavoring to 
conduct a joint policy.... Only a united, cemented government has a 
good chance to withstand the new winds blowing from the White 
House.

QLeave Iran to the Iranians " 
 
Chief Economic Editor and senior columnist Sever Plotker wrote in 
the mass-circulation, pluralist Yediot Aharonot (5/27): QA different 
vision of Iran, not as a one-dimensional fortress of fanatic 
conservatism, but as an evolving country, a country in 
political-social-cultural flux, is what characterized the statements 
of most of the people who participated in two symposiums that were 
held [this week] by the Center for Iranian Studies in Tel Aviv 
University.... I emerged from that conference with a sense of lack. 
As much as we know about Iran, we still donQt know enough.  It is an 
enormous country with a long and unique history of culture and 
regimes that is replete with surprises and reversals.  It is a shame 
that so many Israelis, said sadly Professor David Menashri, the 
Director of the Center for Iranian Studies, presumptuously believe 
they can solve what they refer to as the Iranian problem.  ThatQs 
nonsense. We are too few, too far away, too foreign.  The world is 
trying to influence and to change, but in the end only the Iranians 
themselves are going to be able to solve the Iranian problem.
