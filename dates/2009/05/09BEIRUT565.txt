SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1. (SBU) On Saturday My 9, 2009, a new anti-corruption movement, 
the "ebanese Youth Coalition against Corruption" (LYCAC was 
launched in Beirut. This coalition was launched by the Youth Civil 
Society & Leadership (YCSL) program as a joint initiative between 
the Lebanese Transparency Association (LTA) and the International 
Research and Exchange Board (IREX).  The program focuses on 
mobilizing youth activists to strengthen advocacy and 
anti-corruption movement. In addition to lobbying Lebanese 
institutions to implement anti-corruption reforms, the LYCAC is 
implementing 28 anti-corruption projects in 38 Lebanese villages 
involving 325 youths and with beneficiaries from across the country. 
The LYCAC action plan to enhance the role of youths and civil 
society in monitoring the State is a first initiative of its kind in 
Lebanon.  End summary. 
 
IREX AND LTA LAUNCH THE "LEBANESE YOUTH COALITION AGAINST 
CORRUPTION" AND WIN OFFICIAL SUPPORT 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) The International Research and Exchange Board (IREX) and the 
Lebanese Transparency Association (LTA) announced the launch of the 
"Lebanese Youth Coalition Against Corruption" (LYCAC).  (Note:  IREX 
is an international non-profit organization founded in 1968, to 
deliver cross-cutting programs and civil society development. LTA 
was established in 1999 as the Lebanon Chapter of Transparency 
International and is the first Lebanese anti-corruption NGO.  End 
Note.)  During the event, Peter Salloum, IREX Middle East Program 
Manager described the importance of this project in the Middle East. 
 The program, funded by the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of 
Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (DRL), aims to promote youth 
activist leaders to address corruption and bad governance. 
 
¶3. (U) The project mobilizes youth leaders and empowers them with 
resources and skills to combat inefficient and corrupt governance in 
Lebanon, while providing small grants to support projects that 
encourage transparency and bridge sectarian divides.  Nada Abdel 
Sattar, Head of the LYCAC Board of Trustees, said the movement will 
be a watchdog to fight corruption in the public sector and will 
foster youth capacity building to work towards a positive change in 
Lebanon.  Interior Minister Ziad Baroud read President Sleiman's 
statement to the group, in which Baroud highlighted the President's 
support for transparency and accountability.   The speeches were 
followed by presentations about the Youth Civil Society (YCS) 
project, which funds and implements 28 anti-corruption projects, 
totaling around $120,000, across different regions of Lebanon.  The 
purpose of the grants is to bridge sectarian divides by involving 
youth activists in violence-prone geographical areas to implement 
anti-corruption and good governance projects. 
 
FIRST LEBANESE ANTI-CORRUPTION 
PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN GOL AND CIVIL SOCIETY 
-------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) By launching LYCAC, LTA and IREX aim to ensure the 
self-sustainability of this initiative through young leaders from 
different religious backgrounds across the nation towards the public 
good.  The result of the project is the coalition, uniting local 
NGOs and including youth groups that participated in different 
Lebanese regions, by combating corruption and bridging divides.  The 
conference provided an opportunity for youth civil society leaders 
across the country to share experiences, best practices, and lessons 
learned, while examining priorities and establishing next steps for 
the coalition.  With the official support it has succeeded in 
receiving, the coalition is looking forward to play an active role 
of checks and balances with the public sector institutions.  This 
DRL-funded project will expire in February 2010; however, the 
coalition, in cooperation with IREX and LTA, is currently examining 
strategies for sustainability and will explore various funding 
possibilities. 
 
COMMENT 
------- 
¶5. (SBU) The initiative, emerging from the youth and targeting 
youth, is the first anti-corruption coalition movement of its kind 
in Lebanon.  The support that was expressed to this initiative from 
 
BEIRUT 00000565  002 OF 002 
 
 
the local population of different religious, political and sectarian 
backgrounds indicates a common will across the country to change the 
status-quo, and work towards good governance.  End Comment.
