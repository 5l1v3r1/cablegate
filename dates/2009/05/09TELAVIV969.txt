REF: STATE 43679 
 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) Deputy Director General 
(DG) for Economic Affairs Irit Ben Abba told EconCouns on 
April 30 that the MFA was reluctant to vote on Kosovo's 
application to join the World Bank and IMF since Israel does 
not recognize Kosovo and does not want to appear to give the 
appearance of recognizing it. However, later in the day, she 
notified him that Israel would participate in the vote by 
mailing in an abstention.  Michal Finkelstein, Senior Advisor 
to the Ministry of Finance DG, also confirmed this in a 
telcom with EconCouns.
