¶1.  (SBU) This report provides an update on developments in Brazil 
regarding the swine flu outbreak. 
 
NEW REPORTED CASES: 
 
¶2.  (SBU) As of May 13 the Brazilian Ministry of Health continues to 
report eight confirmed cases of the H1N1 flu in Brazil.  The eight 
cases are spread throughout five states: Sao Paulo (2 cases), Rio de 
Janeiro (3 cases), Minas Gerais (1 case), Santa Catarina (1), and 
Rio Grande do Sul (1).  The Ministry of Health is currently 
monitoring an additional 37 suspected cases. 
 
OTHER DEVELOPMENTS: 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Brazilian press reported that an American citizen was 
hospitalized in the State of Bahia with H1N1-like symptoms, and 
noted the individual is a 43 year old male who was visiting the city 
of Salvador, Bahia to do volunteer work with a church group.  The 
man arrived in Brazil on Wednesday, May 6, and began to experience 
flu-like symptoms a few days later.  On Sunday, May 10, he sought 
medical attention at a local hospital, where he was examined by 
Brazilian doctors and put into isolation.  Brazilian health 
officials informed the Consulate that today that his results came 
back negative for H1N1 and he's been released from hospital.  The 
Consular Agent in Salvador has been in touch with him and confirmed 
that he's doing well. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Two Brazilian news outlets are quoting Health Minister 
Jose Temporao as stating that Roche and GlaxoSmithKline would not be 
able to keep up with demand for Tamiflu and Relenza if the number of 
H1N1 cases were to escalate.  He, therefore, reportedly plans to 
have his Ministry ask for voluntary licensing of both drugs during 
the upcoming World Health Organization meeting.
