KEY POINTS 
---------- 
 
¶1.  (SBU) CAVEAT:  This message is based on a variety of 
sources, some more reliable than others.  We gather 
information from all sources and try to winnow the chaff from 
the wheat.  Some reports recirculate, gaining apparent 
momentum from repetition.  Some reports are based on rumors 
or garble fact.  Some reports are more or less easily 
verifiable; others are impossible to confirm at all. 
Overall, however, this message conveys as accurate a picture 
of the state of play here as we can give. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) CHAD REBELS REMAIN AS YESTERDAY:  As of morning May 
6, Chad rebel columns remain generally as they were yesterday 
(REF A) -- three or perhaps four columns of Chad rebels are 
strung out along the border from points SE of Abeche to the 
CAR/Sudan/Chad tri-border area, north and south of Goz Beida 
town.  They appear to continue to remain in static positions 
50-60 miles inide the border, while sending out small 
scouting patrols.  Rebel troop strength is still reportedly 
in the 1,500 - 2,000 range.  The Chadian National Army (ANT) 
estimates 135 rebel vehicles.  There was been no mass rebel 
movement since the columns entered Chad and assumed these 
locations some 36 hours earlier. 
 
¶3.  (SBU) CHAD MILITARY REACTION:  The Chadian military used 
its air assets to attack some of the rebel columns the 
evening of May 5.  Those assets are a total of four SU-25 
Frogfoot close air support aircraft, three MI-24 HIND attack 
helicopters and two MI-17 HIP helicopters.  The ANT remains 
in defensive positions around Goz Beida town.  The ANT has 
deployed additional forces eastward from Mongo in central 
Chad.  The ANT may have also deployed ground troops from 
Abeche to take up positions that would permit offensive 
operations against the most northernly of the rebel columns, 
perhaps near Abdi.  There has been no increase in activity or 
apparent apprehension at military and civilian intelligence 
headquarters in N'Djamena, although some offices seem to be 
at low strength, which may indicate that officers are 
employed elsewhere. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) MINURCAT:  MINURCAT SRSG Victor Angelo visited a 
quiet, half-empty Goz Beida May 5, without incident.  He 
noted that MINURCAT continues to provide a law enforcement 
presence in Goz Beida and the ANT is deployed outside the 
town.  He confirmed the absence of Chadian civilian and 
administrative personnel there, including police, gendarmes 
and DIS.  The UN continues on highest alert consonant with 
continued presence in Chad and has suspended all routine 
humanitarian assistance operations in Goz Beida and KouKou, 
four kilometers from Goz Beida. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) SUDANESE AMBASSADOR:  Sudanese Ambassador Abdallah 
al-Sheikh Nouredin spoke with Ambassador Nigro May 5, 
delivering the Government of Sudan (GOS) party line:  that 
Sudan was not responsible for recent Chad rebel movements 
into Chad; that this was a matter among Chadians; that Sudan 
was committed to the peace accord signed in Doha last week; 
and that Sudan was committed to the Dakar Process, including 
a meeting of the Contact Group in Khartoum (for which no date 
has been set).  Ambassador Nigro asked his Sudanese homologue 
if the GOS would prevent the Chad rebels from returning to 
sovereign Sudanese territory after these incursions, but 
received no answer. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) CAPITAL CALM:  The capital was calm May 6, although 
rumors proliferate.  Local and international media have 
picked up stories about events in the east and reports are 
being broadcast on local TV and radio stations.  Traffic in 
and out of town, including across the Chad-Cameroon border 
appears normal.

¶7.  (SBU) EMBASSY ACTIONS:  We and all our partners, both 
civilian and military, continue to follow this situation 
carefully.  We will report appropriately on the progress of 
the situation in eastern Chad.  We are reviewing emergency 
action procedures as a prudent precaution and are sharing 
information with our non-official resident AMCIT and LES 
communities, as appropriate.  We have scheduled a AMCIT 
warden meeting for May 7. 
 
¶8.  (U) Minimize considered.
