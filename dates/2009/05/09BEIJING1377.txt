FIFTH A (H1N1) CASE CONFIRMED 
----------------------------- 
 
¶1.  (U) China's Ministry of Health (MOH) notified Embassy Beijing on 
May 21 that the Beijing Health Bureau reported its second confirmed 
case of influenza A (H1N1) on May 20. This is the fifth confirmed 
cases on Mainland China. Hong Kong also has three confirmed cases of 
influenza A (H1N1). 
 
-- The fifth confirmed case, a 21-year old male and student at a 
Canadian university, is a Chinese national. He flew from Toronto to 
Beijing on flight AC031, arriving on the afternoon of May 16. After 
developing flu-like symptoms on May 19, he went to see a doctor and 
was then transferred to a designated hospital for testing and 
treatment. On May 20, Beijing CDC test results were positive for 
influenza A (H1N1) and were confirmed later in the day by China 
CDC's National Influenza Laboratory. 
 
STATUS OF AMCIT QUARANTINE CASES 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶2. (SBU) As of May 21, two American citizens are reported to be in 
quarantine throughout China. One AmCit is quarantined in Beijing at 
Ditan Hospital, and another is quarantined in Guangzhou. 
 
NEW H1N1 PROCEDURES REPORTEDLY REQUIRED OF DOMESTIC CARRIERS 
---------- --------------------------------------------- --- 
 
¶3. (SBU) Post has received and is in the process of confirming 
reports from the International Air Transport Association (IATA) that 
the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) has notified 
Chinese domestic carriers of new procedures for their flight crews. 
These measures require crews to deliver passenger manifests with 
seat numbers to local quarantine officials, perform passenger 
temperature checks with an infrared thermometer before landing, and 
follow certain procedures if an elevated temperature is found. If 
any passengers are suspected to have the A/H1N1 influenza, the new 
requirements make the airline responsible for transporting the 
passengers and their bags to designated locations. 
 
DECLINE IN LOCAL MEDIA ATTENTION 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) ConGen Shanghai noted that the Oriental Morning Post, which 
had previously been printing several special pages on H1N1, has had 
a sudden drop-off in its large-scale coverage of H1N1. Local media 
across China, as collected mission-wide on May 21, has seen a 
similar drop off in coverage H1N1.
