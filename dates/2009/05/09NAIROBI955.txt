SUBJECT: SOMALIA - MOGADISHU TENSE BUT CALM 
 
¶1.  Summary: Mogadishu remained calm on May 12 after continued 
fighting between Islamic extremists and the Transitional Federal 
Government (TFG) on May 11.  TFG officials tell us they retook some 
lost ground in two counterattacks late on May 11, but are still 
facing a considerable challenge from al-Shabaab and Hisbul Islami 
forces arrayed against them.  Hundreds have been displaced by the 
fighting.  The death toll has risen to over 70 killed and hundreds 
wounded.  TFG officials tell us they are optimistic they can prevail 
in the expected clashes that lie ahead.  End Summary 
 
¶2.  After a brief lull overnight May 10, clashes between 
Transitional Federal Government (TFG) forces and their allies, and 
Islamist extremists resumed on the afternoon of May 11.  Six more 
Somalis were killed and 16 wounded in the May 11 fighting, bringing 
the total since May 9 to over 70 killed and hundreds wounded.  A 
tenuous calm prevailed May 12, but TFG officials expected more 
fighting in the days ahead. 
 
¶3.  On May 12 National Security Minister Omar Hashi informed us that 
on May 11 government forces successfully re-occupied Ex-Control 
Afgoye -- a key intersection in the Deyninle district -- and the 
Fagah neighborhood in lower Yaqshid district, which the TFG had lost 
in earlier fighting.  Defense Minister Mohamed Abdi Mohamed "Ghandi" 
said that during yesterday's clashes extremist groups launched 
mortar attacks toward Villa Somalia, the presidential compound. 
Although none hit inside the compound, one round struck an adjacent 
military camp, wounding three TFG soldiers.  Minister Ghandi said 
the TFG was not responding to the Islamist's ineffectual mortar 
barrages to avoid contributing to civilian casualties.  He lamented 
the civilian casualties thus far, and accused extremists of 
shielding themselves with civilians. 
 
¶4.  Minister Ghandi, a former Alliance for the Re-Liberation of 
Somalia member, was disappointed with the performance of Union of 
Islamic Courts troops, some of whom defected from the TFG early in 
the fighting.  He praised the previous administration's remaining 
Ethiopian- and newly-arrived Ugandan-trained troops as capable and 
disciplined.  The Uganda-trained force was charged with guarding the 
neighborhood around Villa Somalia. 
 
¶5.  Our contacts report hundreds, perhaps thousands of civilians 
have fled the fighting, especially in the heavily affected 
Wardhigley and Yaqshid districts.  Media reports of 17,000 are 
likely inflated.  Many of the displaced had recently returned to 
their homes since the formation of the new government, Minister 
Hashi told us. 
 
¶6.  Minister Ghandi told us President Sharif has been leading 
meetings with security chiefs, clan elders and religious leaders in 
an effort to resolve the conflict.  Ghandi said Sharif and others 
were optimistic, but recognized the serious challenge facing them. 
 
 
¶7.  A weeklong Somali Islamic scholar's conference concluded on May 
11 in Mogadishu with a six point communique.  While condemning 
renewed violence in Mogadishu, the scholars declared the TFG an 
"Islamic" government and called on both sides to cease fire.  The 
Puntland government also called for an end to hostilities, terming 
Mogadishu "the capital of Somalia."  The Puntland administration 
called for broad-based consultation with and by all stakeholders to 
study and resolve the crisis. 
 
¶8.  At a press conference May 12 in Mogadishu, Hussien Fidow, an 
al-Shabaab spokesman denied President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed's 
statement that the TFG is protecting civilians.  Fidow said TFG is 
protecting Uganda and Burundi forces.  Fidow also dismissed the 
council of Islamic Scholars as a conference of "TFG apologists."  In 
yet another admission of the presence of foreign jihadist elements 
with al-Shabaab, Fidow it was irrelevant  that the "selfless 
mujahidin brothers" who sacrificed their life to aid Somalis were 
"foreigners". "They are our Mujahidin brothers" said Fidow.
