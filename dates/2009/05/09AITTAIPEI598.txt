SUBJECT: MEDIA REACTION: U.S. TORTURE OF DETAINEES 
 
Summary:  Taiwan's major Chinese-language dailies focused news 
coverage May 19 on Taiwan Minister of Health Yeh Ching-chuan's 
attendance at the World Health Assembly in Geneva Monday, which was 
Taiwan's first time participating in 38 years; on the conclusion of 
the DPP's 24-hour sit-in in front of the Presidential Office; and on 
reviews of President Ma Ying-jeou and his administration's 
performance one year after assuming office.  Regarding editorials 
and commentaries, an op-ed in the conservative, pro-unification, 
English-language "China Post" said that the torture of prisoners is 
a political as well as a moral mistake.  However, United States 
President Barack Obama failed to provide justification when he 
decided not to release more photos showing prisoner abuse, the op-ed 
criticized.  End summary. 
 
"War, Torture, Morality and the Law" 
 
Arthur I. Cyr, Clausen Distinguished Professor at Carthage College, 
opined in the conservative, pro-unification, English-language "China 
Post" [circulation: 30,000] (5/19): 
 
"... If clarity of commitment by Bush and Rumsfeld to torture was 
undeniable, though described with linguistic legerdemain, the Obama 
administration so far has been awkwardly ambivalent.  After 
releasing classified details about Bush administration discussions, 
the White House has now backed off releasing graphic, gross photos 
of prisoners held in U.S. custody.  Reportedly, CIA Director Leon 
Panetta and other officials have strenuously opposed the release of 
this classified information. 
 
"Obama has yet to provide persuasive justification for his fitful 
footsteps.  A brilliant presidential candidate, in this matter he 
has not demonstrated presidential leadership."
