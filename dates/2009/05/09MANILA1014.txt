¶1. (SBU) In a letter dated April 29, 2009 the Philippine Secretary 
for Transportation and Communications expressed gratitude for the 
U.S. assistance to a Philippine ship that Somali pirates released on 
April 21 (text in para 2).  There are currently more than 80 
Filipino seafarers held hostage by Somali pirates on board seven 
vessels.  The fate of the seafarers remains an issue of deep public 
concern in the Philippines.  In the instant case, soon after its 
release, the Philippine ship ran out of fuel off the eastern coast 
of Somalia.  The United States Navy refueled the drifting ship, 
provided food and water for the crew, and escorted it to safety. 
 
 
¶2. (SBU) Begin text of the letter: 
 
Dear Secretary LaHood, 
 
It is my pleasure to have met personally this morning Ms. Susan 
McDermott, Acting Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International 
Affairs and the rest of the members of the American delegation on 
the occasion of the Opening Day of the 6th APEC Transportation 
Ministerial Meeting in Manila from 27-29 April 2009.  I am happy to 
see them here because the United States has been an important 
partner in advancing the work of the transportation sector in the 
APEC process. 
 
I write to personally thank you and the American government for 
providing naval escort through the US Navy Ship, "T193- WALTERS' 
DEIHL" and her crew for the Philippine registered chemical tanker, 
"MT STOLT STRENGTH" together with her 23 Filipino seafarers, 
following her release from the hands of the Somali pirates on 21 
April 2009.  They were held in captivity for more than five (5) 
months. 
 
Aside from providing naval escort within Somali waters, US naval 
ship "T193-WALTERS' DEIHL" also supplied "MT STOLT STRENGTH" with 
diesel and food and water for the crew.  I personally thank you for 
all this great help and assistance. 
 
As of 7:20 am today, MT STOLT STRENGTH" safely arrived in Salalah, 
Oman.  Her crew will take their flight back to the Philippines in a 
few days. 
 
Once again, thank you and I wish to reassure you and your Department 
of our continuing cooperation on issues of common and mutual 
interest. 
 
(Signature)
