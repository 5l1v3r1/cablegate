¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY: The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) today 
confirmed another case of A/H1N1 Influenza in Germany, 
increasing the total number of confirmed cases to twelve.  One 
woman from Bavaria tested positive for H1N1 after returning 
from Mexico.  RKI reports a mild course of the virus in 
Germany.  END SUMMARY. 
 
 
Seventh Case of H1N1 in Bavaria 
------------------------------- 
¶2. (SBU) The National Reference Center for Influenza at the 
Robert Koch Institute (RKI) announced in its morning press 
briefing May 11 another laboratory-confirmed case of H1N1 for 
Germany.  This increases the total number of confirmed cases 
in Germany to twelve (Refs A,B,C,D,E). 
 
¶3. (SBU) A 27 year old woman from the Main-Spessart district 
in Lower Franconia (Bavaria) tested positive for H1N1 after 
returning from a trip to Mexico.  RKI report that the woman 
stayed in Mexico for several weeks where she cared for 
patients with respiratory problems at a hospital.  Media 
report that the woman had no fever or major problems when she 
returned to Germany.  Although health official report she has 
already full recovered from the virus, she has been isolated 
at home as a precautionary measure.  This is the seventh 
confirmed case of A/H1N1 for the federal state of Bavaria 
(other Bavarian cases reported in Refs A,D,E). 
 
 
Mild cases of H1N1 in Germany 
---------------------------- 
¶4. (SBU) RKI reported today that none of the A/H1N1 cases in 
Germany are considered serious.  The course of the virus has 
been mild in all twelve confirmed cases.  There is no 
"immediate threat" for the population, said RKI. 
 
 
German Infected in the U.S. traveled to Arizona 
--------------------------------------------- -- 
¶5. (SBU)  As reported in Ref A, a man from Bavaria tested 
positive for H1N1 after returning from the U.S., the eleventh 
confirmed virus case for Germany.  ConGen Munich's Post 
medical advisor Dr. Nikolaus Fruehwein spoke to the Bavarian 
Ministry of Health and subsequently informed ConGen Munich 
that the case likely came from Arizona. 
 
¶6. (SBU) According to Fruehwein the Bavarian Ministry of 
Health is discussing what vaccine to pursue for the fall - the 
normal "seasonal" flu vaccine or one for H1N1.  A 
"tetravalent" vaccine with both antibodies in it would not be 
possible since the H1N1 is "different" from the other flu 
strains.  He said the incidence of H1N1 cases is decreasing 
going down.  If there is to be a second wave, it would occur 
within four to six weeks.  In general, Fruehwein was 
"optimistic" that there would be no "second wave."
