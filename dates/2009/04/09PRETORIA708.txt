ECONOMIC STATISTICS 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  South Africa did not escape the negative 
consequences of the international financial turmoil, despite the 
fact that its domestic financial institutions had virtually no 
direct exposure to the troubled assets that were central to the 
deterioration of credit markets.  Deteriorating consumer and 
business confidence, declining global demand, and a relatively tight 
domestic monetary policy were reflected in the contraction in real 
GDP in the fourth courter of 2008.  However, declining domestic 
inflation together with weakening domestic and international demand 
allowed the South African Reserve Bank's Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC) to reduce interest rates by 250 basis points since December 
¶2008.  To bolster confidence and combat the negative impact of the 
slowdown, the SAG announced an expansionary budget which provides 
for a deficit of 3.9 percent of GDP in FY2010.  South Africa's 
current account deficit narrowed to 5.3 percent of GDP in the fourth 
quarter of 2008, as weaker merchandise exports were more than 
countered by a contraction in the value of merchandise imports and 
lower dividend payments to non-resident investors.  A combination of 
direct and other investment inflows financed the current account 
deficit in the fourth quarter, while portfolio investment recorded a 
record outflow.  The outflow was due to the sell-off of domestic 
securities following the uncertainty in global financial markets 
surrounding the magnitude of credit losses in the developed 
economies.  The outflow of portfolio investments and the reduction 
in commodity prices resulted in a significant depreciation in the 
rand during the fourth quarter of 2008.  The rand continued to 
fluctuate at these lower levels during the first quarter of 2009. 
End Summary.

Comment: The rand depreciated by 31.5 percent against the dollar and 
25.2 percent against the trade-weighted average exchange rate of the 
rand in 2008.  The sharp decline in the exchange rate was caused by 
global financial turmoil, with investors rechanneling funds to 
familiar, mature markets, as well as by the drop in international 
commodity prices, which constitute a large percentage of South 
Qcommodity prices, which constitute a large percentage of South 
Africa's exports.  The rand stabilized at around R10/$ on average 
during the first quarter of 2009.  End Comment.

PPI      14.5     12.6     11.0     9.2     7.3 
 
Comment:  The collapse in international commodity prices as well as 
weak global and domestic demand started to slow the upward inflation 
spiral.  The Monetary Policy Committee's (MPC's) most recent central 
inflation forecast projects that inflation will continue its 
downward trajectory and return to within the 3-6 percent target 
range in the third quarter of 2009.  Inflation is then forecast to 
increase again and to breach the upper end of the target range in 
the first quarter of 2010, mainly as a result of technical base 
 
PRETORIA 00000708  002 OF 007 
 
 
effects.  Thereafter, inflation is expected to return to within the 
target range and remain there until the end of 2010.  Inflation is 
expected to average 6.5 percent and 5.3 percent in 2009 and 2010, 
respectively.  In January 2009, StatsSA introduced a new headline 
consumer price index, the CPI for all urban areas, which replaced 
CPIX as the inflation target measure.  Four fundamental changes 
encapsulate the new consumer price inflation measure.  First, the 
replacement of the International Trade Classification with the 
Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP), which 
is the international norm for the classification of goods and 
services measured in the CPI.  Second, the reweighting of the CPI 
with new expenditure weights primarily based on the Income and 
Expenditure Survey (IES) of 2005/06.  Third, the rebasing of the CPI 
to the 2008 calendar year.  Fourth, the introduction of owners' 
equivalent rent to estimate housing-related costs.  End Comment.

Rate 
 
Comment:  The South African Reserve Bank's Monetary Policy Committee 
(MPC) reduced the key policy interest rate, the repo rate, by a 
cumulative 250 basis points since December 2008.  The rate cuts were 
made possible by declining domestic inflation and weakening domestic 
and international demand.  Most analysts believe there will be 
further interest rate cuts in 2009.  End Comment.

(1) Total After Adjustments (year-to-date) 
 
Comment:  Weaker global demand coupled with declining international 
commodity prices compressed the export earnings of South African 
producers since the fourth quarter of 2008.  The slowdown in foreign 
demand caused the total volume of both mining and manufactured goods 
exports to decrease.  In addition to the general slowdown in global 
demand, exports of South African goods were also affected by the 
tightening of global lending criteria which, in some instances, 
 
PRETORIA 00000708  003 OF 007 
 
 
forced producers in the mining and manufacturing sectors to scale 
down production, reschedule expansion projects and retrench 
employees.  However, exporters received some support from a weaker 
rand, which improved their price competitiveness in international 
markets.  Merchandise imports were weighed down by the subdued 
domestic demand for both capital and consumer goods.  End Comment.

Comment:  South Africa's gross gold and foreign reserves decreased 
slightly in January, caused mainly by valuation changes rather than 
outflows.  In March, the SARB used the opportunity of a weaker rand, 
in the second half of the month, to boost the reserves through its 
foreign exchange operations.  South Africa's net reserves have risen 
over the past five years, after the SARB eliminated its loss-making 
forward foreign exchange book in 2004.  End Comment.

Comment: Deteriorating consumer and business confidence, declining 
global demand, and a relatively tight domestic monetary policy were 
reflected in the contraction in real GDP in the fourth quarter of 
¶2008.  The decline could mainly be attributed to a pronounced 
deterioration in real value in the secondary sector, particularly 
manufacturing. 
 
Primary sector:  The strong growth in economic activity in the 
primary sector in the fourth quarter was largely the result of 
increased agricultural production.  Output in the agricultural 
sector benefited from an increase in the production of field crops, 
particularly corn, where the crop harvested increased from 7.1 
million tons in the 2006/07 production year to 12.7 million tons in 
the 2007/08 production year.  The mining sector showed positive 
growth in the fourth quarter, following a decline in the third 
quarter.  This turnaround was underpinned by improved production at 
the platinum and gold mines. 
 
Secondary sector:  Growth in the secondary sector turned negative 
QSecondary sector:  Growth in the secondary sector turned negative 
since the third quarter, mainly due to a decline in manufacturing 
output.  The decline in manufacturing was mainly evident in the 
subsectors that manufacture petroleum products, chemicals, rubber 
and plastic products; basic iron and steel products; and motor 
vehicles, parts and accessories.  These developments were a 
reflection of the strained export market for manufactured goods and 
the concurrent impact of households' weaker demand for durable 
consumer goods.  The contraction in the real value added by the 
electricity, gas and water sector in the fourth quarter was largely 
due to a decline in the output of electricity, which reflected the 
faltering domestic demand and the fact that energy-intensive smelter 
operations were terminated on account of the weaker export demand 
 
PRETORIA 00000708  004 OF 007 
 
 
for South African commodities.  The construction sector remained 
buoyant in the fourth quarter, benefiting from the upgrading of 
existing infrastructure and large projects such as the Gautrain, 
power stations, roads, sport stadiums and related infrastructure 
developments for the 2010 FIFA World Cup under construction. 
 
Tertiary sector:  The slower pace of growth in the tertiary sector 
reflected a slowdown in the trade sector.  This sector is in a 
technical recession following negative growth in the second, third, 
and fourth quarters, caused in part by the weakness in trade 
volumes, exacerbated by the global crisis, subdued real income, and 
higher interest rates that consequently dampened demand.  Some of 
the fiercest headwinds were faced by the motor trade subsector, 
where total new vehicle sales declined by roughly 143,000 units, or 
21.1 percent, in 2008.  This was the lowest level of annual sales 
since 2004.  The slower growth in the transport and communication 
sector in the fourth quarter was the result of decreasing volumes of 
merchandise imports and exports.  End Comment.

(percentage) 
 
Comment: South Africa's current account deficit narrowed to 5.3 
percent of GDP in the fourth quarter of 2008, influenced by 
developments in the global economy.  With global demand waning, the 
volume of merchandise exports contracted noticeably in the fourth 
quarter of 2008, while at the same time the prices of most export 
commodities declined.  The weakening of the export performance was 
more than countered by a contraction in the value of imports due to 
a substantial drop in the international price of crude oil and a 
moderation in the domestic demand for imported manufactured goods. 
The current account was further supported by lower dividend payments 
accruing to non-resident investors on their investments in domestic 
securities.  Some key South African companies have already announced 
no dividend payments in 2009, which could lead to a further decline 
in income payments on the balance of payments, and a further 
narrowing of the current account deficit.  End Comment.

--------------------------------------------- -------- 
 
Comment:  The inflow of foreign direct investment in the fourth 
quarter can mainly be attributed to the acquisition of equity in 
South African companies by non-resident investors, which more than 
offset a reduction of South African subsidiaries' long-and 
short-term loan liabilities against overseas parent companies. 
Foreign portfolio investment registered a record quarterly outflow 
of capital in the fourth quarter as non-resident investors continued 
to reduce their holdings of South African equity and debt 
securities.  The sell-off of domestic securities followed the 
uncertainty in global financial markets surrounding the magnitude of 
credit losses in the developed economies.  Other investment flows 
consisted mainly of short-term foreign loans drawn upon by South 
African banks, as well as non-resident investors' foreign-currency 
denominated deposits with these banks.  End Comment.

Comment:  Deteriorating consumer and business confidence due to the 
relatively tight domestic monetary policy, energy supply 
constraints, and declining global demand were reflected in the 
slower growth rate in 2008.  Economists expect growth to slow 
further in 2009 on the back of the global slowdown.  Some economists 
predict a contraction in GDP of between 0.5 and 1 percent in 2009. 
This would be the first contraction in GDP since 1992.  End

Comment:  The national savings ratio, measured by expressing gross 
saving as a percentage of GDP, increased further in 2008.  This was 
due to an improved saving performance of the corporate sector, while 
households' gross savings underpinned the national savings ratio 
further.  The increase in corporate savings can be attributed to an 
increase in the gross operating surpluses of business enterprises 
and a decline in dividend payments in the final quarter of 2008. 
Gross saving by the general government turned negative in 2008 due 
to lower tax revenue in response to the subdued economic climate. 
The improvement in the savings performance in 2008 lowered South 
Africa's dependency on foreign capital to finance gross capital 
formation.  Investment programs by private business enterprises, 
public corporations, and the general government boosted growth in 
gross capital formation in 2008.  The ratio of gross capital 
formation to GDP increased to its highest level since 1985 and is 
approaching the SAG's target of 25 percent.  End Comment

Comment:  The impact of the weak domestic demand and the global 
economic crisis on tax revenues are primarily to blame for the 
change in fiscal stance in 2009.  However, analysts warned that the 
effect of the global crisis on company profits has not yet been 
fully reflected in the 2009 revenue numbers.  Analysts expect 
corporate tax payments to deteriorate further in the 2010 fiscal 
year, especially since sectors such as manufacturing and mining, 
which have been savaged by the global downturn, loom large in 
corporate tax take.  The fiscal deficit is expected to increase to 
3.9 percent of GDP in 2010.  End Comment.

Comment: The SAG continued to finance its borrowing needs from 
domestic sources.  The decline in government debt as a percentage of 
GDP can be attributed to the rapid growth of the economy and the 
creation of fiscal surpluses in FY 2007 and FY 2008. However, total 
debt is set to increase to 31.1 percent of GDP in FY 2012 to finance 
the projected budget deficits over the next three years.  Debt 
service costs have shown a steadily declining trend since peaking at 
Qservice costs have shown a steadily declining trend since peaking at 
5.6 percent of GDP in the 1999 fiscal year.  The decline in debt 
service costs has created the necessary "fiscal space" to finance 
social priorities.  Despite the projected increase in total debt 
over the next three years, debt servicing cost is set to remain 
stable at about 2.5 percent of GDP.  National Treasury attributed 
this to lower interest rates and active debt swap and refinancing 
programs.  End Comment.
