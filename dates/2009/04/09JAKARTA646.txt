PARLIAMENTARIAN VOICES SUPPORT 
 
REF: 08 JAKARTA 924 
 
¶1.  (U) SUMMARY:  A ranking member of the Indonesian 
Parliament (DPR) has written to President Yudhoyono urging 
that the U.S. Naval Medical Unit (NAMRU-2) return to full 
operation and that negotiations resume on a new memorandum of 
understanding.  A translation of the letter appears below. 
The letter was also released to the press, receiving local 
coverage.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (U) The NAMRU-2 facility has received some much-needed 
public support.  H. Soltardjo Soerjogoeritno, who is a Deputy 
Speaker of the Indonesian legislature (DPR) and a senior 
member of the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle 
(PDI-P), wrote to President Yudhoyono on the matter on 
February 19. 
 
¶3.  (U) The letter requested that the GOI resume negotiations 
with the United States on a memorandum of understanding 
(MOU), that normal research and training continue during the 
negotiations, and that the GOI extend residence and work 
permits for U.S. NAMRU staff until alternate conditions were 
agreed between the two sides.  Soerjogoeritno is a member of 
DPR's Commission I, which handles foreign and security 
affairs.  He sent the letter after meeting with Indonesian 
research staff employed at NAMRU. 
 
¶4.  (U) The letter, which was sent to the press and received 
local coverage, is apparently the first letter from a DPR 
member to the GOI regarding NAMRU's status since DPR hearings 
on NAMRU in June 2008 and the first one to take a position on 
efforts by the Minister of Health to restrict NAMRU's 
activities.  A group of DPR deputies visited NAMRU shortly 
before the hearings. 
 
¶5.  (U) Bio Note:  Soerjogoeritno was born in Klaten, Central 
Java, in 1934, and has represented Sleman and Yogyakarta in 
that region.  He has been a member of the PDI-P since 1950, 
joining the party's leadership in 1964. 
 
¶6.  (U) The following is Mission's informal translation of 
the Indonesian text of the letter.

RE: Cooperation Republic of Indonesia-NAMRU 2 
 
Jakarta, 19 February 2009 
 
His Excellency, President of the Republic of Indonesia: 
 
We hereby inform you that DPR Commission I on February 5, 
2009 met with the Indonesian Employees Association of 
NAMRU-2.  During the meeting, the association provided 
information concerning the cessation of various researches 
and activities of NAMRU-2 projects, which has (negatively) 
affected the development of research in health sector as well 
as the further employment status of Indonesia research 
personnel at NAMRU-2. 
 
In regard to this matter, the DPR requests the attention of 
Government for the following issues: 
 
¶1.  That the government hasten the conclusion of MOU 
negotiation of NAMRU-2 on the basis of the principle of 
mutual benefit and seal any cracks that could potentially 
damage the national interest of Indonesia; 
 
¶2.  That during the negotiations, the activity of NAMRU-2, 
especially in the health research/training sector, continue 
in order to develop and increase the professionalism of 
Indonesian researchers; 
 
¶3.  That the government, to wit, the Department of Foreign 
Affairs, extend residence and work permits for U.S. 
researchers at NAMRU-2 until alternate provisions emerge from 
the MOU negotiations. 
 
We hope government can immediately undertake these actions. 
 
Thank you for your attention.
