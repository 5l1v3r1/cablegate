seeks U.S. high level participation in the GICNT seminar it 
plans to host in Rabat June 3-5 and requests information on 
the make-up of the U.S. delegations to both the Rabat and The

¶2.  (SBU) Dutch PolOff Dirk Klaasen delivered his country's 
invitation requesting Morocco's participation in the 5th 
Global Initiative To Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) plenary 
meeting to Ministry of Foreign Affairs Director of United 
Nations Division Azzedine Farhane on April 21.  Klaasen

¶3.  (SBU) Farhane accepted the invitation and said that 
Morocco is looking forward to participate in the event at The 
Hague on June 16-17, 2009.  MFA Secretary General Youssef 
Amrani plus five or six other members will likely make up the 
Moroccan delegation.  Farhane agreed that Morocco will give a 
10-15 minute presentation on either the topic "efforts to 
deny terrorist safe haven" or "efforts to deter terrorist 
intentions to acquire and use nuclear devices" during the 
afternoon session of June 16.  Farhane must consult with 
others before committing on the precise topic and will make 
every effort to inform the Embassy before April 30.  Farhane 
asked who would represent the United States at the plenary 
meeting in the Netherlands. 
 
-------------------------- 
New Members to Join GICNT? 
-------------------------- 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Referring to President Obama's April 5 nuclear 
weapons speech delivered in Prague, Farhane asked if there 
were any potential new member countries asking to be a part 
of the GICNT.  He suggested that new members may be 
considered during the June plenary session at The Hague and 
would like for GICNT co-chairs Russia and the United States 
to share news of potential newcomers with current members. 
Farhane opined that the Obama administration seems open to 
work with new partners and Morocco is eager to hear more.

Morocco Requests U.S. Support for Rabat Conference 
--------------------------------------------- ----- 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Morocco is moving forward with its plans to host a 
GICNT Seminar in Rabat June 3-5, 2009 on the topic 
"preventing illicit trafficking in nuclear and radioactive 
materials".  MFA Secretary General Youssef Amrani will open 
the event and Morocco would like to know who will represent 
the United States.  Morocco would like for someone at the 
Undersecretary level to participate and would also like to 
have the U.S. commit to give a presentation of its choice at 
the Rabat meeting in June.  Previous messages were sent 
requesting this information but Morocco has received no 
response.  Farhane shared that just as the United States and 
Russia would like for Morocco to participate in the plenary 
session at The Hague to make it a success, Morocco would like 
the same participation and commitment to the Rabat meeting 
from GICNT Co-chairs Russia and the United States and plenary 
host the Netherlands. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) In addition to the June GICNT Seminar in Rabat, 
Morocco also plans to host an outreach meeting for West 
Africa, now scheduled for sometime in 2010.  Farhane 
suggested that Morocco may plan to organize some GICNT 
exercises after 2010. 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Comment: Post would appreciate Department guidance 
on any possible presentation the USG can provide at the Rabat 
GICNT conference and any information on the lead and makeup 
of the U.S. delegation for passage to the Moroccan MFA.  Post 
 
also seeks information on the lead and makeup of the U.S. 
delegation to the GICNT plenary session in the Netherlands as 
well as any details about possible new members joining the 
GICNT group.
