ANC Official Arrested in Abalone Bust 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶1. (U) ANC Western Cape Regional Treasurer Simphiwe Kalolo was 
arrested in Hermanus with nearly 2500 kg of illegal abalone in his 
possession.  South African Police service (SAPS) Senior 
Superintendent Pindelwa Mayakala said the SAPS Marine Unit spotted 
Kalolo early Sunday morning driving a car plastered with ANC 
stickers and a poster of Jacob Zuma.  When they tried to arrest him, 
he fled.  The estimated street value of the confiscated abalone is R 
329,000 ($32,000).  Media reports say Kalolo has a reputation as a 
"well-heeled party animal, who wore brand names clothes and had lots 
of girlfriends."  Kalolo earned R 30,000 ($3,000) monthly as a 
strategic advisor to the Overberg District Mayor, but was fired 
after his arrest. 
 
¶2. (U) ANC Regional Secretary Latola Henricks confirmed that Kalolo 
was the ANC Regional Treasurer and said he would keep his ANC 
position until after the trial.  Abalone poaching is rampant in the 
area.  Many young men from informal settlement are divers, often 
swimming to far-off Dyer Island where abalone is easier to find. 
Police say the abalone is sold for drugs to traders who sell it to 
Chinese triads.  One poacher was surprised Kalolo had the abalone on 
his car seat.  He said, "You don't know when you are going to get to 
a roadblock and that is why poachers usually keep poached abalone in 
the trunk." 
 
----------------------------------------- 
SADC Skipper Fined R1.5M for Shark-Fining 
----------------------------------------- 
 
¶3. (U) The skipper of a Taiwanese vessel was fined R1.5 million when 
1.6 tons of dried shark fins were discovered on the vessel after it 
docked in Cape Town harbor in March 2009.  Department of 
Environmental and Tourism Affairs (DEAT) officials said this was the 
largest fine ever imposed for fishing permit violations and that the 
1.6 tons was the largest amount of illegal shark fins ever seized in 
South Africa.  DEAT officials noted that the amount of dried shark 
fins aboard the ship indicated it had captured at least thirty tons 
of sharks, nearly fifteen times what the crew claims to have caught. 
 DEAT officials said the vessel would be blacklisted internationally 
and the captain would be charged with a criminal offense.  TRAFFIC 
Africa Senior Program Officer Markus Burgener welcomed the fine, 
noting that a recent TRAFFIC report said shark fining results in an 
unsustainable level of shark killing.  Shark fins are estimated to 
be worth between $400-700 per kilogram. 
Qbe worth between $400-700 per kilogram. 
 
--------------------------------------- 
Regional Fisheries Enforcement Exercise 
- A Huge Success 
--------------------------------------- 
 
 
PRETORIA 00000872  002.3 OF 004 
 
 
 
¶4. (U) South Africa, Kenya, Mozambique and Tanzania fisheries 
inspectors held a 31-day sea patrol exercise along Africa's eastern 
coast aboard South Africa's environmental enforcement vessel Sarah 
Baartman from February to March.  The goal was to improve and 
strengthen fisheries surveillance and law enforcement in the SADC 
region.  DEAT officials reported that inspectors arrested six 
vessels and inspected 40 others.  One seizure along the Tanzanian 
coast resulted in the recovery of more than 290 tons of 
illegally-harvested blue fin tuna.  The inspectors arrested two 
South African hake hand-line vessels off Mossel Bay, and a prawn 
fishing boat off the Mozambique coast. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Western Cape to Encourage Aquaculture 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶5. (U) The Western Cape Provincial government has introduced a new 
aquaculture strategy establishing aquaculture development zones 
where fish farms will be concentrated.  There are currently 
fifty-nine aquaculture farms, producing primarily abalone, trout, 
freshwater crayfish, oysters, mussels and seaweed products.  The 
government believes aquaculture projects can be increased, and 
projects that output can grow from the current 2,500 tons to 90,000 
tons/year.  Western Cape Finance and Tourism MEC Garth Strachan said 
the industry is currently characterized by "overregulation, 
inappropriate and non-transparent application of legal instruments 
and uncoordinated institutional environment." 
 
¶6. (U) Western Cape aquaculture strategy will emphasize tax rebates 
or subsidies.  Masifundise Development Trust Director Naseegh Jaffer 
said these rebates would promote projects by smaller investors.  He 
noted that the strategy will "pre-zone" certain areas with the 
government assisting the private sector by identifying suitable 
zones.  Jaffer said one natural area for aquaculture would be from 
Gansbbaai to Mosel Bay in the southern Cape.  He stated that 
non-indigenous species of fish would be considered, depending on 
market demand, and environmental and risk assessments. 
 
------------------------------------------- 
South Africa to Launch New Electric Vehicle 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶7. (U) South African government spokesman Themba Maseko announced an 
Inter-Ministerial Committee will assess investing in the "Joule", 
South Africa's first battery-powered car.  Ministries participating 
on the Committee include DEAT, Minerals and Energy (DME), Science 
and Technology (DST), Trade and Industry (DTI), Treasury and 
Transport.  The Joule was first unveiled at the Paris Motor Show in 
2008, and more recently at the National Climate Change Conference in 
Johannesburg.  The Joule, designed to be a zero-emissions vehicle, 
will be Africa's first locally-manufactured-and-assembled car. 
South Africa-born automotive designer Keith Helfet, in partnership 
with Optimal Energy, a Cape Town based private company, designed the 
six-seat multipurpose vehicle, which will be powered by a normal 
220-volt home outlet battery.  A fully-charged battery will have a 
200 km driving range.  The Gauteng provincial government has 
expressed an interest in placing the first fleet order.  Gauteng is 
also being evaluated as a possible site for the first assembly 
plant. 
 
------------------------------------------ 
South Africa Enacts Scrap Tire Regulations 
------------------------------------------ 
Q------------------------------------------ 
 
¶8. (U) The South African Government is drafting regulations to 
facilitate environmentally-friendly scrap tire collection and 
disposal.  Proposed tire levies would range between R15.00 ($1.50) 
and R140.00 ($14.00).  South African Tire Recycling Project Chief 
Executive Etienne Human noted that the tire collection program would 
be implemented in phases, starting with car, busses and truck tires. 
 Human said industry supports the program and that discussions with 
mining companies will be held to determine how to economically 
collect and recycle mine tires, because they are so large.  Human 
stated the government would implement the program by the end this 
year, and that the scrap tire collection program could begin by 
mid-2010. 
 
------------------------------------- 
Van Schalkwyk Reaffirms South African 
Positions on UNFCC Annex 
------------------------------------- 
 
¶9. (U) South African DEAT Minister Marthinus Van Schalkwyk announced 
at a recent climate change conference that South Africa is not 
amenable to creating new classifications of countries under the 
 
PRETORIA 00000872  003.3 OF 004 
 
 
United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).  He 
said that the UNFCC created only two categories of parties - Annex I 
for developed countries, and Annex II for developing countries, and 
that any attempt to redefine or dilute the UNFCCC's "common but 
differentiated responsibilities' could raise political issues beyond 
climate change.  Van Schalkwyk emphasized the need to establish a 
legally binding instrument for measurable, reportable, finance, 
technology and capacity support from developed to developing 
countries. 
 
¶10. (U) Van Schalkwyk said, "Signals from President Barack Obama 
have been encouraging, although in substance the US is still on a 
zero reduction below 1990 levels by 2020 - a level viewed as 
unacceptable".  He added that no one disputes that emissions from 
developing countries are growing rapidly, and no nation has a 
plausible excuse for not doing its fair share in carbon reductions. 
He said South Africa as a developing country is taking its 
responsibility very seriously, and is making serious contributions 
in the fight for carbon emissions reduction. 
 
---------------------------- 
New National Park Proclaimed 
---------------------------- 
 
¶11. (U) DEAT established a new Garden Route National Park (GRNP) in 
Knysna, Eastern Cape province, combining 52,500 hectors of 
newly-proclaimed land and 68,000 hectors of the Tsitsikama and the 
Wilderness National Parks.  The area has diverse biomes including 
indigenous forests, lake and marine protected areas, lowland fynbos 
and mountain water catchment areas.  DEAT Minister Van Schalkwyk 
said DEAT has invested over R411 million ($41.1 million) in park 
infrastructure.  The South African government has increased 
financial assistance for national parks from R85.6 million ($8.5 
million) in 2004/05 to R205 million ($20.5 million) in 2009/10. 
With the addition of this new park, protected land areas in South 
Africa will increase from six to eight percent 
 
------------------------------------------ 
Carbon Capture and Storage Center Unveiled 
------------------------------------------ 
 
¶12. (U) DME Minister Buyelwa Sonjica opened a carbon capture and 
storage research center in Johannesburg at the end of March. 
Sonjica said that although South Africa is a coal-based economy, 
major coal producers "appreciate that carbon capture could help 
their industries in the future."  South Africa will demonstrate the 
new technology through a pilot program injecting carbon into rocks. 
Sonica said the government hopes to have a demonstration project by 
¶2020.  DME reports that South Africa emits over 400 million tons of 
carbon per annum, sixty percent of which could be available for 
storage.  The International Energy Agency described the center as, 
"one of the most promising options for mitigating emissions in the 
longer term". 
 
------------------------------------ 
Baboons Threaten Public in False Bay 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶13. (U) A baboon jumped through an open window into car filled with 
passengers at Millers Point on April 13, 2009.  Observers said the 
driver had been feeding the baboon prior to the event.  As the 
passengers screamed, the baboon ransacked the car searching for more 
food.  Eventually the baboon exited back through the window.  Baboon 
researchers have been calling for large signs warning the public 
that it is dangerous to feed baboons.  They are also seeking an 
Qthat it is dangerous to feed baboons.  They are also seeking an 
increase in the fine from R 500 ($60) to at least R 5,000 ($600). 
University of Cape Town baboon researcher Esm Beamish said, "This 
is concrete evidence that people feed baboons and that is why we 
have serious problems with that particular troop."  Beamish added 
that baboons have learned to associate vehicles with food and are 
able to open car doors easily.  Beamish said although the baboons 
will not "unlearn" that behavior, they will quit getting into cars 
if they no longer receive food in return.  She noted that "the 
minute people feed a baboon; it views that person as subordinate 
because in a wild troop only the subordinate baboons give away 
food." 
 
--------------------------------- 
Boundless South Africa Expedition 
--------------------------------- 
 
¶14. (U) The four-month SADC-sponsored Boundless Southern Africa 
Expedition will set out in May 2009 from Durban.  The goal of the 
expedition is to promote tourism and investment in the seven SADC 
Transfrontier Conservation Areas (TFCA), i.e., areas straddling two 
or more international borders where natural and cultural resources 
 
PRETORIA 00000872  004.3 OF 004 
 
 
are managed collaboratively.  SADC Tourism Ministers in 2005 
endorsed a TFCA Development Strategy to consolidate marketing, 
infrastructure development and investment.  Boundless Southern 
Africa is the consolidated TFCA marketing brand launched in May 2008 
with a secretariat hosted by South Africa's DEAT.  The expedition, 
led by National Geographic Travel staff member Kingsley Holgate will 
start at the National Tourism Indaba in Durban on May 11, 2009 and 
end at the mouth of the Orange River in August 2009.  The ten 
thousand kilometer expedition will cover nine countries, seven 
Transfrontier Conservation Areas and thirty National Parks and 
Nature Reserves.  The expedition will distribute mosquito nets to 
pregnant mothers and children under five, and will donate mobile 
libraries to communities around the TFCA. 
 
------------------------------- 
Pre-Historic Insects on Display 
------------------------------- 
 
¶15. (U) Cockroaches, flies, wasps and other insects from one hundred 
million years ago are on display at a new exhibit in Maropeng's 
Cradle of Humankind.  Wits University paleo-entomologist Dr. Ian 
McKay put together the exhibit, which includes prehistoric insect 
fossils found throughout southern Africa.  One exhibit features the 
griffen fly, a dragonfly look-alike with a wingspan of 70 cm (27.6 
inches).  Dr. McKay commented that prehistoric insects grew to such 
large sizes because oxygen concentrations in the atmosphere were 
higher, allowing for higher plant growth.  McKay noted that the 
insects that first appeared on earth approximately 400 million years 
ago would have been recognizable today as insects.  He stated that 
insects suddenly grew enormous about 300 million years ago. 
 
¶16. (U) The only insect that has remained the same size over four 
hundred million years is the cockroach, which looks today much like 
it did in prehistoric times.  The exhibit includes two live 
cockroaches and two fossil roaches found in the Karoo so that 
visitors can compare them.  The star attraction in the exhibit is 
the Orapa block discovered in the Orapa diamond mine in Botswana. 
That site is considered one of the richest in the world for insect 
fossils.  McKay said the site was once a volcanic lake.  Insects 
would end up in the "lake," be trapped in the sediment and then 
fossilized.  The Orapa block contains the fossils of over forty 
different insect species, including wasps, and scarab beetles.  Only 
one-third of the species in the Orapa block have been identified. 
The exhibit stays open through July. 
 
------------------------------ 
New Satellite Antenna Launched 
------------------------------ 
 
¶17. (U) The South African Satellite Application Center (SAC), a 
division of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research 
(CSIR) established a new X-band satellite tracking antenna.  SAC has 
erected a 7.3 meter diameter X-band satellite dish at a cost of R22 
million ($2.2 million).  CSIR engineers worked with French company 
In-SNEC to install the dish.  CSIR President Sibusiso Sibisi noted 
that the satellite will enable CSIR to acquire valuable data to 
support national, regional, and global priorities. 
The new dish receives data from France's SPOT-4 and SPOT-5, the 
joint Brazilian and Chinese CBERS-2B and the joint 
Argentina/Brazil/Danish/French/Italian/US SAC-C satellites.  DST 
Minster Mosebudi Mangena emphasized that South Africa's goal is to 
become a global player in the earth observation satellites.  SAC has 
Qbecome a global player in the earth observation satellites.  SAC has 
seventeen other antennas in addition to this new dish.
