Â¶1. U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS 
 
a. "U.S. media acknowledged that there is insufficient evidence for 
the "Chinese hacker" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(04/16): "Tang Lan from the China Institute of 
Contemporary International Relations tells the Global Times that the 
U.S. has the most advanced internet technologies and creates the 
rules of the global internet network.  Thus it obtains the right to 
speak in this field.  She says that the U.S. always likes to attack 
China, by saying that Chinese internet hackers have attacked the 
American internet network.  In fact, China has also been attacked by 
hackers.  'China is also the victim of internet hacker attacks, 
ranking as the second in the world following the U.S.  However, 
currently China does not have the technology to monitor the safety 
of its internet and is always in a passive position to cope with 
internet attacks.  China cannot provide sufficient evidence on its 
suffering from hacker attacks,' says Tang Lan." 
 
 
b. "The Pentagon's financial World War game" 
The official Xinhua News Agency international news publication 
International Herald Leader (Guoji Xianqu Daobao) (04/16):   "This 
simulation reflects America's strategies.  It has a military nature. 
 The U.S. Defense Department has acknowledged that the financial 
crisis will reshape the world.  As the 'familiar faces' who have 
always somehow been treated as strategic competitors in the eyes of 
the U.S. Defense Department, Russia and China are assumed to be 
involved in this simulated economic war.  Japan and America's 
European allies are not on the list, although their economic powers 
are quite outstanding.  This indicates that the 'economic war' 
simulation has not considered the basic facts of the global economic 
status quo.  Instead, it deals with more political and military 
concerns. 
America's conclusion on why the U.S. will fail in this simulated 
"economic war" is interesting.  It is likely that the U.S. will 
focus China as its target and reduce threats toward Russia.  In this 
war game, the U.S. believes that the Treasury bonds that China owns 
have strategic importance.  The U.S. worries that China will sell 
its Treasury bonds and, thus, has simulated a situation in which 
China might do so.  Whether or not China intends to do so, this is 
not good news for China. 
Although it appears that China is the winner at the end of the game, 
China should not feel too proud.  China should be warned by the 
important message being sent by the U.S. Defense Department, that 
they do not think economic ties are just pure reciprocal actions. 
It reflects the Pentagon's sober thinking and hyper-realistic 
attitude toward national security.  China should not continue to 
believe that 'economy is economy and security is security.'  This is 
a kind of simple thinking which only concerns cost and profits and 
is based on the interests of economic benefits.  If we allow this 
way of thinking to take the lead in the process of developing our 
economic policies while ignoring the relevant interests of our 
national safety and security, we won't fulfill our goal of ensuring 
national security."
