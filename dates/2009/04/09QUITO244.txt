Classified By: Ambassador Heather M. Hodges for Reasons 1.4 (b&d) 
 
¶1.  (C) SUMMARY.  The GOE's focus for the April 17-19 Summit 
of the Americas has included seeking a one-on-one meeting 
between the presidents.  One issue that Ecuador would want to 
stress during the Summit is the financial crisis.  Other 
issues are currently being defined by the Foreign Minister's 
office.  END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2.  (C) Immediately prior to an April 2 videoconference with 
Ambassador John Maisto, MFA Director General for North 
America Ambassador Juan Salazar reiterated the GOE's request 
for a bilateral meeting with President Obama at the Summit. 
He noted that President Correa already had bilateral meetings 
arranged with his counterparts in several countries, 
including Mexico and probably Canada.  He added that a 
bilateral meeting with POTUS could be brief, but would be 
very beneficial and would enable the two presidents to 
establish a bilateral agenda.  This echoes the reasoning we 
heard from the GOE on other occasions, most notably in Under 
Secretary Orbe's March 4 meeting with the Ambassador (Ref B). 
 
¶3.  (C) MFA Multilateral Affairs' Alternate Coordinator of 
Summits Marjorie Ulloa also attended the April 2 
videoconference and told us after the meeting that the GOE 
generally supported the Summit's themes and the current draft 
Summit Declaration.  She noted, however, that the GOE did not 
believe that the current financial crisis would receive 
sufficient attention at the Summit.  She added that the draft 
Summit Declaration only included one small paragraph on the 
subject that did little to address the issue. 
 
¶4.  (C) Ulloa said on April 2 that that the two issues likely 
to be addressed in President Correa's remarks would be the 
financial crisis and migration (likely meaning migrants' 
rights), but then told PolOff on April 6 that only the 
financial crisis issue remained certain.  She added that the 
drafting of Correa's remarks had been transferred to the 
Minister's office and that she was no longer sure what would 
be raised.  When asked if Ecuador would mention Cuba, she 
said that the "'primer ministro cubano' during his visit to 
Quito" had requested that the GOE not raise the embargo 
against Cuba because it was a bilateral issue that would be 
dealt with best directly with the U.S.  She noted, however, 
that she could not say for sure whether Correa would bring up 
the issue as the decision would be handled by the Presidency, 
not the MFA.  Regarding biofuels, Ulloa commented that while 
Ecuador would support the initiative included in the draft 
Declaration, this would not be important for the GOE at the 
upcoming Summit.
