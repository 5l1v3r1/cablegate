REF: SECSTATE 29993 
 
¶1. (SBU) On March 30, Ambassador delivered reftel demarche to 
Minister of State for Defense Ademola Seriki.  The Minister 
affirmed that the Nigerian Contingent Owned Equipment (COE) 
is in Lagos, awaiting shipment, and would be forwarded to 
Darfur as soon as possible.  In a related conversation, 
Nigerian Army Staff's Director of Peacekeeping Operations 
Brigadier General Sani told Mission's OSC Chief that all COE 
is ready and is awaiting shipment to Sudan via United Nations 
vessel.  He did not offer an estimated shipping date, but 
blamed Lagos Harbor's well-known congestion for delays (the 
current backlog in Lagos Harbor is reportedly 105 days or 
more). 
 
¶2. (SBU) Meanwhile OSC and Political will check with local UN 
contacts to see if they can provide an estimated timeline for 
a UN vessel to not only pick up COE but also deliver it to 
Sudan. 
 
¶3. (U) This cable was coordinated with Consulate Lagos.
