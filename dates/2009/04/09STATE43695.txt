SUBJECT: USUN INSTRUCTION:  UNMIS EXPLANATION OF VOTE 
 
¶1.  This is an action request.  When voting to extend the 
mandate of the UN Mission in Sudan, USUN may draw from the 
explanation of vote in paragraph 2 if USUN deems an 
explanation is necessary and appropriate. 
 
¶2.  Begin Points: 
 
The United States' affirmative vote to extend the UN Mission 
in Sudan (UNMIS) reflects our unwavering support for the work 
the UN is doing in southern Sudan, but more importantly, it 
reflects our continued belief that full implementation of the 
Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) is vital to bringing 
lasting peace to the people of Sudan.  After years of 
conflict and economic deprivation, the citizens of Sudan 
deserve a future of peace and promise. 
 
The recent expulsions and closure of humanitarian and 
development assistance organizations by the Government of 
Sudan was another disappointing and disheartening blow to the 
health, safety, and welfare of many of Sudan's most 
vulnerable citizens. 
 
Despite whatever explanation is offered for these expulsions 
and closures, this action cannot be justified.  The sudden 
expulsions of the NGOs put too many innocent civilians at 
grave risk.  Ultimately, the Government of Sudan bears 
primary responsibility for the welfare of its people.  We 
therefore urge the Government of Sudan to take immediate 
steps to restore effective assistance to Sudan's most 
vulnerable civilians, and to alleviate their suffering. 
Promises have recently been made in this regard, and we 
expect the quick and complete fulfillment of these 
commitments to improve the humanitarian situation in Sudan. 
 
We fully support UNMIS as it continues its work by helping to 
implement the CPA, helping to protect vulnerable citizens, 
and helping the people of Sudan achieve a lasting peace. 
 
End Points.
