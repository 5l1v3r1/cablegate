Title- Swine flu 
 
Editorial in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (4-28) says: "....It is time 
for readiness and not for panic.  Until it is confirmed that there 
is a link between A/H1N1 with all the suspected deaths and a high 
level of transmission between humans, there is not much to do 
besides await epidemiologists' conclusions with serenity." 
 
Title- Cooperation between Iran and Brazil 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (4-28) by Iran's Ambassador to 
Brazil, Mohsen Shaterzadeh, states: "....One of the criteria that 
helps the most in the rapprochement between the two countries 
[Brazil and Iran] is the view of their Chief of States with regards 
to foreign issues.  Both presidents' slogans are social justice; the 
fight against poverty and exclusion....We are facing the emergence 
of new powers in the world, which are breaking monopolies of 
industrial and technological production that shortly ago belonged to 
few countries.  In this context, Iran and Brazil have words to 
say.....In President Ahmadinejad's government there is an effort to 
promote Iran's cooperation with Latin American countries, based on 
the principle of mutual respect and non-intervention in the internal 
matters of other countries."
