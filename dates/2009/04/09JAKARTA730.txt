SUBJECT: NEWMONT WINS BUYAT BAY CASE IN SUPREME COURT 
 
REF: 2007 Jakarta 1332 
 
¶1. (U) According to Newmont executives, the Indonesian Supreme Court 
handed down a decision this week that upholds the 2007 acquittal by 
a court in Manado, North Sulawesi.  The prosecutors in the case 
appealed the full acquittal in the environmental case against PT 
Newmont Minahasa Raya, Newmont's subsidiary in charge of the 
Sulawesi mine, but were unable to convince the Supreme Court that 
the prosecution had merit.  The text of the ruling has not yet been 
made public. 
 
¶2. (U) Also exonerated by the decision was Richard Ness, who had 
been President of PT Newmont Minahasa Raya.
