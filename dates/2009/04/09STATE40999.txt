SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR ISRAEL TO POSTPONE GICNT WORKSHOP 
 
REF: A) TEL AVIV 000863 
 
¶1.  (U) This is an action request for Embassy Tel Aviv. 
Please see paragraph 3. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) BACKGROUND:  Per REF A, the GOI proposed an 
expert-level Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism 
(GICNT) workshop in November 2009 to focus on legal aspects 
and forensics issues related to combating nuclear and 
radiological terrorism. The GOI requested an answer from 
GICNT co-chairs U.S. and Russia on the feasibility of the 
workshop to begin planning in earnest and to announce it at 
the GICNT plenary in June. 
 
¶3. (SBU) ACTION REQUEST:  Post is requested to inform the GOI 
that Washington believes the workshop proposal is an 
excellent idea, and we thank the GOI for their work. 
However, it will not be feasible to conduct such an event in 
November due to conflicting GICNT events. Washington suggests 
the GOI may not receive the representation the workshop 
deserves unless the date is changed.   Washington suggests 
early or late February 2010 as alternative dates.   Post is 
also requested to let the GOI know that we would be happy to 
work with them to tailor the agenda and line up the 
appropriate experts.  The forensics workshop proposed by the 
GOI would be a logical next step in augmenting our mutual 
efforts to combat nuclear and radiological terrorism. 
 
¶4. Washington appreciates Post's assistance.
