SUBJECT: SIXTH SOFA PLENARY MAKES SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Jackson McDonald, Special Advisor for Securit 
y Negotiations and Agreements, for reasons 1.4 b and d. 
 
¶1.  (SBU)  The parties achieved significant progress in round 
six of U.S.-Poland SOFA negotiations held in Warsaw April 
21-23.  Deputy Defense Minister Stanislaw Komorowski, Deputy 
Foreign Minister Andrzej Kremer, and Deputy Finance Minister 
Jacek Dominik led the Polish delegation.  Ambassador Jackson 
McDonald, Special Advisor for Security Negotiations and 
Agreements, led the U.S. delegation. 
 
¶2.  (C)  In the one-on-one initial session, DDM Komorowski 
told Ambassador McDonald that he wanted to produce as clean a 
text as possible during this round and the next so he could 
then seek new instructions (and possibly greater flexibility) 
from his political superiors on the last outstanding issues 
(e.g., claims, etc). 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  The sides reached full, provisional agreement on 
several articles, including discipline, determination of 
jurisdiction, telecommunications, logistical support, 
utilities, and labor.  The parties reached near-agreement on 
personal tax exemptions and pre-trial detention.  The sides 
made some progress on jurisdiction, but more work remains. 
¶4.  (SBU)  On the crucial matter of official tax exemptions, 
the Poles agreed to grant exemption for official personnel 
and contractors, but differences remain over the mechanism to 
achieve tax neutrality -- the Poles want the U.S. to pay VAT 
and file for reimbursement; U.S. Department of Defense wants 
exemption at the point of purchase. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The next round is scheduled for June 8-10 due to 
unavailability of DDM Komorowski and DFM Kremer before then.
