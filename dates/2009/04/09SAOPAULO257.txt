Media Reaction - President Obama's first 100 days; Sao Paulo 
April 29, 2009 
 
Title- Obama has made his mark in 100 days of government 
 
Editorial in business oriented Valor Economico (4-29) states:"The 
conventional political wisdom states that a new president should try 
to concentrate his efforts on a few well defined targets and pursue 
them one at a time.  President Obama challenged conventional wisdom 
and in his first 100 days put in place a series of measures and 
plans on all possible fronts.  The initial balance is widely 
positive and we can't say we're not surprised -Obama had said he 
would do exactly this.....A good start in the Presidency is not a 
guarantee of success, but increases a lot the chances of obtaining 
it." 
 
Title- Obama and his first 100 days 
 
Op-ed in center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (4-29) by Celso Ming says: 
"No U.S. Chief of State has begun his administration with problems 
so complicated as President Obama.  In regards to his performance in 
the area of economics, we may make three observations on these first 
100 days.  The first one regards the way President Obama's 
administration has dealt with the huge problems in 
banks......Obama's administration.....decided to better evaluate 
toxic bonds by promoting a stress test. .....This process is still 
under way but showed itself to be a more adequate answer than the 
previous efforts.  The second observation is that [President 
Obama's] electoral speech related to the employment issue will not 
be accomplished - at least not as it was understood 
before......Finally, I must say that if Obama did not fail in his 
first international act as Chief of State [at the G20 Summit], he 
also was not that successful."
