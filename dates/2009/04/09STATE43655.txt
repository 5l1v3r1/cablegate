Begin text: 
 
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. 
 
We warmly welcome you to the Permanent Council, Foreign 
Minister Diaconescu.  The United States and Romania have a 
close bilateral relationship, and we are pleased to work 
together with you constructively on a wide range of issues. 
 
Romania has been an important supporter of international 
efforts in Kosovo, Afghanistan, and Iraq, and is an active, 
valued, and constructive participant in the Euro-Atlantic 
community. 
 
Romania remains a valuable OSCE partner, and has exhibited 
leadership not only by chairing the organization in the past, 
but also by hosting a variety of conferences, including an 
event focusing on combating discrimination and promoting 
mutual respect and understanding. 
 
Romania, as a European Union member state with a unique 
perspective on the EU's neighbors, has also been a valuable 
supporter of the European Union,s Eastern Partnership 
Initiative, and a strong proponent of efforts to encourage 
closer ties to Euro-Atlantic institutions.  We note that 
recent events in Moldova have caused great concern for the 
Romanian public and government.  We continue to encourage a 
constructive relationship between Moldova and Romania, and 
urge both sides to focus on productive dialogue and 
conclusion of ongoing bilateral treaty negotiations. The 
United States remains concerned about the situation in 
Moldova, as outlined by Ambassador Remler,s report to the 
Permanent Council on April 23.  We call on the government to 
address concerns raised by opposition parties about problems 
with the voter lists in a cooperative and transparent manner. 
 It is important that allegations of mistreatment of 
detainees be investigated, and High Representative Solana,s 
proposal to include the opposition and international 
community in such an investigation is example of how these 
allegations can be examined. 
 
We agree with the Foreign Minister that the OSCE is uniquely 
suited to play a central role in addressing and resolving the 
protracted conflicts which constitute a continuing question 
mark for European security.  With its emphasis on 
comprehensive security in all three dimensions along with its 
broad base of participating States, the OSCE serves as an 
example of the importance of an integrated approach to 
European security.  As we have heard a call for a renewed 
look at the arrangements dedicated to ensuring Europe,s 
security, the United States believes the OSCE should be the 
primary venue for any such discussion. 
 
Mr. Minister, the United States looks forward to continued 
close cooperation with Romania, and to building on an already 
solid foundation to deepen our bilateral relationship.  Thank 
you again for joining us today. 
 
Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. 
CLINTON
