¶1. (C) After alerting our vacationing MFA counterparts on 
Easter Sunday, we delivered reftel demarche to MFA UN Desk 
Officer Adriana Murillo and Disarmament Chief Carlos Cordero 
the morning of April 13.  Murillo stated that Costa Rica 
initially would have preferred a stronger response, including 
a UNSC Resolution, to deal with North Korea's violation of 
UNSC Resolution 1718.  However, as that was no longer a 
viable option, they are satisfied with, and prepared to 
support, the Presidential Statement. 
 
¶2. (C) Cordero stated that after examining the Presidential 
Statement, which they received from their Mission in New 
York, the GOCR agrees that by using existing structures 
within UNSCR 1718 it could accomplish the same goals as a new 
resolution. They requested that we update them with any 
further news regarding a hoped for adoption of the 
Presidential Statement. 
 
¶3. (C) COMMENT:  Costa Rica has always portrayed itself as a 
"champion of disarmament", and appears ready to back up that 
claim with regards to North Korea.  In addition, our MFA 
interlocutors did not insist on textual modifications to the 
draft PRST.  Given Costa Rica,s stated desire for a stronger 
response, the GOCR should be an  ally if/when further 
sanctions are sought under the auspices of UNSCR 1718.
