end use check.  LES Natalya Shipitsina advised Bogdanov that the 
reftel commodity is subject to end use verification by the 
Department of Commerce, Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS). 
Bogdanov refused to meet with the Moscow export control team, 
stating that the reftel commodity was bought for a pilot project, 
which due to the financial crisis did not go further.  Bogdanov also

allowed full access to Insys Corporation facilities and found it to 
be a full functioning business producing products for which the 
reftel commodity was licensed. 
 
¶9. Recommendations: Post recommends Insys Corporation, Moscow, 
Russia, as a reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. origin
