"Obama's Government launches its environmental offensive" 
 
Editorial in business oriented Valor Econtmico (4-9) says: 
"....Obama's government marked its debut in the negotiations for 
climate change. He sent a high-level team to the United Nations 
meeting that ended yesterday in Bonn. The State Department envoy 
Todd Stern made it clear that the new administration will give 
priority to actions against global warming.....The U.S. called for a 
meeting in Washington at the end oQthe month with the 16 major 
economies of the world, this  initiative may accelerate a consensus. 
Bush times are definitely behind us." 
 
 
"Talking to Islam - Obama puts U.S. closer to the Muslim World" 
 
Editorial in center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (4-9) states: 
"[President Barack] Obama seems close to assert himself as a great 
statesman-for his extraordinary ability to put in words and to 
express in actions full of symbolisms its political intentions, 
especially in the external front."
