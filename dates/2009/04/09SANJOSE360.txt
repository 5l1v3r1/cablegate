REF: A. WHA/CEN-SAN JOSE EMAILS OF 28 APRIL 
     ¶B. STATE 33709 
     ¶C. SAN JOSE 321 
 
¶1. (SBU) On April 28, we pressed the MFA on Kosovo IMF and 
World Bank membership, further to Refs. Earlier, we had 
informally coordinated approaches with the German Ambassador, 
who reportedly demarched FM Bruno Stagno directly on the 
issue the week of April 20; this may have helped lay the 
groundwork for the positive GOCR response.  On April 29 MFA 
Deputy Director of Foreign Policy Linyi Baidal assured us 
that Costa Rica would vote in support of Kosovo's candidacy 
for World Bank and IMF membership. 
 
¶2. (SBU) COMMENT: The MFA's support for Kosovo's World 
Bank/IMF candidacy is in line with the GOCR's quick 
recognition of Kosovar statehood, and meets our expectations 
as reported in Reftel C. We will follow up to verify that the 
GOCR will vote before the May 5 IMF deadline.
