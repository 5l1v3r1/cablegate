SUBJECT: OBAMA'S POSITIVE MESSAGES RESONATE WITH TURKISH MEDIA 
WEDNESDAY, APRIL 8, 2009 
 
In Today's Papers 
 
Obama's Visit Marks the End of One Era and opens a New Page in U.S. 
Ties With Turkey (Zaman) 
Media outlets continue to praise the messages given by U.S. 
President Barack Obama during his visit to Turkey.  Outlets also 
note that Obama's visit has put Turkey back on the global map. 
Mainstream Hurriyet's banner front page headline reads, "It's a 
Different World With Obama," as "The Bush Period in Turkey Is 
Brought to An End," and "Obama's messages broke the ice between 
Christians and Muslims," as "Obama took the first steps to heal the 
damage inflicted upon Turkey during the eight years of the Bush 
administration." Mainstream Sabah comments in its banner headline, 
"One Visit, 1000 Headlines," and notes, "Obama's historic visit has 
made Turkey the focus of international attention." 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet reports, "Obama Came to Correct the 
Bush Administration's Damage to Turkey and the Islamic World." 
Mainstream Aksam headlines, "Obama Opens a New Page with The Islamic 
World." 
 
President Obama's roundtable with students generated a lot of media 
attention over Obama's positive messages to the youth.  Mainstream 
Vatan reports, "The Agenda is Turkey" now that Obama has paid a 
visit and "met with modern Turkish youth to say that Turkey is a 
modern Western country."  Mainstream Sabah notes Obama told the 
youth town hall meeting, "The world is what you make of it."  In 
"Obama Conquers the Youth," mainstream Milliyet points out Obama 
repeated his support for Turkey's EU entry to his roundtable with 
Turkish youth "Obama once again offers support to Turkey's EU bid" 
and says that "as a NATO member, Turkey should be accepted into the 
EU."  Leftist Taraf notes Obama told Turkish youth, "Turkey sends 
its troops into harm's way in Afghanistan as a member of NATO, and 
as a NATO ally, Turkey should be given the right to sell apricots to 
Europe and travel freely in the EU."  Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet 
headlines with a quote from Obama, "You Can Create New Bridges." 
Islamist-oriented Yeni Safak and Zaman both note "Obama ended the 
youth discussion prior to the Islamic call to prayer" out of 
"respect to practicing Muslim students." 
 
Columnists Remain Pleased with The Effects of Obama's Visit 
Sedat Ergin wrote in mainstream Milliyet, "President Obama has given 
an end to the debate surrounding the Bush administration's 
characterization of Turkey as a "moderate Islamic state."  Obama 
emphasized Turkey's secular democratic principles and emphasized the 
influence of Turkey's founder Ataturk and Ataturk's secular values. 
Turkey, with all of its qualities as expressed by Obama, has become 
distinguished throughout the U.S."  Sami Kohen wrote in mainstream 
Milliyet, "President Obama signaled he would not use the 'G word' on 
April 24, Armenian Remembrance Day, but he also urged for the speedy 
normalization of ties between Armenia and Turkey.  Since the issue 
has some other strings attached to it, such as Azerbaijan and 
Nagorno Karabakh, normalization is still a matter of time.  In any 
case, Obama's approach gives opportunities and advantages to Turkey 
which we should be able to use in the spirit of our model 
partnership."  Ali Bayramoglu wrote in Islamist oriented Yeni Safak, 
"Obama's visit demonstrates that Turkey has two choices - either we 
can act courageously toward a better future or we can continue to 
live through fears and taboos."  Mehmet Barlas wrote in mainstream 
Sabah, "Obama emphasized change in a constantly changing world, and 
as such there are two options ahead of us -  either Turkey can be a 
modern democracy or Turkey will become like Saddam's Iraq or today's 
Iran."  Hamit Bilici wrote in Islamist-oriented Zaman, "Unlike the 
U.S. under the Obama administration, the Europeans are acting out of 
pride and unilateralism.  In this new era, it looks like Turkey and 
the U.S. will become even more closer, while the EU is increasingly 
starting to resemble the George W. Bush administration."  Oktay Eksi 
wrote in mainstream Hurriyet, "Turkey was chosen as the location for 
Obama's Muslim outreach, and very rightly so."  Murat Yetkin wrote 
in liberal-intellectual Radikal, "As explained by President Obama, 
the whole world is turning toward a new order both politically and 
 
ANKARA 00000519  002 OF 003 
 
 
economically.  And, Obama has demonstrated that Turkey should stand 
in an important place in the new world order." 
 
Turkey-Armenia to Open Borders, Normalize Ties 
Papers report Turkey and Armenia are in the "final stage" of 
negotiations regarding border openings, and the two nations agreed 
on a protocol which will not be made public before April 24. 
Leftist-nationalist Cumhuriyet writes that before April 24, Ankara 
would implement an 'action plan' to open the border and open 
diplomatic representations in both countries.  The protocol will be 
signed at the April 16 Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC) summit 
talks in Yerevan, says Cumhuriyet.  Foreign Minister Ali Babacan 
told reporters yesterday Turkey was "determined to continue talks 
with Armenia which aim to normalize ties with Yerevan as well as 
open the borders."  Mainstream Hurriyet reports that at President 
Gul's request, Obama phoned Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev, 
assuring him that the U.S. would work for the settlement of 
Nagorno-Karabakh dispute between Armenia and Azerbaijan. 
 
Mainstream Sabah reports that in a brief meeting on Monday evening 
with the Turkish, Armenian and Swiss foreign ministers, President 
Obama expressed support for Turkey-Armenia talks and encouraged the 
sides to "progress" in their talks.  The two countries will discuss 
the Kars Agreement regarding the border between Turkey and Armenia 
so that Yerevan will cease its territorial claims from Turkey.  The 
border will be reopened and trade will start between the two 
countries. 
 
Allegations Abound Regarding a New Turkish Base in Northern Iraq 
Mainstream Sabah cites the report on the Kurdistan Strategic 
Research Center's internet site www.liekolin.org which claims that 
Turkey, in addition to its base in Amediye town in northern Iraq, is 
preparing to open a new base between Diyana-Sideka regions in 
northern Iraq.  Sabah reports that this base will also serve as the 
headquarters for the tripartite mechanism between the US, Turkey and 
Iraq against the PKK.  Sabah says the website notes "The PKK was 
disturbed by the news because their camps in Hakurk and Hinere 
regions are going to be very close to the region picked for the new 
Turkish base." 
 
Kurdish Conference in Erbil Put Off until May 
Mainstream Aksam reports the international Kurdish conference to be 
held in Erbil in northern Iraq has been postponed until May, mainly 
due to the rejection of the PKK to lay down its weapons.  Turkey, 
reluctant to be at the same table with the PKK, is expected to join 
the gathering as an observer, says Aksam. 
 
French FM Kouchner Withdraws Support for Turkey's EU Entry 
Mainstreams Milliyet and Vatan report that speaking to German RTL 
TV, French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said that he no longer 
supports Turkey's EU membership bid.  He said "I am concerned that 
Turkey is advancing towards a more Islamic direction while 
secularism is weakening in the country.  I was shocked to see 
Turkey's stance at the NATO summit and I do not support Turkey's EU 
membership any longer."
