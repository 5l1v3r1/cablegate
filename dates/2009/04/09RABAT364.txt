SUBJECT: REQUEST FOR MORE U.S. PARTICIPATION IN UPCOMING 
GLOBAL INITIATIVE CONFERENCE IN MOROCCO 
 
REF: STATE 40696 
 
¶1.  (U)  This is an action request (see paragraph 3-5). 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Summary:  The Government of Morocco (GOM) 
appreciates United States Government (USG) support for the 
Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism (GICNT) 
Conference to be hosted in Rabat June 3-5.  The GOM requests 
additional USG support.  Specifically, it wants the U.S. to 
make additional presentations and choose a session in which 
it can chair.  In addition, the GOM wants the U.S. delegation 
to register on-line using the GICNT Global Initiative (GI) 
Web Portal.  Due to limited Embassy resources during this 
very busy time, Post recommends logistics for this visit be 
handled directly from the United States.  End Summary. 
 
¶2.  (SBU) Poloff discussed reftel message with Moroccan 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Head of Security and Disarmament 
Affairs Bouchaib Eloumni on April 28.  Eloumni was 
appreciative to learn that Deputy Director of the U.S. 
Department of State's Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction 
and Terrorism (WMDT) Dexter Ingram will lead the U.S. 
delegation along with WMDT Security Analyst Daniela Carcani 
to participate in the Rabat hosted GICNT Conference June 3-5. 
 
 
¶3. (SBU) In addition to Mr. Ingram's planned presentation 
entitled, "The Role of National Response Plans in Preventing 
Illicit Trafficking in Nuclear and Radioactive Materials", 
Eloumni requested that the U.S. delegation deliver one or two 
additional presentations.  Eloumni suggested that a 
presentation on the GICNT Nuclear Detection Architecture 
Model Guidelines Document would be very interesting, 
appropriate, and generate good discussion.  Eloumni asked 
that the American delegation speak on a third topic of its 
choice but suggested the topic, "What Can GICNT Member 
Countries Do To Address Illicit Trafficking?"  Please inform 
Post via Front Channel cable on the Department's willingness 
to give additional presentations and the topics of its choice. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) The GOM requests that the U.S. delegation chair 
either the June 3 afternoon session, the June 4 morning 
session, or the June 4 afternoon session.  Please respond and 
give the delegation's preference. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) Eloumni informed PolOff that the Governments of 
France, The Netherlands, and Pakistan have confirmed their 
participation in the conference.  The Russians have not yet 
responded but Eloumni is hopeful he will receive a positive 
response from them soon.  Eloumni asked that the U.S. 
delegation please register its intent to participate on the 
GICNT GI Web Portal.

busy time, Post recommends that logistics for this visit be
