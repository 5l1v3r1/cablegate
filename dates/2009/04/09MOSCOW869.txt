¶1. Unauthorized disclosure of the information provided below is 
prohibited by Section 12C of the Export Administration Act. 
 
¶2. Reftel requested a post-shipment verification to determine the 
legitimacy and reliability of the end-user, Synertech Ltd., Moscow, 
Russia. The company is listed on BIS license applications: D414258 
as the ultimate consignee of radiation hardened MOSFETs (metal oxide 
semiconductor field effect transistors). These items are controlled 
for national security and anti-terrorism reasons under ECCN 9A004. 
The licensee is International Rectifier Corp, 233 Kansas St., El 
Segundo, CA 90245. 
 
¶3. On April 1, 2009, Export Control Attach Peter Liston and LES 
Natalya Shipitsina conducted the requested post-shipment 
verification at the offices of Synertech Ltd., 53 Aviamotornaya St., 
Moscow, Russia. The export control team met with Evgeny Motorny, 
General Director, Vladimir Polishkarov, Technical Director, and 
Sergey Potapov, Project Manager. 
 
¶4. Synertech Ltd. is the first European-Russian joint venture aimed 
for space systems and equipment marketing, technology transfer, 
development and production for Russian and International markets. 
The shareholders of Synertech are: RNII KP (Federal State Unitary 
Enterprise, Russian Institute of Space Device Engineering), EADS 
Astrium SAS, and TESAT SpaceCom.  TESAT SpaceCom GmbH is a 100% 
subsidiary of EADS Astrium. 
 
¶5. According to Evgeny Motorny, General Director of Synertech Ltd., 
its goal is to consolidate European and Russian business knowledge 
and management experience in the field of on-board and ground based 
equipment for space applications.  Motorny stated that Synertech 
Ltd. hopes to provide the highest quality and advanced payload for 
Russian domestic telecommunication and remote-sensing projects. 
 
¶6. The reftel commodities will be placed inside SSPAs, solid state 
power amplifiers, for use in the GLONASS satellite program.  Each 
satellite requires 12 SSPAs.  The satellite system is in the second 
generation and will therefore need additional MOSFETs for years to 
come according to Motorny. 
 
¶7. The export control team found that Synertech Ltd. has the 
technical and commercial sophistication for which the reftel 
commodities were designed.  The firm appears to have sufficient 
staff with the required skills.  Synertech Ltd. has a legitimate 
need and a legitimate end use for the reftel commodities. 
 
¶8. Recommendations: Post recommends Synertech Ltd., Moscow, Russia, 
as a reliable recipient of sensitive U.S. origin commodities.
