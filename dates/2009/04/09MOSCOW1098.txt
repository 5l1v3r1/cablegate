¶1. (SBU) In an April 21 meeting, Andrew Kuznetsov confirmed to us 
that he ordered the reloading bullets listed on this license.  He 
said that he would personally use all these reloading bullets to 
train for and participate in a varmint hunting tournament in July. 
Kuznetsov told us he regularly uses 10,000 to 20,000 rounds of 
ammunition per month.  The ammunition, he said, is stored in a safe 
in his apartment in accordance with Russian law. 
 
¶2. (SBU) According to Kuznetsov, he never ordered any ammunition 
components from the U.S. prior to November 2008.  He originally 
ordered small amounts of ammunition to try out the product.  Once he 
determined the ammunition was of good quality, he ordered more.  He 
said he places orders for large quantities of reloading rounds so as 
to save himself the trouble of placing more, smaller orders. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Kuznetsov told us he does not sell defense articles or 
services of any kind.  He added that he understood the restrictions 
on USML items, including restrictions on re-transfers and 
re-exports. 
 
¶4. (SBU) On the basis of this interview, Andrew Kuznetsov gave us no 
reason to doubt the bona fides of this transaction.
