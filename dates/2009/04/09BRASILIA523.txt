(U) THIS MESSAGE IS SENSITIVE BUT UNCLASSIFIED AND NOT FOR INTERNET 
DISTRIBUTION.  PLEASE HANDLE ACCORDINGLY. 
 
¶1.  (SBU) This report provides an update on developments in Brazil 
regarding the H1N1 Flu outbreak. 
 
NEW REPORTED CASES: 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Health Ministry still has not confirmed any cases of 
H1N1 flu in Brazil.  As of the afternoon of Tuesday, April 28,tThe 
National Agency on Health Vigilance (ANVISA) and the Health Ministry 
are currently monitoring 20 cases of suspected infections in the 
states of Santa Catarina, Rio de Janeiro, Amazonas, Minas Gerais, 
Rio Grande do Norte, Bahia, Parana and Para.  Most of these cases 
have originated from travelers returning to Brazil from Mexico and 
the United States with flu-like symptoms.  Health Ministry officials 
tell Post that six cases are being ruled out as possible H1N1 Flu 
cases. 
 
BRAZILIAN GOVERNMENT'S RECENT ACTIONS: 
 
¶3.  (SBU) The Health Ministry and ANVISA are urging the public to 
remain calm and not to panic.  Many of the individuals suspected of 
infection have been placed in isolated and controlled areas at local 
hospitals.  The Brazilian Government has created a working group 
comprised of officials from the Ministries of Health and Agriculture 
and officials from ANVISA to deal with H1N1 Flu in Brazil.  This 
group is meeting on a daily basis, if not more often.  Working 
groups dealing with H1N1 Flue have been set up at some of Brazil's 
largest airports.  These airport groups include support from the 
Brazilian Airport Infrastructure Company (INFRAERO) and the 
Brazilian customs officials (Receita Federal).  The Health Ministry 
has trained responders from its toll-free health hotline on how to 
advise people who call with concerns regarding H1N1 Flu. The 
Ministry has also released a list of 51 hospitals in the country 
that are prepared to receive individuals with cases of H1N1 Flu. 
 
¶4.  (SBU) ANVISA and the Ministry of Health have printed around 
140,000 pamphlets with information regarding the virus in 
Portuguese, Spanish, and English, and have been passing them out at 
six different airports throughout the country.  In addition, 
INFRAERO officers have been instructed to monitor passengers coming 
into Brazil on flights originating from the United States and Mexico 
for signs of the flu.  Aircraft coming in from the United States and 
Mexico have been instructed to make an announcement directing 
passengers with flu-like symptoms to notify crewmembers on the 
plane.  The crewmembers have been instructed to notify ANVISA and 
INFRAERO once they land about individuals who are experiencing such 
symptoms.  These individuals are then to be inspected on the plane 
by ANVISA and INFRAERO officials, and taken by ambulance directly to 
a hospital if needed.  In addition, ANVISA is collecting passenger 
information from baggage slips so as to notify passengers in case of 
a suspected infection or outbreak originating from a particular 
flight. 
 
¶5.  (SBU) The daily newspapers "O Globo" and "Jornal do Brasil" 
report, however, that several passengers arriving at some of 
Brazil's international airports from Mexico and the United States 
complained of a lack of information and attention on and off the 
aircraft.  They complained that agents did not take any information 
from them, such as their name and address so as to be able to 
confirm later that they had not been infected, and that they 
received pamphlets that were only printed in Portuguese and not in 
English or Spanish.  In addition, pharmacies and drug stores have 
reportedly been inundated with people seeking to purchase flu 
medicines, sanitary gloves, and face masks. 
 
¶6.  (SBU) The governor of the State of Rio de Janeiro, Sergio 
Cabral, said on April 28 that there was little that Rio de Janeiro 
could do to prevent the virus from reaching the area.  Cabral stated 
that the State must create a much wider network of protection in 
order to create effective barriers to screen and handle the high 
influx of visitors and tourists that come into Rio de Janeiro, but 
that this would be a very difficult task for the State to handle.

DEVELOPMENTS WITH MISSION BRAZIL: 
 
¶7.  (SBU) Mission Brazil continues to monitor the status of its 
staff members and their families.  A working group tracks the travel 
of individuals coming to and from the Mission in order to ascertain 
whether they have visited areas where cases of H1N1 Flu have been 
confirmed.  Brazil-based officials from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Embassy officials maintain an extended hand of 
assistance towards the Brazilian Government and its health 
institutions.  They are in frequent contact with Brazilian health 
and government officials concerning the matter. 
 
¶8.  (SBU) COMMENT: Many of the specialists from the Brazilian Health 
Ministry who have been involved in handling the issue of H1N1 Flu in 
Brazil are graduates of or current participants in the CDC-supported 
Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP).  This FETP training has 
increased the efficiency and capacity of these health officials to 
deal with and prepare for the problems H1N1 Flu potentially 
presents, and it has enhanced the relationship and lines of 
communication between Mission personnel and the Brazilian 
Government.  The current situation illustrates how this training is 
paying off.  END COMMENT.
