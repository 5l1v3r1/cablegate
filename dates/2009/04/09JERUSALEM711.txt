Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al-Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida lead with news citing Israeli sources 
of a new "settlement" to be established in the Sawahrah neighborhood 
in East Jerusalem.  The new settlement would include 60 housing 
units for, "religious and extremist Jews" and was approved by the 
Jerusalem Municipality two months ago, according to coverage.  A 
Municipality spokesperson noted that the construction is not a 
settlement since it is on Municipality-owned land. Israeli peace 
movements are quoted commenting that settlement activities 
jeopardize the establishment of a Palestinian state.  In Palestinian 
Authority (PA) reaction, Al-Hayat Al-Jadida quotes PA officials 
warning Israel that the PA will raise the issue of Jerusalem 
settlement activities before the U.N. Security Council and urge both 
the Council and the international community to force a halt to all 
settlement activities, Israeli acceptance of the two-state solution 
and respect for signed agreements.  Al-Quds runs a lead graphic of a 
map of Jerusalem area settlements Maale Adumim, the Kidar 
settlements and Palestinian land identified by Israeli authorities 
to expand the three settlements. 
 
Al-Ayyam leads with an April 27 speech by Palestinian Authority (PA) 
President Abbas at a community event in Ramallah, confirming that 
the PA is in favor of negotiations with Israel based on the Arab 
Peace Initiative, the two-state solution, and the Roadmap.  All 
front pages cover the speech during which Abbas also noted that the 
PA will never recognize the "Jewish state" of Israel and is not 
involved with how Israel chooses to define itself, reporting 
concludes.  In other news, all front pages report on the opening of 
a new Palestinian Authority diplomatic mission in Caracas on April 
Â¶27. 
 
Al Ayyam and Al Quds run front page coverage about the U.S. 
administration requesting Congress to change laws to allow U.S. aid 
to a Palestinian unity government that could include Hamas-backed 
members.  The changes would require Hamas-backed members to commit 
to Middle East Quartet conditions, according to coverage.  The 
article cites passages from an April 27 LA Times story on the same 
topic. 
 
All front pages highlight swine flu news, with Al-Quds quoting 
President Obama noting that the flu should raise global concern, but 
not panic.  The report notes that 40 cases have been found so far in 
five U.S states.  Palestinian Authority Minister of Health Mughli 
notes that no cases of swine flu have been reported in the 
Palestinian Territories. 
 
Al-Quds' front page reports on the fourth round of "Palestinian 
national dialogue" that began in Cairo on April 27.  The first day 
did not result in any decisions or agreements on pending issues and 
will continue for the next four days, according to coverage. 
 
Al-Hayat Al-Jadida runs front page coverage of Palestinian 
Authority(PA) Premier Fayyad's comments that the PA will soon face a 
severe financial crisis if donor countries do not fulfill pledges. 
Speaking at an April 27 cabinet meeting, Fayyad highlighted that the 
PA will not be able to pay salaries in the West Bank and Gaza should 
there be a budget shortfall.

BLOCK QUOTES: 
-------------- 
 
1) Rimonda Tawil opines in Al-Quds independent daily under the 
 
JERUSALEM 00000711  002 OF 002 
 
 
title, "Obama's courageous position": (04/28) "The decision that 
U.S. President Obama has made to close Guantanamo and then open an 
investigation into violations committed there, clearly reflects a 
real change and new vision on the part of the new U.S. 
administration... such a presidential decision shows that the U.S., 
the strongest country in the world, can set an example for all world 
leaders that they should revise policies when they are proven to be 
wrong... in addition to Obama's courageous decision, he should now 
prove that he can translate decisions into action." 
 
2) Hafith Bargouthi opines in Al-Hayat Al Jadida official daily 
under the title, "Changes"(04/28):  "Jordanian King Abdullah is 
concerned that the regional situation, with no change on the ground, 
could lead to another war... and that regional peace will only be 
achieved through the intervention of Obama's administration.  This 
clearly indicates that King Abdullah believes that the new American 
diplomacy is capable of changing the status quo.  However, it must 
be coupled with a unified Palestinian position.  The factions who 
are talking in Cairo must also recognize that the region does not 
need another war and that they must act in the interest of the 
Palestinian people before admitting failure again."
