¶1. (SBU) The night of April 19, a fire broke out at UNAMID 
Headquarters in El Fasher causing millions of dollars worth of 
damage, UNAMID officials told poloff on April 21. UNAMID Public 
Information Chief Kemal Saiki told poloff that at approximately 
22:30 on April 10, a fire was detected at the UNAMID's 
Communications and Information Technology Services (CITS) Supply 
Warehouses on the ARC Compound which quickly spread to surrounding 
containers. UNAMID fire fighters eventually brought the fire under 
control and managed to extinguish it at approximately 02:30 on April 
¶20. No one was hurt in the incident, but 11 container offices and 
two warehouses were destroyed, causing an estimated $4 million worth 
of damage to IT and communications equipment and an additional $1 
million of damage to office furniture and other miscellaneous items. 
Saiki stated that a UN Special Investigative Unit (SIU) is 
investigating the incident, but that it appeared to be accidental 
and may have been sparked by an electrical short circuit. Wolfgang 
Weiszeggar, UNAMID's Deputy Director of Mission Support, stated that 
there have been no major operational interruptions as a result of 
the fire. An assessment will be made to establish priorities for 
replenishment of lost equipment, he said. 
 
¶2. (SBU) With regard to deployment, Weiszeggar noted that he had no 
information on the arrival of the Ethiopian attack helicopter 
contingent, noting that negotiations are being handled by UN 
Headquarters with the Ethiopian permanent mission in New York. UNHQ 
is also handling difficult negotiations for the self-deployment of 
the 2nd Ethiopian Battalion, he said, noting there are significant 
cost issues to be worked out. Weiszeggar had not heard anything new 
about the possibility of receiving military transport helicopters, 
stating that to his knowledge the UN is still waiting on pledges 
from TCCs. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Weiszeggar cited the latest UNAMID deployment figures as 
13,129 military personnel, 559 FPU personnel, and 1,742 individual 
police as of April 21. He noted that there was a ceiling of 1800 
imposed for individual police (as opposed to FPUs), but that the 
mission was looking at increasing this ceiling to 2100 starting in 
June. There are 3,445 civilian staff deployed, and several thousand 
individual contractors, many taken on after the departure of PAE. 
There are no planned incoming deployments in April, he said. In May, 
planned deployments include 3 Bangladeshi FPUs of 140 men each, a 
175 man Bangladeshi Sector Reserve Company, and a 35 man Bangladeshi 
Movecon Platoon. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Comment: The issue of reimbursement to Ethiopia for 
overland deployment is being negotiated in New York.  There is no 
question that overland deployment of the 2nd Ethiopian Battalion 
would be highly beneficial to UNAMID's operational capability; 
anything that can be done to advance this proposal would be very 
welcome by UNAMID. Military transport helicopters will be critical 
to UNAMID's Mobile Monitoring Team proposal (in order to be able to 
monitor a ceasefire or interim security arrangements that may be 
reached between the movements and the government in the coming 
months). Without military transport, UNAMID will be hard pressed to 
ascertain the facts and quickly cover potential flashpoints should 
an actual ceasefire be secured. End comment.
