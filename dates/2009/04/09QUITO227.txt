INCURSION, FARC TIES 
 
REF: A. QUITO 107 
     ¶B. QUITO 103 
 
Classified By: Ambassador Heather M. Hodges for Reasons 1.4 (b&d) 
 
¶1.  (C) SUMMARY:  The Correa government established a new 
commission to investigate the events surrounding the March 1, 
2008 Colombian bombing of a FARC camp in northern Ecuador, as 
well as allegations of GOE ties to the FARC.  The commission, 
whose members were chosen by Correa, will receive its funding 
from the GOE and likely guidance from Correa on its work, 
which will undoubtedly shape the result of its ultimate 
report.  The GOE will likely use the new commission to divert 
attention away from the accusations of FARC ties.  END 
SUMMARY. 
 
CORREA ESTABLISHES A COMMISSION TO INVESTIGATE BOMBING 
 
¶2.  (C) Correa signed a decree the week of March 11 
authorizing the formation of a Transparency and Truth 
Commission to investigate the Colombian bombing in Angostura 
(10 km south of Ecuador's northern border) on March 1, 2008, 
as well as the case of former Under Secretary of the Ministry 
of Government and Police, Ignacio Chauvin, and his alleged 
ties to narcotraffickers (Ref A).  The five members of the 
Commission were hand-selected by President Correa from a list 
of 35 proposed candidates, and include a representative each 
from the Council of Higher Education (CONESUP), the media, 
the Roman Catholic Church, indigenous organizations, and 
retired military. 
 
¶3.  (U) The Commission will begin its work on March 30, and 
will receive its funding from the GOE.  In its first 
meetings, the Commission will define its work plan and a 
budget.  The Commission is tasked with producing a report in 
five months that is to be delivered to President Correa on 
August 31 and shared with the public.  Initial results may be 
shared prior to releasing the report, but no earlier than 
April 26 so as not to influence the upcoming elections. 
 
¶4.  (C) Commission members already have begun to reveal their 
political bent.  One member, Francisco Huerta, questioned the 
term "narcopolitics," used by some reporters to refer to the 
Chauvin case and allegations of broader GOE ties to the FARC. 
 "We have some in the press who have enjoyed linking Ecuador 
with narcopolitics, and we've begun to lose prestige and this 
is serious...  With a topic of this magnitude and at a moment 
of international crisis in which we are living, we cannot 
play with such qualitative terms." 
 
COMMISSION ALREADY UNDER CRITICISM 
 
¶5.  (C) The announcement and formation of the Commission has 
drawn criticism, specifically that the members were selected 
by the President, that it will be financed by the Correa 
government, and that it will deliver its report directly to 
the President.  Former Minister of Government Mauricio 
Gandara said that such a commission that crosses into the 
responsibility of the judicial power was not appropriate, 
adding that the commission "could declare all those involved 
as innocent while the judges condemn them, and vice versa." 
The Democratic Agreement movement (which originally proposed 
such a commission) reportedly sent a letter on March 19 to 
Correa claiming that because of ties of the participants to 
the Correa government, the commission "does not meet the 
requirements of what would be a Truth Commission." 
 
¶6.  (C) During his March 21 weekly radio/TV address, 
President Correa defended the neutrality of the Commission, 
saying that he had asked NGOs and other social organizations 
that are not aligned with his government to propose 
candidates.  Correa asked the Commission to reveal the truth 
about three issues: 1) "If we (the GOE) knew something about 
the bombing, if this government has had any relation with the 
FARC, other than humanitarian actions for the liberation of 
Ingrid Betancourt, and if we knew about the (existence of) 
Angostura (FARC) camp;" 2) "analyze the Chauvin case; if it 
was manipulated politically;" and 3) "analyze the behavior of 
certain irresponsible press, because Ecuadorians cannot 
continue to be victims of corrupt, antipatriotic, (and) 
 
mediocre journalism that does not mind hurting the country if 
it can hurt President Correa and the government of the 
citizen revolution."  Correa did not mention that the 
Commission would investigate the Latin American Association 
of Human Rights (ALDHU), as had previously been discussed. 
ALDHU is an NGO where Chauvin had worked that is accused of 
acting in support of the FARC in northern Ecuador (Ref B). 
Correa added the task of analyzing the behavior of the press. 
 
AND YET ANOTHER COMMISSION? 
 
¶7.  (C) Retired Colonel and military analyst Patricio Haro, 
one of the harshest critics of the commission Correa 
appointed, is leading the formation of a separate commission, 
also with the purpose of investigating the events surrounding 
the bombing in Angostura.  On March 23, he said that, "this 
alternative commission will give the country the truth about 
Angostura, in an independent and technical manner.  It will 
have a moral solvency, as it will not have political ties to 
the (Correa) government."  Haro claims to have spoken with 
potential contributors, although it remains unclear as to how 
this commission will be financed. 
 
CONTROVERSIAL DEATH OF PROSECUTOR KEY TO INVESTIGATION OF 
ANGOSTURA 
 
¶8.  (C) While the GOE pursues investigation of the bombing 
through the commission created by Correa, the Prosecuting 
Attorney's investigation of the case has suffered a setback. 
The Chief Prosecutor for the provinces of Sucumbios and 
Orellana, Wilmer Gonzabay, who was in charge of the 
investigation of the Angostura bombing, died on February 23, 
reportedly from a heart attack.  Gonzabay had ordered the 
detention of Mexican Lucia Morett and two other Colombian 
survivors of the March 2008 attack, but only after the three 
quietly had left Ecuador.  Gonzabay claimed to have proof 
that the Ecuadorian military arrived at the site of the 
bombing only a few hours after it occurred and conferred with 
its Colombian counterparts.  In an order to the 
Superintendent of Banks, Gonzabay requested financial 
information on several military personnel and deceased 
Ecuadorian FARC member Franklin Aisalla.  Prosecutor General 
Washington Pesantez ordered an investigation into Gonzabay's 
death after the press questioned how he could have died in a 
bordello during hours that it should have been closed to the 
public.  At this point, it is unclear how the Prosecutor 
General's investigation of the bombing will proceed. 
 
COMMENT 
 
¶9.  (C) The Truth and Transparency Commission, with its GOE 
funding and direct influence by President Correa in its 
formation and definition, is a political maneuver to 
influence the political debate over the GOE's alleged ties to 
the FARC and the events surrounding Angostura.  The 
Commission could blame the U.S. for Angostura and repeat 
previous accusations of infiltration and inference in 
Ecuadorian sovereign affairs.  The Commission's findings 
could also conflict with those of the Prosecutor General's 
office, which would complicate further any existing 
investigations or legal action in an already challenged legal 
system.
