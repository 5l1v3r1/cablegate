SUBJECT: IRAQI MEDIA REACTION: PRESIDENT OBAMA'S VISIT TO IRAQ 
 
¶1. (U) Summary:  Iraqi media outlets called President Obama's April 
7, 2009, visit to Baghdad an opportunity to stress the significance 
of the next 18 months leading to the withdrawal of U.S. combat 
forces from Iraq and to reaffirm his commitment to implement the 
U.S.-Iraq Security and Strategic Framework Agreements.  News 
coverage of events was prominent and straightforward as details of 
the surprise visit unfolded on TV and the wire services.  Outlets 
noted that the trip to Iraq marked Obama's first visit as president 
to an Arab state.  Iraq's traditional Sunni TV channel called 
attention to the President's remarks on the need for more political 
reform and reconciliation in Iraq.  End summary.

Focus on Bilateral Issues 
------------------------- 
 
¶2. (U) Iraqi media highlighted the President's meetings with Iraqi 
leaders and their discussions on the withdrawal of U.S. forces from 
Iraq, the current security situation, and Arab-Kurd issues.  They 
underscored the President's remarks to fully implement the U.S.-Iraq 
Security and Strategic Framework Agreements.  Several outlets also 
aired live the President and Prime Minister's joint remarks.  Iraqi 
print and wire services echoed these themes. 
 
--------------------------------------------- - 
Sunni and Other Outlets Note Call for Political Reconciliation 
-------------- 
 
¶3. (U) A secondary emphasis stressed by several outlets was Obama's 
call for more political reform and reconciliation in Iraq.  The 
secular opposition Al-Sharqiya TV channel led its coverage of the 
visit with Obama's remark calling for Iraq to reach equitable 
solutions to outstanding issues among its political parties, noting 
that the President endorsed national reconciliation.  In commentary, 
the Sunni channel said that the President's remarks are an 
indication that the administration's patience is "wearing thin" 
regarding the GOI's delay in integrating Iraq's security forces and 
state institutions.  Al-Hurra TV and the pan-Arab daily Al-Sharq 
Al-Awsat echoed this theme. 
 
-------------------------------------- 
First Visit as President to Arab State 
-------------------------------------- 
 
¶4. (U) Nearly all Iraqi TV, print and Internet media noted in 
particular that the trip to Iraq marked Obama's first visit as 
president to an Arab state. Outlets mentioned that a dust storm 
prevented the President from traveling into central Baghdad as 
originally planned.  Many newspapers that had earlier deadlines 
erroneously reported that President Obama spoke to Iraqi leaders by 
telephone. However, the TV channels correctly reported that the 
meetings took place in person at Camp Victory. 
 
5.(U) Comment: Not surprisingly, Iraqi media coverage of the 
President's visit focused on the bilateral relationship and had less 
focus on his meeting with American troops in Iraq. End comment.
