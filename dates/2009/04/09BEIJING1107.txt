  Editorial Quotes

¶1. AMERICAN NETWORK SECURITY 
 
"American 'Network War Command Office' is set up to control the 
network power [and security of the U.S.]" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(04/24): "The Wall Street Journal reported 
that the Obama administration is planning to set up a new military 
command office, the network war command office.' The report also 
indicted that the office will reallocate the U.S. military's efforts 
in protecting their networks from being attacked by hackers, 
especially those from China and Russia. Interestingly, the new 
command office of network security is being announced at the same 
time as recent media reports concerning the hacking against the U.S. 
by China and Russia.  This coincidence brings doubts concerning the 
U.S. media's motives. Chinese analysts have said that certain 
network attacks are the efforts of individuals. But now, the U.S. is 
treating their network strategy equal to their nuclear strategy. 
This will undoubtedly threaten the peace and development of the 
international society. The aggressive stance of the U.S.' network 
security is an action of deterrence against other countries' cyber 
attacks." 
 
¶2. TAIWAN 
 
"The U.S. needs to gradually step away from Cross-Strait affairs" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(04/24): "The two sides of the Taiwan Strait 
have reached the conclusion that they are committed to facing the 
future and pursuing peace, and therefore that the U.S.' role in 
Cross-Strait affairs should gradually become less important. For the 
past year, all parties have benefitted. This beneficial trend is due 
to the decreasing U.S. role in Cross-Strait affairs. Taiwan has 
always been a strategic chess piece for the U.S. The U.S. will not 
easily let it go. However, the role of a chess piece is becoming 
less important. The U.S. intent to use its chess pieces to maintain 
balance is becoming harder. U.S.-Taiwan policy is at a critical 
moment of adjustment. Because it is facing a different Asia from 
Cold War time, the U.S. must adjust its Asia strategy. The U.S. 
should not act as an obstacle in the process of China's unification, 
even if it fits the U.S.' strategic interests." 
 
¶3. U.S. POLICY 
 
"Obama's nuclear policy is a good policy" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(04/24): "Obama's stance on nuclear issues is 
a manifestation of his ability as a president and greatly matters to 
the national security of the U.S. Shortly after taking office, Obama 
gingerly expressed that the U.S. does not support deploying an 
anti-missile system in both Poland and the Czech Republic. Obama 
emphasizes an ethic and moral image of the U.S.  The leading 
position of the U.S. in nuclear and weapons technology has been 
useful in guaranteeing that the U.S. is a global super power. In 
fact the theory that Obama now advocates is that one should throw 
away the burden of nuclear weapons. However, these tactical nuclear 
weapons are the true strategic foundation of the U.S. military. The 
U.S. will be the last country to remove their nuclear weapons. In 
fact, Obama's stance on this issue does not differ from Bush's 
stance at all."
