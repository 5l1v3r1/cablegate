Summary 
------- 
¶1. On April 3, the Ministry of Defense announced a strengthening of 
its ISAF mission to Afghanistan by 40 troops.  Additionally, the 
military will deploy a C-130 for operations in Afghanistan from May 
to September.  End Summary. 
 
Strengthening ISAF Mission 
-------------------------- 
¶2. On April 3, the Ministry of Defense announced Sweden will 
increase its 375 troops in Mazar-i-Sharif by 40.  (Note: Sweden 
plans to increase total troop levels to 500 by the end of 2009.  End 
note.)  A MoD official told Post that the 40 troops should be 
operative by late April.  The increase is to improve the PRT's 
ability to guard, escort and patrol the PRT's four provinces leading 
up to and during the August elections. 
 
Deploying the C-130 
------------------- 
¶3. On April 8, the Swedish Armed Forces announced plans to deploy a 
C-130 for ISAF use, including a 20 person detail.  The C-130 should 
be operative by May 15 and the unit is planning for 80 flight hours 
monthly until the mission ends in mid-September.  The C-130 will be 
available for ISAF use throughout Afghanistan, but the Swedish 
military retains the ability to opt-out of missions if it deems the 
threat level too high.
