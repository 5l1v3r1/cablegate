SUBJECT: UKRAINE: RINAT AKHMETHOV BUYS U.S. COAL COMPANY 
 
¶1. (SBU) Metinvest, Ukrainian oligarch Rinat Akhmetov's 
metallurgical company, confirmed local media reports that it 
has purchased West Virginia based United Coal.  Metinvest 
will announce the purchase later on April 30 in the U.S., 
Jock Mendoza-Wilson, investor relations chief of Akhmetov's 
SCM Holding, told us.  Mendoza-Wilson said Metinvest would 
not disclose the sales price, which Ukrainian media reports 
put at roughly $1 to $1.4 billion. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Mendoza-Wilson said the transaction, which had been 
announced previously and received U.S. regulatory permission, 
would make Metinvest 100 percent self-sufficient in coking 
coal.  The lack of metallurgical coal resources had placed 
the company at a disadvantage to other, vertically integrated 
eastern European steel producers, Mendoza-Wilson told us. 
Direct access to coal would help the company in times of 
volatile prices, tight liquidity or shortages of adequate 
coal supplies on the world market, he added. 
 
¶3. (SBU) The planned purchase had not been deterred by the 
world financial crisis and the severe drop in Ukrainian steel 
output, which, Mendoza-Wilson conceded, had hit Metinvest 
hard.  He indicated that the crisis did put downward pressure 
on the purchase price.  Metinvest paid outright for the 
purchase, he said, through a mixture of company cash and 
borrowings, which he said the company was able to acquire on 
account of agreements with banks dating from before the 
economic crisis began. 
 
¶4. (SBU) Mendoza-Wilson also said that the purchase was part 
of a strategic decision by Akhmetov's SCM group to establish 
a significant presence in the U.S. market.  SCM hopes to 
leverage the purchase to increase its name recognition in the 
U.S., and to access more U.S. sources of financing for future 
expansion.  He also said that the acquisition of a U.S. based 
mining company also made sense from a narrower commercial 
perspective.  Although coal is cheaper elsewhere, United 
Coal, with operations in Kentucky, West Virginia and 
Virginia, was  among the world's most efficient mining 
companies.  SCM also wanted to invest in an environment with 
high corporate governance standards.  He mentioned in 
particular sanctity of contract, clear title and ownership 
rights, and strict health and safety rules for the mines as 
factors that made the acquisition of a U.S. coal mining 
company particularly attractive for SCM.
