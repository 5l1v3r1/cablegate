Title- How many Gs will make the world? 
 
Op-ed in liberal Folha de S.Paulo (4-8) by Clovis Rossi says "....In 
all this analysis [of how many countries will lead the world from 
now on 2, 4, 8, 20]....the main assumption is some decrease in U.S. 
influence.  [But] any G with more than one country only makes sense 
if we remember that today, what counts is G1, the U.S., as the only 
remaining superpower...without devaluing any future hypothesis on G 
numbers, I stick with Jose Luis Fiori (from the Federal University 
in Rio de Janeiro) in 'The myth of the collapse of U.S. power': 
'this relative decline of the U.S. does not mean a collapse of its 
economic power nor the end of its global supremacy.'" 
 
Title- Crisis Policy 
 
Op-ed in center-right O Estado de S.Paulo (4-8) by former Ambassador 
to France and former Minister of Development, Industry and Trade, 
Sergio Amaral, states "The G20 Summit evidenced...that the first 
global crisis had in its core a new economic geography.  The U.S. 
will continue to be a dominant economic power....but its relative 
weight is already lower....Its strategic challenge, as for Europe, 
is to accommodate China's emergence - first economic, which we are 
already seeing, and then, political...."
