REF: STATE 868 
 
Â¶1.  (SBU) Embassy confirms notification of the Ecuadorian 
military of the denial of license application 050128842 for 
the export of spare parts of MK 46 Mod 2 torpedoes.  The 
Embassy spoke initially with the Head of Ecuadorian Navy 
Logistics, Captain Pablo Gordillo, in January and followed up 
with a written notification to the Ecuadorian Navy that the 
foreign intermediate consignee Commerce International Group 
Ltd. (CIG Ltd.) was not an approved recipient of United 
States Munitions List items and would not be a party to any 
defense trade transaction subject to control under the 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR).  Embassy 
clarified that an export request for the same requested items 
would be considered favorably if supported by a direct 
purchase order with the U.S. applicant of the case, with 
another U.S. supplier or a foreign consignee that was an 
approved recipient.  Captain Gordillo said he was aware of 
the case and that the Ecuadorian Navy would pursue an 
alternate form of purchase.  Gordillo told the Embassy on 
April 17 that the Ecuadorian Navy was still looking for 
another foreign consignee.
