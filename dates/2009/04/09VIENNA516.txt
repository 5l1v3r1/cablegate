Classified By: ECONPOL Counselor J. Dean Yap. Reason: 1.5(b)

¶1. (S) SUMMARY: Neither the GoA nor Andritz (the Austrian manufacturer in question) know of any sale/transfer of nuclear-industry relevant pumps to Iranian clients. END SUMMARY.

¶2. (S) EconChief delivered reftel demarche April 28 to interlocutors in Austrias Economic Ministry and Foreign Ministry. MinEcon and MFA representatives acknowledged the seriousness of allegations that an Austrian company (Andritz AG) would make available to Iranian clients any technology that could be subverted to promote Irans covert nuclear program. MinEcon also expressed concern about the alleged role of a sham end-user (Irans Surena Company), but pointed out that Andritz might not be obligated to apply for a license, since the pumps in question were not controlled under the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG).

¶3. (S) Later on April 28, a MinEcon representative (Hans Schramml) contacted EconChief with an interim reply: -- Andritz representatives say that the company has no dealings with Surena, nor with ESNICO/SNIKO. -- Andritz has not sold centrifugal pumps to any Iranian clients, nor have there been expressions of interest by Iranian customers -- The GoA requests any additional information the USG can provide to help identify the suspected transaction -- was a third party or third country involved?

¶4. (S) In a follow-up conversation on April 30, Schramml reported that: -- Andritz has certified to the GoA in writing that it knows of no sale/transfer of nuclear-industry relevant pumps to Iranian clients (nor any solicited business), including centrifugal pumps and cooling-system pumps. -- the GoA has flagged Surena as a "red-category" end-user in its export control approval process, meaning any future sales to Surena would likely be refused. -- the GoA cautioned Andritz to watch for third parties (such as in the U.A.E.) who might act as intermediaries in such a sale.

The MinEcon representative opined that Andritz representatives are very diligent in their compliance efforts, based on the GoAs experience so far, and noted that Andritz sells primarily to paper/pulp manufacturers in Iran.
