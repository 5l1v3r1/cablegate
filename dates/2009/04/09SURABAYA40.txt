¶1. The Ahmadiyah representative in Lombok told Congen April 24 
that the head of the Ketapang district office visited the 
Transito camp on April 14 to request the Ahmadis once again 
delay their return to their homes in the Gegerungan Village in 
West Lombok Regency for security reasons. The official also 
argued that the Ahmadi's return should be delayed until the 
compensation and relocation plan has been developed with the 
local government. 
 
 
 
¶2. The 17-member Coordination Team, established in February 2009 
by the Nusa Tenggara Barat provincial government, have been 
discussing two options for the Ahmadis:  (1) relocate the 
Ahmadis to Pemenang district of West Lombok, or (2) relocate the 
Ahmadis to city-owned land. Adhar Hakim, from the NGO Somasi, 
told us that the local government's plan is to spread the 
Ahmadis throughout society instead of putting them in one 
location. However, according to the Ahmadiyah representative, 
both options are impossible and complicated.  The Ahmadis are 
concerned that spreading out their community in Pemenang 
district, a multi-religious area, will increase the security 
threat, while the city-owned land is mostly in disputed areas 
and located in open green space areas. 
 
 
 
¶3. The Ahmadis in Transito camp decided to return to their home 
village gradually rather than wait for the local government to 
develop a plan. Their desire to return home is larger than their 
nervousness about the security situation. So far, four families 
have returned home. According to the Ahmadis, these four 
families are now living and working safely within the local 
community, although they report receiving minor intimidation 
from local people.
