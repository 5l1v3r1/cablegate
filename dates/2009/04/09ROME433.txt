SUBJECT: PIRACY: ITALY REQUESTS ASSISTANCE FOR ANTI-PIRACY 
OPERATION 
 
REF: WASLEY-JESTER-SADOWSKA EMAILS 4-15-09 
 
Classified By: Charge d'Affaires a.i. Elizabeth Dibble for 
Reasons 1.4 (B) and (D) 

¶1. (S)  The Government of Italy sent U.S. Embassy Rome an 
unclassified Note Verbale on April 16 thanking the USG for 
assistance provided thus far in the deployment of Italian 
Special Forces to Djibouti for possible use in an anti-piracy 
mission and requesting continuing assistance as needed.  The 
note, sent in unclassified channels to speed up the process, 
was generated in response to our requirement that any further 
USG assistance in support of the Italian anti-piracy mission 
be requested via Diplomatic Note. 

¶2. (S) Background: The Italian-owned and flagged tugboat 
Buccaneer was taken by pirates in the Gulf of Aden on April 
¶11.  The ship has 16 crew members on board: 10 Italian, 5 
Romanian, and 1 Croatian, and is currently about one nautical 
mile from the coast of Somalia.  The Italian military has 
requested permission from the Government of Djibouti and 
Combined Joint Task Force-Horn of Africa (CJTF-HOA) to use 
Camp Lemonier in Djibouti as a logistical staging area in 
preparation for a possible rescue mission.  The GOI assures 
us that it has obtained all the necessary landing permits 
from the Government of Djibouti.  It has already landed one 
aircraft in Djibouti with approximately 29 logistical support 
staff, currently housed at Camp Lemonier, to prepare for the 
staging.  The mission, if it happens, will not/not be 
launched from Djiboutian soil, and the GOI is currently 
considering other options that do not entail a rescue 
mission.  Italy may use its Frigate MAESTRALE, currently 
deployed to the region as part of EU operation ATALANTA, and 
which is currently shadowing the pirates, to launch the 
operation, or may make use of other vessels.  Italy may 
request helicopter, intel, and other logistical support from 
the U.S. as the need arises, but currently its request is 
limited to logistical support to house units at Camp 
Lemonier. 

¶3. (S) Post has stressed to the GOI the need to provide as 
many details as possible about the potential operation in a 
timely manner, as well as the need to coordinate fully with 
the Government of Djibouti.  The Defense Attache is in 
contact with the Italian Military and Poloffs are in contact 
with the MFA Operations Center as the situation evolves, and 
will provide additional operational details as they become 
available. 
 
¶4. (SBU) The translated text of the Note is as follows 
(Italian original will be emailed to EUR/WE):

"Ministry of Foreign Affairs 
 
Rome, 4/16/2009 
Prot. 0129432 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Italy 
presents its compliments to the Embassy of the United States 
of America and, in consideration of our shared efforts in the 
fight against terrorism and piracy, has the honor to express 
its full appreciation for the assistance provided to the 
"Training Mission" sent to Djibouti. 
 
The sending of the mission, as well as the deployment of the 
Italian Frigate "MAESTRALE," forms part of the efforts 
undertaken by the Government of Italy in the struggle against 
piracy. 
 
While noting that the Authorities of Djibouti have provided 
the necessary visas and aircraft landing authorizations, the 
Italian Government is particularly grateful to the Government 
of the United States of America for having hosted this 
mission at Camp Lemonier.  The Italian Government, in 
addition, is grateful to the Government of the United States 
of America henceforth for any further assistance that it 
might provide in the future. 
 
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in expressing its full 
gratitude for the collaboration, takes the opportunity to 
extend to the Embassy of the United States of America 
reassurances of its highest consideration."
