¶1.  (SBU)  Summary:  As of April 20, there were thirteen 
trafficking-related convictions in Canada in 2008-2009, with 
an additional twelve cases now before the courts.  Ongoing 
investigations, including alleged cases of forced labor and 
trafficking of foreign victims, should lead to additional 
charges in the coming months.  Canada also devotes 
significant resources to prevention strategies.  Its 
commitment to combating human trafficking is commendable. 
End summary. 
 
PROSECUTION 
----------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU)   On April 20, the Department of Foreign Affairs 
and International Trade (DFAIT) and the Department of Justice 
provided updated information for the 2009 Trafficking In 
Persons report (ref a).  Trafficking convictions in April of 
traffickers in Gatineau, Quebec, (ref b) and Toronto (ref c) 
brought the total number in 2008-2009 to 13, including five 
specifically for human trafficking, and eight for 
trafficking-related offenses.  These cases involved 13 
offenders and at least 21 victims.  In nine cases, the 
offenders received prison sentences ranging from nine months 
to eight years. 
 
¶3.  (SBU)  An additional 12 cases involving 15 accused 
individuals and at least 16 complainants remain before the 
courts.  DFAIT and Justice officials predicted additional 
charges will result in the coming months from ongoing law 
enforcement investigations, some of which involve allegations 
of trafficking for forced labor and trafficking of foreign 
victims. 
 
PREVENTION 
---------- 
 
¶4.  (U) On April 6, the federal government announced the 
first-ever grant to combat trafficking of aboriginal women 
and children (ref e).  The government will provide C$100,000 
to the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs to develop education and 
awareness programs to protect First Nations women and youth 
from trafficking and sexual exploitation.  The grant 
supplements the federal government's partnership with the 
Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC) on the five-year 
"Sisters In Spirit" initiative (2005-2010) to prevent 
violence in aboriginal communities. 
 
¶5.  (SBU)  The Interdepartmental Working Group of 17 federal 
departments and agencies has met regularly to strengthen 
Canada's actions against trafficking generally, as well as to 
coordinate specifically with British Columbia provincial 
authorities to prepare for the 2010 Winter Olympic Games. 
British Columbia's Office to Combat Trafficking collaborates 
closely with federal law enforcement agencies.  The Royal 
Canadian Mounted Police's Human Trafficking National 
Coordination Center and its regional coordinators across 
Canada continue to combat trafficking through investigations, 
training, and prevention efforts.  Over fifty Canada Border 
Services Agency (CBSA) officers posted around the world work 
to identify and intercept potential TIP victims as they try 
to head to Canada. 
 
¶6.  (SBU)  Canada issued only 14 work permits to exotic 
dancers in 2008, down from 15 permits in 2007 and 22 permits 
in 2006.  The Department of Citizenship and Immigration 
provided Canadian diplomatic missions overseas as well as 
permit recipients with information sheets on dancers' rights 
and contact numbers for support organizations in Canada. 
 
¶7.  (SBU)  Comment:  Canada remains seriously committed to 
combating human trafficking in all its manifestations, using 
preventive tactics whenever possible and increasing its legal 
prosecutions of offenders in Canada.  The first-ever 
convictions in 2008-2009 under Criminal Code amendments 
Qconvictions in 2008-2009 under Criminal Code amendments 
passed in 2005 (Section 279.01-279.04) that specifically 
prohibit human trafficking are especially notable and welcome 
precedents.
