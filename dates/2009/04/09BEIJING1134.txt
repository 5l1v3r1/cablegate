  Editorial Quotes

¶1. U.S.-CHINA-JAPAN RELATIONS 
 
"China and Japan should alleviate the U.S. influence in their 
countries' future development" 
 
The official Communist Party international news publication Global 
Times (Huanqiu Shibao)(04/28): "The Japanese Prime Minister will 
visit China soon. This brings attention to the development of the 
bilateral relationship between the two countries. The two countries 
have both developed independently. China is gradually moving past 
the 'American conceptual restrictions' that exist in the country, 
especially after the results of the financial crisis.  China's 
de-Americanization is gaining speed.  Japan's de- Japan's 
de-Americanization is speeding up as well.  Japan is likely to 
discard the U.S. completely and take steps closer to its East Asian 
neighbor countries. The U.S. should not encourage Japan to develop 
its military strength. U.S. interference will be an important factor 
to overcome if China-Japan relations intend to develop maturely. 
China should change their old thinking that U.S.-China relations are 
more important than China-Japan relations. In fact, the significance 
of the China-Japan relationship has also globalized, and is not 
limited to Asia. China and Japan should seek more breakthroughs in 
global cooperation. The two countries should contribute more in the 
development of the world." 
 
¶2. U.S. POLICY 
 
"Obamaism is not yet fully formed" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(04/28): "Obama has just become president. During 
his first 100 days in office, the concepts of Obamaism have 
frequently appeared. Obamaism is characterized by the fact that the 
Obama administration is aware that the U.S. cannot solve so many 
international issues by itself.  It is very different from Bush's 
cowboy diplomacy.  However, Obamaism hasn't fully formed and it is 
facing challenges. People doubt that Obama will make any 
breakthroughs in the core strategic interests and values of the U.S. 
It is doubtful that he will give up the country's long-term pursuit 
of hegemony. Obama once stated that he would reshape the global 
leadership of the U.S. This shows that the U.S. does not intend to 
be an equal partner in international communications. The U.S. also 
struggles with the variant nature of its policies. One can gain 
insight from the U.S. Cuba policy. However, people can still be 
hopeful." 
 
¶3. CHINA'S GOLD RESERVES 
 
"China increases its gold reserves in order to kill two birds with 
one stone" 
 
The China Radio International sponsored newspaper World News Journal 
(Shijie Xinwenbao)(04/28): "According to China's National Foreign 
Exchanges Administration China 's gold reserves have recently 
increased. Currently, the majority of its gold reserves have been 
located in the U.S. and European countries. The U.S. and Europe have 
always suppressed the rising price of gold. They intend to weaken 
gold's function as an international reserve currency. They don't 
want to see other countries turning to gold reserves instead of the 
U.S. dollar or Euro. Therefore, suppressing the price of gold is 
very beneficial for the U.S. in maintaining the U.S. dollar's role 
as the international reserve currency. China's increased gold 
reserves will thus act as a model and lead other countries towards 
reserving more gold. Large gold reserves are also beneficial in 
promoting the internationalization of the RMB."
