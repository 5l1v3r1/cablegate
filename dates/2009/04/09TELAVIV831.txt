SUBJECT: ISRAEL MEDIA REACTION 
 
-------------------------------- 
SUBJECTS COVERED IN THIS REPORT: 
-------------------------------- 
 
¶1.  Mideast 
 
¶2.  Iran 
 
------------------------- 
Key stories in the media: 
------------------------- 
 
All media cited Iranian President Mahmoud AhmadinejadQs announcement 
yesterday that his country has made great strides in uranium fuel 
production and uranium enrichment.  HaQaretz and Israel Radio 
reported that Israel does not object to talks between the West and 
Iran intended to stop Iran's nuclearization, as long as Iran does 
not take advantage of these talks.  Maariv, which bannered President 
ObamaQs call for a dialogue with Iran, quoted an Israeli defense 
source as saying that Israel expects a time-limit to talks with 
Iran. 
 
All media reported that Egypt is holding 49 nationals of various 
Arab countries on suspicion of being members of a 
Hizbullah-controlled terrorist network. Israel Radio cited a denial 
that Israeli Arabs were implicated in the network, as had been 
published previously.  The accused have allegedly planned to carry 
out attacks inside Egypt, including tourist sites frequented by 
Israelis 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that Quartet envoy Tony Blair intervened 
directly with DM Ehud Barak to enable Northern Ireland politician 
Gerry Adams through the Erez Crossing and into the Gaza Strip on 
Wednesday, where he met Hamas PM Ismail Haniyeh,   Citing news 
agencies, HaQaretz quoted Adams as saying that Gaza is an Qopen-air 
prison. 
 
Leading media reported that yesterday President Obama and his wife 
Michelle hosted a private Passover Seder in the White House, 
fulfilling a campaign-trail promise he made a year ago.  This is the 
first time a U.S. president ever held such a ceremony.  The 
Jerusalem Post reported that the President described JewsQ ascent 
from slavery to freedom as Qamong the most powerful stories of 
suffering and redemption in human history.Q   Israel Radio saw it as 
a kind of counterweight to ObamaQs call to the Muslim world in 
remarks he made in Turkey. 
 
The Jerusalem Post reported that on Wednesday Ambassador Jeffrey 
Feltman was nominated by President Obama to replace David Welch as 
the top U.S. diplomat on the Middle East. 
 
Maariv reported that over the weekend British Foreign Secretary 
David Miliband conveyed to Israel the message that Jerusalem must 
become the capital of Israel and Palestine. 
 
Media reported that on Wednesday settlers from Bat Ayin entered the 
Palestinian village of Tsafa, where clashes erupted.  Sixteen to 38 
Palestinians and a settler were wounded. 
 
HaQaretz (English Ed.) reported that this week pro-Palestinian 
activists launched a fundraising drive to cover hospital costs for 
Tristan Anderson, an uninsured American protester critically wounded 
last month by police in the West Bank.  Meanwhile his family is 
preparing to sue Israel. 
 
Leading media reported that 30 northern Israel residents are suing 
North Korea and Hizbullah for $100 million in a Washington court for 
damage sustained from Katyusha rockets. 
 
Media reported that on Wednesday PM Benjamin Netanyahu told Italian 
PM Silvio Berlusconi that Israel would aid earthquake-stricken 
Italy.  The remains of an Israeli-Arab killed in the earthquake were 
returned to Israel over the holiday.

Summary: 
-------- 
 
Military correspondent Amos Harel and Palestinian affairs 
correspondent Avi Issacharoff wrote in the independent, left-leaning 
HaQaretz: QTo fight Iranian subversion in Egypt, Cairo is willing to 
help Israel prevent the arming of Hamas in the Gaza Strip.... The 
report of Hizbullah actions in Sinai legitimizes harsher steps by 
the Egyptian regime. 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote in the mass-circulation 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot: QThe President of the U.S. will not 
pressure the Prime Minister beyond the boundaries of his coalition's 
flexibility.  That was true of Clinton and true of Bush, and judging 
by Obama's question, holds true now. 
 
Shaul Arieli, a former chief Israeli negotiator with the 
Palestinians and an architect of the Geneva Initiative, wrote in 
HaQaretz: QAnnapolis and Oslo once again made clear the gap that 
moderates and pragmatists on both sides can bridge.  These processes 
underscored that what is truly needed is the ability to carry out an 
agreement. 
 
Conservative Op-Ed Page Editor Ben-Dror Yemini wrote in the popular, 
pluralist Maariv: QEgypt is displeased -- and justly so -- over 
several infuriating statements issued by the foreign minister, 
Avigdor Lieberman.  It is about time that the Foreign Ministry 
summoned the Egyptian ambassador to Israel to voice its protest for 
the insolent anti-Semitism being expressed by this senior Egyptian 
official.

¶I.   QInside Netanyahu's Head 
 
Senior columnist Nahum Barnea wrote in the mass-circulation 
pluralist Yediot Aharonot (4/10): QThe most important conversation 
that [Netanyahu] had since entering [his] new position was with 
Barack Obama.  The conversation was good, friendly, with a potential 
for good chemistry.  The most important sentence that was uttered 
was a question that Obama asked: What are your political 
limitations?  In other words, how much flexibility will your 
right-wing coalition allow you?  The President of the U.S. will not 
pressure the Prime Minister beyond the boundaries of his coalition's 
flexibility.  That was true of Clinton and true of Bush, and judging 
by Obama's question, holds true now.  Lieberman, in his heated 
speeches, caused a great deal of damage to the image of the 
government and the state. There is no doubt that Netanyahu is angry 
with him.  However, Netanyahu cannot ignore the advantages: 
Lieberman lowers the world's expectations for Israeli concessions. 
The main thing is that he clarified that the only address for 
diplomacy is the Prime Minister's Bureau... If I were Netanyahu, I 
would say that negotiations with the Palestinians must take place, 
but will not result in a state.  The Israelis are not the only ones 
who have given up on the Palestinians. So have the Americans.  The 
speeches about two states for two peoples are only speeches.  That 
also goes for Syria.  American cannot get much from Syria except for 
a feeling of accomplishment.  Israel cannot get much either.  We 
need to concentrate on the Arab world.  That is the main 
significance of negotiations with the Palestinians: softening 
opposition to Israel within the Arab world. We have a common 
interest with the Arab regimes: to convince the U.S. that there is 
no alternative to taking action against Iran.  Iran is the main 
thing.  One could almost say that it is the most important thing. 
Netanyahu's main partner, his support in the government and facing 
the world, is Ehud Barak.  Over the past several weeks, Netanyahu 
heard everyone in the know telling him: Barak will subvert you.  He 
disagreed with them.  Barak with thirteen Knesset members-actually, 
with seven-is not the same Barak.  He knows his limits. 
 
II.  "ItQs About Iran" 
 
Military correspondent Amos Harel and Palestinian affairs 
correspondent Avi Issacharoff wrote in the independent, left-leaning 
HaQaretz (4/10): QThe official report from Cairo Thursday -- that a 
Hizbullah terror ring was uncovered in Cairo and was planning 
hostile operations in Egypt -- should be seen within the context of 
a greater conflict that does not necessarily involve Israel.  To 
fight Iranian subversion in Egypt, Cairo is willing to help Israel 
prevent the arming of Hamas in the Gaza Strip.... Ironically, Cairo 
is making its accusations against Iran just as the Obama 
administration is inviting dialogue.  But Egypt cannot hold still. 
Cairo arrests dozens of Muslim Brotherhood members every month on 
terror suspicions.  Since Hamas's final takeover of the Strip, 
Brotherhood and Hamas delegations visit each other every few 
weeks.... The report of Hizbullah actions in Sinai legitimizes 
harsher steps by the Egyptian regime.  If it were only a matter of 
weapons smuggling into Israel, the Egyptian public response would 
not be as supportive.  It would come as no surprise if it turned out 
that Israeli intelligence also helped uncover this terror network. 
 
III.  "Bridging the Gap" 
 
Shaul Arieli, a former chief Israeli negotiator with the 
Palestinians and an architect of the Geneva Initiative, wrote in 
HaQaretz (4/10):Q Is it true Israeli leaders went very far out of 
their way to meet the Palestinians, who got cold feet at the moment 
of truth?  Or did Barak and Olmert set out to pressure the 
Palestinians after they had shown a willingness to compromise on a 
two-state solution instead of their dream of a Qsingle Palestine 
and the alleged right of return?  Even though the Palestinians' 
basic positions are supported by resolutions and international law, 
they proved their willingness to show flexibility in many areas. 
They did this to align their positions with Israeli governments' 
ability to carry out an agreement in light of the settlements in the 
West Bank and East Jerusalem.... All the same, the Palestinians have 
always viewed an agreement as a package deal: If they concede on one 
issue, they should be compensated on another.  Olmert, like Barak, 
tried to shatter the formula of total territorial concessions for 
peace that determined Israel's deals with Egypt and Jordan.... 
Annapolis and Oslo once again made clear the gap that moderates and 
pragmatists on both sides can bridge.  These processes underscored 
that what is truly needed is the ability to carry out an 
agreement. 
 
IV.  QBlood and Matzo, Nothing Has Changed 
 
Conservative Op-Ed Page Editor Ben-Dror Yemini wrote in the popular, 
pluralist Maariv (4/10): QThere is always someone out there to 
explain how Jews are drinking the blood of gentiles.  And if we 
thought this was something of the past 
-- then we were wrong.  The march of incitement continues.  It is 
world embracing.  And it is frightening.  The forces of darkness 
align with the radicals of QenlightenmentQ and together they spread 
their blood libels.  Here are some such stops along the way. 
According to Palestinian Media Watch, 4 this week Hamas television 
-- the organization against which we fought a war and which has 
since been blooming -- aired a documentary about Jews.  In the new 
film the Jew explains that he does Qnot dip his hands in water but 
rather in the blood of young MuslimsQ....   Zahi Hawass published an 
article this week which states that the concept of murdering women, 
children and elderly flows in the blood of the Jews of Palestine. 
He writes that it was they who created a religion aimed against 
humanity in its entirety.  Is this another Taliban or Hizbullah 
operative?  Not quite.  The writer, a professor of archaeology, is 
head of the Egyptian antiquities authority, a completely public 
institution.  His statements were published in an important 
newspaper, Ash-Sharq al-Awsat, which sees print in London and is 
circulated across the Arab world.  A bit before this, in an 
interview to Egyptian television, the learned archaeologist 
explained that the QJews control the world.Q  Egypt is displeased -- 
and justly so -- over several infuriating statements issued by the 
foreign minister, Avigdor Lieberman.  It is about time that the 
Foreign Ministry summoned the Egyptian ambassador to Israel to voice 
its protest for the insolent anti-Semitism being expressed by this 
senior Egyptian official.

¶2.  Iran: 
--------- 
 
Summary: 
-------- 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized: 
QBenjamin Netanyahu needs to convince Obama that doing anything 
short of stopping the mullahs would be dangerously reckless. 
 
Intelligence affairs writer Ronen Bergman opined in the 
mass-circulation pluralist Yediot Aharonot: QThe Iranians are 
accelerating [their nuclear program].  Israel lacks accurate 
information.

¶I.  "Obama Abroad" 
 
The conservative, independent Jerusalem Post editorialized 
(4/10):QOn the issues that most concern Israelis, paramount among 
them Tehran's nuclear ambitions, Obama reiterated that he had Qmade 
it clear to the people and leadersQ of Iran Qthat the United States 
seeks engagement based upon mutual interests and mutual respect. 
Now, Iran's leaders must choose whether they will try to build a 
weapon or build a better future for their peopleQ.... Obama has been 
convinced -- partly by venerable cold warriors such as Sam Nunn and 
Henry Kissinger -- that it might be easier to garner international 
support for stopping pariah states from going nuclear if the U.S. 
shows a willingness to sharply reduce its own atomic arsenal.... 
What this means for Israel in pursuit of its highest national 
interest, blocking Iran from fielding a nuclear bomb, is that 
Benjamin Netanyahu needs to convince Obama that doing anything short 
of stopping the mullahs would be dangerously reckless. 
 
II.  "The Iranians Are Stepping Up Their Efforts" 
 
Intelligence affairs writer Ronen Bergman opined in the 
mass-circulation pluralist Yediot Aharonot (4/10):QIn the final 
analysis, the Iranians are accelerating [their nuclear program]. 
Israel lacks accurate information.  Most involved people in the 
country believe that Israel does not have a military option since it 
would have to go to war without the United States and that it should 
not act on its own even if Obama authorizes it.  A majority of 
Israeli experts says that an attack today, would delay the [Iranian] 
project by two to three years.  The repercussions on the history of 
the Middle East would be unbearable for Israel.
