SUMMARY 
------- 
 
¶1.   (SBU) Immediately following the April 7 with Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs Chief of Staff Khemiri (Ref A), the 
Ambassador briefed a group of European diplomats on the ACST 
tax crisis.  The Europeans were universally supportive, with 
EU ambassadors agreeing to make an informal demarche as soon 
as possible and some ambassadors offering more concrete 
steps.  The group also suggested that next week's visit of 
the Czech president may provide an opportunity to raise the 
school issue at the highest possible level.  End summary. 
 
------------------- 
EUROPEAN SOLIDARITY 
------------------- 
 
¶2.  (SBU) The Ambassador briefed the ambassadors or other 
representatives of the Belgian, Dutch, German, Italian, 
Polish, Romanian, Spanish and Swiss Embassies and the 
European Commission on the ACST tax crisis on the evening of 
April 7 at the German ambassador's residence.  Some of the 
European diplomats present have their own children in the 
school, and all have children from their missions and/or 
larger communities in the school.  The assembled group 
expressed unanimous support for the school and agreed that 
the issue is fundamentally political, not technical as the 
Tunisians allege. 
 
----------------------- 
EU ACTION & OPPORTUNITY 
----------------------- 
 
¶3.  (SBU) Urged on by the Dutch ambassador, the EU diplomats 
agreed to approach the Czech ambassador (not present) in his 
role representing the Presidency to request an immediate 
informal EU demarche on the subject.  All agreed that only 
intervention at the level of the Tunisian president is likely 
to cause the GOT to alter its course.  The Polish ambassador 
suggested, and the group enthusiastically endorsed, that the 
visit to Tunisia next week of Czech President Vaclav Klaus 
may prove to be an excellent opportunity to take the issue 
directly to President Ben Ali.  (Note:  Post has asked 
NEA/MAG to repeat the ACST demarche cable to Prague.  ACST 
counts over 125 EU nationals among its students including the 
dependents of a dozen EU missions and institutions, although 
no Czech nationals.  End note.) 
 
------------------------ 
FURTHER EUROPEAN ACTIONS 
------------------------ 
 
¶4.  (SBU) Some Europeans agreed to go further either at that 
meeting or in conversations later that evening.  The German 
ambassador said he would also put in a request to meet with 
Minister of State Ben Dhia on the ACST issue and encouraged 
others to do the same.  The Swiss ambassador offered his very 
strong support to whatever course of action would be helpful. 
 The Romanian ambassador offered to have his President raise 
the issue when Ben Ali visits in May, but acknowledged that 
this would likely be too late. 
 
--------------------------- 
ACST PREPARES STAFF/PARENTS 
--------------------------- 
 
¶4. (SBU) As rumors continue to fly about the school's 
uncertain future, the ACST Director in consultation with the 
Board and Embassy, made on April 8 two brief statements to 
the community.  To the staff, he acknowledged that the school 
faces a very serious problem and assured employees that his 
team, the Board and the Embassy are working hard to find a 
solution, but declined to provide more details and asked for 
patience in light of the sensitivity of the issues involved. 
To the parents he said much the same thing in a brief entry 
in the weekly newsletter, also announcing that the issue will 
be discussed at the school's upcoming and sure to be 
well-attended Annual General Meeting on the evening of April 
¶17.
