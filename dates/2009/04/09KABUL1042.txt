After beginning the week with a chaotic debate and vote of 
confidence in favor of Information Minister Abdul Karim 
Khoram in the Lower House (ref A), both houses of Parliament 
ended the week with sessions that failed to gain a quorum. 
Among the issues raised in plenary or committee sessions this 
week were: 
 
- ISAF Deputy Commander Lt. Gen. Dutton briefed the Lower 
House Defense Committee on April 23 on its investigations of 
civilian casualty incidents.  MPs expressed gratitude for the 
briefing, which they said was the first ISAF effort to engage 
Parliament, but hoped it was only the beginning of a longer 
discussion on how to improve coordination between ISAF and 
Afghan security forces, and limit civilian casualty incidents. 
 
- MPs from Khost continued their walkout over a civilian 
casualty incident in that province more than a week ago (ref 
B).  One MP said the walkout would continue until MPs saw 
progress in the government's effort to limit such incidents. 
Upper House debates this week focused mostly on the Khost and 
other civilian casualty incidents. 
 
- With no quorum present for its final session of the week, 
the Lower House deferred action on laws involving police 
reform, private security companies, and the electoral system. 
 Some MPs expressed concern that the electoral law needed to 
be passed before June in order to apply to the 2010 
parliamentary elections, and urged a quick resolution to the 
disputes holding up a vote.  MPs are divided over the issue 
of seats allocated to Kuchi nomads.  Non-Pashtun MPs 
generally want to reduce the current 10 seats in the Lower 
House, all held by Pashtun Kuchis.  Many Pashtun MPs defend 
the allocation and believe any change in the number would 
require amending the Constitution.
