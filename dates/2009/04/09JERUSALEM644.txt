Main Stories: 
------------- 
Al-Quds and Al-Hayat Al-Jadida lead with Palestinian Authority 
(PA)President Abbas' meeting with Egyptian President Mubarak in 
Cairo on April 9.  The two leaders discussed "a number of issues" 
including Palestinian unity talks that will reconvene on April 26 in 
Cairo, according to coverage.  Abbas reiterated to the press that 
the Israeli Government must commit to international agreements and 
the two-state solution, stop settlement activities and dismantle 
checkpoints if negotiations are to begin.  Abbas added that Israeli 
Foreign Minister Lieberman must also respect the Annapolis 
agreement.  Abbas confirmed that PA Premier Fayyad will resume his 
duties until Cairo unity talks produce results.  According to other 
coverage that also appears on Al-Ayyam's front page, senior Fatah 
official, Yassir Ab'd Rabbuh contradicted Abbas instating that Abbas 
has no intention of asking Premier Fayyad to form a transitional 
government.  Meanwhile, Hamas leaders in Gaza called on Abbas to 
release political prisoners from West Bank jails in support of unity 
talks. 
 
Al-Ayyam leads with and Al Quds front pages news of Jewish groups 
totaling 250 individuals, prayed on the Jerusalem Al-Aqsa mosque 
compound on April 8,9 in observance of Passover.  Palestinian 
Authority Minister of Religious Affairs Bawatna called the action a 
"provocative measure" that demands Islamic and Arab intervention. 
Reporting notes 
 
Al-Quds' front page reports on "Jerusalem Coalition in East 
Jerusalem" setting up a home demolitions protest tent in Sheikh 
Jarrah on April 9.  According to coverage also inside Al-Hayat 
Al-Jadida and Al-Ayyam, Palestinian Authority Advisor on Jerusalem 
Affairs Al Hussayni held a press conference at the tent in the 
presence of diplomatic missions explaining that Israeli measures "to 
evacuate" the city's Arab residents are based on a policy to change 
the demographics of the city and prevent the establishment of a 
Palestinian state.  Al-Quds' front page also reports on 15 new 
demolition orders for East Jerusalem homes "lacking building 
permits."  In separate front page reporting, Al Quds and Al-Hayat 
Al-Jadida note April 9 remarks by British Foreign Minister Miliband 
from his visit to Jordan, expressing concern over home demolitions. 
Miliband insisted that Jerusalem must be a shared capital, stressed 
British support for the Road Map and an end to settlement activities 
and called on improving humanitarian conditions in Gaza. 
 
Al-Quds cites DPA reporting on Iranian President Mahmud 
Ahmadinejad's reaction to U.S. diplomatic engagement, expressing 
Iranian "openness" to talks based on "mutual respect and fair 
relations."  Reporting also notes Department of State confirmation 
that the U.S. will pursue talks with Iran and Ahmadinejad's 
announcement of a new uranium facility. 
 
All-dailies front page news on Sinn Fein Gerry Adams' meeting with 
Hamas leader Haniyyah on April 9 in Gaza.  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida notes 
that Adams relayed to Secretary Clinton and Envoy Mitchell that 
Hamas must play a central role in bringing stability to the region. 
According to all coverage, Haniyyah stressed that the situation in 
Gaza is "extremely difficult" because of continued Israeli attacks 
and the "siege."  Haniyyah also called on the world to end the 
people of Gaza's suffering.  For his part, Adams reassured Haniyyah 
that the Irish people fully support Palestinians and the 
establishment of a Palestinian State.

All dailies led with news of Israeli settlers attacking Palestinians 
in the West Bank village of Safa, "under the full protection of 
Israeli soldiers."  The ensuing clashes between settlers and 
Palestinians resulted in the injury of 40 Palestinians and burning 
of Palestinian houses and cars, according to coverage.  Papers noted 
that the settler attack came in reaction to the April 3 attack by a 
Palestinian from Safa on two settler youth in Bat Ayin settlement 
near Bethlehem.  Al-Hayat Al-Jadida and Al-Ayyam ran lead photos of 
f 
settlers throwing stones at Palestinians and Israeli soldiers 
opening fire on Safa residents.

BLOCK QUOTES:-------------- 
 
 
 
 
1) Rimonda Tawil opines in Al-Quds independent daily under the 
title, "Obama is an unusual President" (04/10):  "Obama represents a 
new era that will witness major change in the world... this man can 
do a lot, not only for the U.S., but for all nations, as is obvious 
in his statements regarding the Middle East... Obama is an usual 
president, and his era is not a usual one.  There is real change in 
U.S. policies, slow perhaps, but real.  Therefore, we as 
Palestinians and Arabs must make good use of this era and not leave 
the scene empty while Israeli lobby groups in the U.S. impose their 
agenda on the new administration.  We need to impose our agenda onto 
the agendas that have been imposed for ages by Jewish lobbies in the 
U.S." 
 
2) Regular columnist Samih Shabayb opines in Al-Ayyam daily 
independent under the title, "The dangers of settlers" (04/10): 
"These days, [Israeli] settlers are moving around freely attacking 
Palestinians with the full protection of the [Israeli] 
Government,... It is unlikely that this Government will ever take 
the necessary steps to stop settlers from attacking Palestinians nor 
respond to the demands and calls of the international community to 
stop the attacks... therefore, Palestinians should call for 
international protection from these attacks which are likely to 
increase under the Netanyahu Government... This is a legitimate 
demand that will place responsibility back on Israel for the... 
bloody attacks between Palestinians and settlers..."
