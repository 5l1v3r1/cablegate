SUBJECT: NICARAGUA: AMCIT PROPERTY CLAIMS MONTHLY UPDATE: MARCH 2009
 
SUMMARY 
------- 

¶1. In March 2009, the Government of Nicaragua (GON) reported the 
resolution of seven Embassy registered property claims, including 
one claim previously dismissed under Decree 38 (1979).  One claimant 
recovered her property through the courts and one claimant signed a 
leasing agreement with the Nicaraguan National Police to recover his 
property.  We have added a new category to track the resolution of 
U.S. claims recently dismissed by the GON.  There remain 606 
unresolved registered property claims belonging to 287 U.S. citizens 
in the Embassy's database.  To date, the overwhelming majority of 
resolutions have involved compensation via government-issued 
indemnification bonds ("bonos de pago de indemnizacion" or BPIs). 
As of March 31, 2009, the GON had issued BPIs with a face value of 
$335,698,234.17 to Embassy-registered claimants.    Since taking 
office in January 2007, the Ortega administration has resolved 67 
claims, twenty of which during the 2008-2009 waiver year.
