Poloff delivered the points in reftel to the Director of the 
Europe and Americas desk at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and 
International Relations.  Currently, the GOL has no comment 
about the Afghanistan-Pakistan strategic review.  When asked if 
there has been any reaction to Obama's speeches and other policy 
changes such as Guantanamo, she said that there has not been 
much discussion about his policies.  She did mention the 
positive feelings that the GOL has about Obama's election, but 
nothing specific to policy changes.  As with other demarches 
delivered concurrently, she mentioned that she would consult 
with her colleagues and get back to us if there is anything 
further.
