Agency (ANAC) on April 14, 2009 and delivered a diplomatic note to 
Brazil's Ministry of External Relations (MRE) on April 16, 2009 to

FAA's IASA program to take place the week of May 18, 2009.  In

Standards addressed to ANAC head Dr. Solange Paiva Vieira, who was

aviation specialist.  Both accepted the proposed timing of the IASA

letter to President Vieira.  Post provided a hardcopy of the IASA
