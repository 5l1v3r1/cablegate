REF: STATE 36629 
 
Â¶1. (SBU) Charge d'Affaires delivered the diplomatic note 
contained in reftel to Vice Foreign Minister Faisal Miqdad on 
April 15.  Miqdad harkened back to his tenure at the Syrian 
Mission to the UN in New York and recalled that Syria had 
vowed its support for the U.S. candidacy to the now-defunct 
UN Commission on Human Rights.  After the vote, Miqdad, said, 
he had been asked if Syria had indeed supported the 
ultimately unsuccessful U.S. candidacy; he recalled his 
reply:  "When Syria gives its word it keeps it."  Obviously 
intrigued by the news the U.S. was seeking a seat on the 
Human Rights Council, Miqdad told the Charge that the Syrian 
government would "seriously look into the issue with great 
interest."
