¶1.  (U) Summary:  A recent validation study conducted by the 
Guangzhou Fraud Prevention Unit (FPU) with the assistance of the 
Office of Fraud Prevention Programs revealed that post's American 
Chamber of Commerce of South China (AmCham) referral program 
continues to function almost flawlessly.  As the Consulate's most 
visible example of our commitment to facilitate legitimate business 
travel, the AmCham referral program provides not only convenience to 
travelers and companies, but also ease of adjudication for consular 
officers.  Between July 1, 2007 and June 30, 2008 post issued 2,886 
AmCham referrals; post confirmed that 2,882 have returned to China 
after their business trips. Post confirmed that 99.86% of VRP 
applicants returned to China after completion of their business 
trips to the United States.  Trends in business travel related to 
the economic downturn in southern China will be reported separately. 
End summary. 
 
¶2.  (U) Background: Since first established in 1997, Guangzhou's 
AmCham referral program has been extremely beneficial to both Post 
and the local American business community.  AmCham has more than 
1,650 members, including many who participate in the Visa Referral 
Program (VRP). To qualify for AmCham membership a company must be 
principally owned by a U.S. citizen and have an office in China.  At 
the time of adjudication VRP applicants present an invitation 
letter, an invitation letter, and their rsum. AmCham applicants 
are allotted twenty interviews slots each afternoon, in addition to 
drop-box service available for those who have traveled to the U.S. 
within the past year. 
 
¶3.  (U) AmCham deals directly with the company sponsoring the trip, 
not with the applicants.   AmCham handles all cases submitted 
through the VRP. After ensuring that all documents are in order, the 
applications are transferred by courier to the NIV section.  Post 
then adjudicates AmCham referrals separately each afternoon. In 
order for companies to maintain membership in the referral program, 
AmCham requires the company to submit a copy of the return page of 
the applicant's passport within one week of completion of the 
business trip. 
 
¶4.  (U) In a high fraud locale like Guangzhou, adjudicating officers 
appreciate the confidence created by membership in AmCham 
employment, as well as AmCham's follow up confirmations.   AmCham 
values the expedited processing and the cachet of having a special 
channel for members to submit visa applications. Between July 1, 
2007 and June 30, 2008, post received 2,902 referrals through 
AmCham; post approved 99.48% of the VRP program's applicants. 
 
¶5.  (U) Methodology:  FPU used the Ad Hoc Report Tool (ART) to pull 
records of all VRP issuances and refusals from July 1, 2007, until 
June 30, 2008.  Post then requested assistance from FPP to check 
ADIS records for entry, exit, and change of status for each 
applicant. ADIS records are sometimes incomplete, for example, 
airline employees that buy planes in the United States and then fly 
them back to China may not be recorded as departing the United 
States.  Thirty-seven travelers did not show a record of departure. 
FPU made cold calls to verify their whereabouts. 
 
¶6.  (U) Results:  Post confirmed that 99.86% of VRP applicants 
returned to China after completing their business trips to the 
United States.  Only four remain inconclusive because of a lack of 
current contact information.  Post is working with AmCham to locate 
these applicants. 
 
¶7.  (U) Conclusion:  The AmCham referral program continues to be an 
extremely effective tool in Post's outreach to the local American 
business community. The extremely high rates of both approvals and 
returns demonstrate the successful partnership post has developed 
with AmCham through this program. In the future Post will continue 
to work closely with AmCham to improve and enhance the program.
