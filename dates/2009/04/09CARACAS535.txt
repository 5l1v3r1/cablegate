SUBJECT: VENEZUELA CLAIMS PREPAREDNESS ON SWINE FLU 
 
¶1. (SBU) SUMMARY:  Venezuela's Health Ministry reported there 
are no actual or suspected cases of swine flu in Venezuela, 
and that local health authorities stand ready to screen 
incoming travelers from the United States and Mexico.  No 
actions have been taken to restrict agricultural products 
from any country, although one Venezuelan state bordering 
Colombia has initiated a "health alert" and will monitor 
shipments across the frontier.  Embassy sources agree that in 
spite of public statements to the contrary, the Venezuelan 
government is not prepared to deal with a domestic outbreak. 
END SUMMARY. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The afternoon of April 27, Minister of Health Jesus 
Mantilla claimed Venezuela has no actual or suspected cases 
of human swine flu.  The government of the Bolivarian 
Republic of Venezuela (GBRV) has formed a "National Response 
and Preparedness Committee" consisting of the Ministries of 
Health, Agriculture and Lands, and the Office of the Vice 
President, to monitor the situation.  Mantilla expressed 
confidence that if an outbreak were to occur, Venezuelan 
authorities would be capable of addressing it and would keep 
the public fully abreast of the situation.  Former Minister 
of Health Jose Felix Oletta told the press, however, that 
Venezuela is not prepared to face any serious, domestic 
outbreak of human swine flu. 
 
¶3. (SBU) According to Mantilla, flights arriving from Mexico 
and the United States will be monitored for passengers 
exhibiting symptoms of swine flu, but he made no mention of 
flights arriving from other countries which have reported 
cases.  After cases were reported in Colombia, the bordering 
Venezuelan state of Tachira implemented a "health alert" and 
plans to screen incoming shipments.  Mantilla also relayed 
comments from Minister of Agriculture and Lands Elias Jaua 
that Venezuela does not import pork because it is "self 
sufficient" in this product.  Nevertheless, he continued, the 
GBRV would not hesitate to implement a trade restriction on 
pork products if warranted by the circumstances.  (NOTE: 
Public statements aside, Venezuela has in fact imported pork 
from Brazil and other countries in the recent past.  END 
NOTE.) 
 
¶4. (SBU)  COMMENT:  According to Embassy contacts with local 
health officials, there is concern about the level of the 
GBRV's organizational preparedness.  Some Venezuelan towns 
are also taking the threat of an outbreak seriously.  Rather 
than relying on the central government for funds, one Mayor's 
office has already contacted the Embassy asking for donations 
for emergency equipment.  The GBRV's Animal Plant and Health 
Service is essentially inoperative due to "restructuring", 
and thus cannot be relied upon to provide timely information 
on animal disease outbreaks.  Although Venezuelan authorities 
have been relatively quick to hold press conferences on the 
issue, Embassy sources concur that it is unlikely public 
statements would be backed by coordinated action if an 
outbreak were to occur.  END COMMENT.
