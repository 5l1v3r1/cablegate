¶1. (SBU) The Ambassador delivered reftel demarche to Finance 
Minister Mohammad Chatah (Lebanon's World Bank Governor) and Central 
Bank Governor Riad Salameh (Lebanon's IMF Governor) during separate 
meetings April 8. 
 
¶2. (SBU) Chatah expressed enthusiasm for Kosovo's membership, but 
cautioned that he would have to check with the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, Prime Minister, and possibly the full cabinet before 
committing Lebanon's vote, given that his country had not yet 
recognized Kosovo's independence.  He assured the Ambassador that, 
under any circumstance, he would cast his vote in order to ensure a 
quorum. 
 
¶3. (SBU) Salameh told the Ambassador he would gladly vote for 
Kosovo's membership in the IMF, but in a follow-up conversation with 
Econ Staff, he said he was working with the Prime Minister to 
determine the government's position on the issue, and would respond 
to the Embassy with further information. 
 
¶4. (U) Post will pass any further information on the GOL position to 
Washington contacts mentioned in reftel.  Post POC is EconOff Amy 
Tachco.
