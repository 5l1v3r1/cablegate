SUBJECT: CPC DEATH THREATS TO HUMAN & LABOR RIGHTS DEFENDER

¶1. (C) SUMMARY: On March 26, Human Rights Defender and Labor 
Activist Alvaro Leiva Sanchez received a hand-written death 
threat signed by the Citizen Power Council (CPC) allegedly 
from Masaya.  The note was addressed to Mr. Leiva's 
mother-in-law, but the death threat was directed against Mr. 
Leiva, his wife and two children for "continuing to attack 
the FSLN" in his lawsuit against the illegal firings of over 
10,000 Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure (MTI) 
employees by the FSLN government.  Mr. Leiva reported the 
incident to the police in Masaya where he lives, and publicly 
denounced the death threat during a special press conference 
on Tuesday, March 31 at the Permanent Commission on Human 
Rights (CPDH) in Managua.  The death threat shows once again 
that Nicaraguan human rights defenders continue to be targets 
for harassment.  END SUMMARY 
 
------------------------ 
ALVARO LEIVA SANCHEZ BIO 
------------------------ 
 
¶2. (C) Alvaro Leiva Sanchez, age 45, is a rising figure in 
Nicaragua's human and labor rights community.  While studying 
medicine in college, he was forced to flee Nicaragua in 1987 
and became a political refugee in Guatemala until 1995.  His 
experience as a political refugee led him to change careers 
to law in order to defend human rights.  When he returned to 
Nicaragua, Mr. Leiva found work in the Ministry of 
Transportation and Infrastructure (MTI) and became involved 
in the employee union.  He rose through the union leadership 
ranks and eventually became the General Secretary of the 
Public Employees Union of the Ministry of Transportation and 
Infrastructure (SEMTIAC).  After the Sandinista National 
Liberation Front (FSLN) returned to power in 2007, Mr. Leiva 
defended thousands of MTI union employees who were illegally 
fired from their positions.  Mr. Leiva himself was fired from 
his MTI job last year.  Mr. Leiva has filed lawsuits against 
the FSLN government and MTI for the illegal firings and has 
also taken steps to file these cases with the Inter-American 
Court on Human Rights (IACHR).  He currently serves as the 
CPDH Human Rights coordinator for Masaya, Granada, and Rivas 
departments.  Mr. Leiva was mentioned in post,s 2008 Human 
Rights Report and has been nominated for an International 
Visitor Leadership Program (IVLP).

THE CPC DEATH THREAT 
-------------------- 
 
¶3. (C) A handwritten note was left at the home of Elbia 
Morales Ortega, the mother-in-law of Mr. Leiva on March 26. 
It said: "Mrs. Elbia, tell your son-in-law that he better 
shut his mouth and not continue attacking the FSLN for 
believing that he would be in the Ministry of Transportation 
forever not knowing that his days are numbered, and that his 
two daughters and wife could appear in the street or his 
house in flames or full of the worms that go in the 
canals...that we already know where he lives on lemon street 
in the Chester house... (signed) CPC."  Included with the 
note was a clipping of Mr. Leiva's recent editorial in La 
Prensa about labor laws.  After filing a police report about 
the incident on March 26, Mr. Leiva contacted EmbOff on March 
30 to share a copy of the police report and death threat.  He 
held a press conference at CPDH headquarters in Managua to 
denounce the death threat on March 31.

COMMENT

¶4. (C) While this is not the first time that Nicaraguan human rights figures have been subject to death threats for attacking the FSLN government, this may be the first time that CPCs have openly signed a death threat. Previous death threats to human rights defenders were anonymous, without specific reference to CPCs. This incident shows once again that CPCs are clearly looking out for the FSLN government, and not the wider Nicaraguan society, as First Lady Rosario Murillo's propaganda would have one believe. That the incident happened at all underscores the sad fact that Nicaragua's human rights defenders continue to be targeted for speaking out against the government, the CPCs and the FSLN party.
