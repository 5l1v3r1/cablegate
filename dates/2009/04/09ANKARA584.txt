Â¶1. (SBU) We delivered reftel demarche on April 21 jointly 
with Dutch and Russian embassy representatives to MFA 
Nonproliferation and Disarmament Section Head Mustafa 
Yurdakul.  Yurkdakul noted Turkey's support for the goals and 
principles of the Global Initiative and pointed to Turkey's 
role as host of the second plenary meeting in 2007 as an 
indication of Turkey's commitment to contribute to the effort 
to prevent nuclear terrorism.  He, however, reiterated the 
GOT's disappointment that the understanding reached at the 
first GICNT plenary concerning a consensus-based approach to 
inviting new members had been breached.  As a result, 
Yurdakul explained, the GOT is no longer inclined to 
participate in the initiative at a senior level.  He said the 
MFA will ask working-level representatives from the Turkish 
embassy in The Hague to represent the GOT at the plenary.
