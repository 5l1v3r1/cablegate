SUBJECT: ENCOURAGING U.S. SHIP VISITS TO RUSSIA 
 
¶1. Resetting relations with Russia is a key foreign policy objective 
for the Obama administration.  We need to reduce levels of tension 
and mistrust, and refocus the relationship on ways to integrate 
Russia into regional and global institutions as a responsible player 
that can dramatically affect a range of issues critical to US 
national security. 
 
¶2. One potentially fruitful area of engagement is our 
military-to-military relationship. Interagency discussions are now 
considering how to move forward in light of the reduced contacts 
following the conflict in Georgia and Russian failure to follow 
through on many activities on the mil-mil work plan.  I believe we 
should look carefully at the full range of military-to-military 
engagement, with the hope that these activities could revitalize the 
relationship and reap the benefits that they have provided over the 
years. 
 
¶3. US Navy and Coast Guard port visits and joint exercises and 
operations in the Pacific have, for years, helped promote 
confidence-building, professionalization of the Russian military and 
public diplomacy.  The Coast Guard has even conducted successful 
joint operations with the Russian border guards, resulting in the 
interdiction of vessels using illegal drift nets. The US and Russia 
are neighbors in the Pacific, and robust cooperation on the high 
seas is in our mutual interest. Joint training promotes 
counter-terrorism and counter-narcotics operations as well. 
 
¶4. For several years, US ships, like the USS STETHEM last year, have 
taken part in Victory Day celebrations in Vladivostok on May 9. This 
has become a tradition that has both political and public diplomacy 
benefits, honoring our successful alliance to defeat Nazi Germany in 
World War Two in a way that still has profound popular resonance in 
Russia today. It is a natural segue to successful cooperation today 
in space, trade, and we hope a number of security areas as well, 
including Iran, North Korea, and Afghanistan. 
 
¶5. For all of these reasons, I hope that we can agree to approve a 
visit of a US Naval ship to Vladivostok for this year's Victory Day 
celebration, as well as the previously-planned July 2009 port visit, 
assuming the Russians will agree. As always, the Embassy will 
support the visit, and the Consulate will arrange community 
relations events for the sailors with local orphanages, veterans' 
homes, and local officials.  I know from previous ship visits I have 
hosted that the sailors on board are some of the finest Ambassadors 
who serve our country.   I look forward to welcoming them back to 
Vladivostok in May.
