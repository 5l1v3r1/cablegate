SUBJECT: ITALY CONSIDERING CONTRIBUTION FOR ETHIOPIAN 
UNAMID LOGISTICS UNIT 
 
REF: STATE 39748 
 
(SBU) Poloff delivered reftel points to MFA East Africa 
Office Director Giuseppe Pastorelli on April 24, requesting 
Italian support for the logistics unit pledged by Ethiopia to 
the United Nations-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID). 
Pastorelli said our approach was the first he had heard about 
the March 24 Friends of UNAMID meeting, where this issue was 
originally raised, per reftel.  He said he would query the 
Italian mission in New York for details.  Although he could 
not immediately offer a response to our request, he said 
budgetary constraints would limit Italy's ability to respond 
positively to our request.  Pastorelli thought one possible 
source for a contribution would be the Italian Africa Peace 
Facility, a mechanism created in 2007 to allow Italy to 
contribute to peace and security efforts in Africa in 
coordination with the African Union.  Post will follow up 
with Pastorelli to determine whether support is likely to be 
forthcoming.
