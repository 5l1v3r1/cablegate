SUBJECT: RECOGNITION OF EXEMPLARY PERFORMANCE ON BLUE 
LANTERN CHECKS: O'CONNOR AND KIM 
 
¶1. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize the 
outstanding performance of economic officer Matthew O'Connor 
and EXBS advisor Mi-Yong Kim for their timely and thorough 
investigation of Blue Lantern cases.  As you know, the Blue 
Lantern program is the Department's primary instrument for 
monitoring the end-use of exported defense articles, 
technology, and services.  This program is indispensable to 
PM's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls in making informed 
licensing decisions, discovering illicit supply networks, and 
deterring diversions of U.S. military articles and technology. 
 
¶2. I am particularly pleased to note that Mr. O'Connor and 
Ms. Kim are receiving this recognition for the second year in 
a row, continuing the AIT/T Blue Lantern team's long and 
proud tradition of outstanding efforts and results.  During 
the past year, despite handling 24 Blue Lantern checks, one 
of the heaviest case loads worldwide, Mr. O'Connor and Ms. 
Kim often responded to action cables within 10 days.  In 
addition to consistently producing well-documented reports of 
on-site visits and providing much appreciated interim 
updates, they effectively coordinated with their Immigrations 
and Custom Enforcement colleagues regarding a sensitive 
technology-transfer case. 
 
¶3. The PM Bureau and the Department are grateful for the 
efforts of Mr. O'Connor and Ms. Kim, which have demonstrably 
contributed to the security and integrity of U.S. defense 
trade.
