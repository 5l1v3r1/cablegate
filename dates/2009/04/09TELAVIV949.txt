¶1. (SBU) Two cases of swine flu have been confirmed by viral 
sequencing performed at Tel Hashomer Hospital as of April 28. 
Ministry of Health Officials and the director-general of the 
hospital only yesterday (ref B) characterized the first of the two 
cases as just a "slim" chance of swine flu.  First case is a 26-year 
old man who remains in isolation in Laniado Hospital in Netanya, but 
is reportedly in excellent condition and likely will be discharged 
soon.  He checked into the hospital two days after returning from a 
trip to Mexico.  He had no known exposure to pigs.  He was treated 
with a standard course of Tamiflu 75 mg twice daily.  Whether 
related to the medication or not, the patient showed rapid 
improvement in 24 hours. 
 
¶2. (SBU) The second case, a 46-year old male, checked into the Meir 
Hospital in Kfar Saba within 24 hours of arrival from Mexico.  He 
arrived with mild disease symptoms and responded quickly to Tamiflu. 
 
 
 
¶3. (U) The Israeli Ministry of Health is urging delay of all 
non-essential travel to Mexico, and in parallel with WHO action has 
upgraded the country's preparedness status from 3 to 4.  Israeli 
media reported that Prime Minister Netanyahu will be holding a 
special meeting later this evening to discuss the status of Israel's 
swine flu preparedness and is expected to task the Deputy Minister 
of Defense Matan Vilnai with ensuring Israel's readiness on the 
matter.  However, due to the quick hospitalization and isolation of 
the two men, no further infection is expected as a result of either 
of these cases.
