Â¶1.  (U) Mission delivered reftel demarche points on the U.S. 
candidacy for the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights 
to Ministry of Foreign Affairs Under Secretary, International 
Division, Marilyn Zonicle, April 1. The MFA replied that the 
GCOB had already concluded reciprocal agreements with 
Argentina, Colombia, and Mexico to fill the three available 
vacancies before the U.S. submitted its candidacy.  The GCOB 
is thus not in a position to support the U.S. candidate.
