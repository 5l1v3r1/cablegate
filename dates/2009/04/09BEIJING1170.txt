DPRK Demands Apology 
-------------------- 
 
¶2. China hopes that all parties will proceed from their "relevant 
interests" and safeguard the Six-Party Talks, MFA Spokesperson Jiang 
Yu said at the April 30 regular MFA press briefing in response to a 
question on North Korea's threat to continue nuclear and ICBM tests 
unless the UN Security Council apologizes for "infringing" on the 
country's sovereignty.  China is willing to work with other parties 
for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, she said.  Asked 
whether Japanese Prime Minister Taro Aso would raise the topic in 
his meeting with Chinese President Hu Jintao, the spokesperson said 
she could not predict their topics of discussion.  However, in Aso's 
meeting with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao April 29, both sides 
expressed willingness to increase communication and coordination for 
peace and prosperity in East Asia as well as in the world.  Asked 
whether North Korea's statement would harm Sino-DPRK friendship 
during this, the Year of China-North Korea Friendship, the 
spokesperson declined to answer as the question was hypothetical. 
 
Sino-Japanese Relations 
----------------------- 
 
¶3. Asked to characterize relations between China and Japan in the 
wake of Prime Minister Taro Aso's gift offering sent to the Yasukuni 
shrine, the spokesperson responded only that Aso is currently 
visiting China, and met today with leaders from a steel company and 
with young entrepreneurs.  Regarding historical sensitivities, China 
hopes that Japan honors its commitments and uses the past "as a 
mirror to face up to the future." China hopes Japan makes 
"unremitting" efforts in developing relations. 
 
No Tightening of Visa Policies 
------------------------------ 
 
¶4. Foreign reports that China is tightening its visa policies in 
advance of the 60th anniversary of the founding of the PRC are 
"groundless and irresponsible," the spokesperson said. 
 
Questions Not Answered: Pork, Taiwan 
------------------------------------ 
 
¶5. Asked to respond to U.S. statements that there is no scientific 
basis for the Chinese ban on pork products from Mexico and some U.S. 
states, and whether Spanish and French pork would also be banned, 
the spokesperson directed the questioner to the State Council 
Information Office, the Ministry of Health and the Administration 
for Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine.  Asked whether 
the Chinese and Taiwanese militaries may sign an agreement in the 
near future, the spokesperson directed the questioner to the 
competent authorities.
