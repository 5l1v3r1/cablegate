¶1. (U) On April 29, Police arrested 15 demonstrators at the 
Pro-Tamil Tiger rally that began on April 26 in front of the U.S. 
Consulate General.  The arrests took place during two separate 
scuffles between police and groups of young men, occurring when the 
demonstrators began to spill over police boundaries.  Newspapers 
report that the surrounding crowd of about 1,000 people began to 
chant "release the protestors" after the first group of young men 
was arrested, but remained peaceful.  In all nine people were 
charged with mischief and six with breach of peace. 
¶2. (U) On the morning of April 30, police were able to push the 
crowd, which had thinned out to approximately 40 people over night, 
off of the street and onto the sidewalk across the street from the 
U.S. Consulate.  The move opens University Avenue, a major street in 
downtown Toronto, to traffic for the first time in four days. 
Police started to wind down the rally during the evening of April 29 
by shutting down the generator powering the sound system.  However, 
even with the sound system off, drum beating continued into the 
evening. 
¶3. (U) The demonstrators, who currently number around 100 people, 
continue to call on the U.S. Government to intervene in what they 
call "genocide" being perpetrated by the government in Sri Lanka. 
They are now behind police barricades on the sidewalk across from 
the U.S. Consulate General.  Local authorities will maintain a 
significant police presence at the site, as a precaution in case the 
crowd swells after the end of the workday.  Throughout the 
demonstration, Toronto Police Services and the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police have worked closely with the U.S. Consulate's RSO and 
have been extremely helpful.
