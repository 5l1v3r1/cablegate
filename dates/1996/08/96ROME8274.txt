¶1.  ON AUGUST 14 TWO LEADING NEWSPAPERS, "REPUBBLICA" 
AND "CORRIERE DELLA SERA", REPORTED RUMORS THAT 
MUHAMMAR GADHAFI HAD SUFFERED A RECENT HEART ATTACK. 
THE PAPERS, CITING UNNAMED DIPLOMATIC SOURCES AND 
BUSINESSMEN, REPORTED THAT A LIBYAN ARMED FORCES 
ATTACK AGAINST ISLAMIC MILITANTS AND GADHAFI'S 
DISAPPEARANCE FROM THE LIBYAN PRESS HAD LED TO RUMORS 
OF HIS BEING TOO SICK TO EXERCISE HIS FUNCTIONS. 
HOWEVER, AN ANONYMOUS OFFICER OF THE LIBYAN SECRET

PUBIC APPEARANCE ON THE SEPTEMBER 1 ANNIVERSARY OF 
HIS TAKING POWER IN 1969.

GADHAFI'S HEART ATTACK OR SHED ANY FURTHER LIGHT ON 
THEM.
