SUBJECT:  JA'JA'S MOVEMENT COMMUNIQUE 
 
¶1.  ON MARCH 14, SAMIR JA'JA'S FORCES, NOW 
CALLED THE "CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT," 
ISSUED THE FOLLOWING COMMUNIQUE OUTLINING THEIR 
AIMS. 
 
¶2.  BEGIN TEXT. 
 
"THERE HAVE BEEN A LOT OF QUERIES LATELY ABOUT WHAT 
EVER HAPPENED TO THE AUTONOMOUS DECISION OF THE 
CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY, ON WHETHER THIS COMMUNITY 
HAD ACTUALLY LOST THE INITIATIVE, ON WHETHER 
SUBSISTANCE AND INSTITUTIONAL UPHEAVAL EMBODIED 
BY BASHIR GEMAYEL'S POLICY HAS BEEN OVERSTEPPED 
BY TIME AND ON WHETHER CHRISTIAN INSTITUTIONS 
FOR CONSULTATION AND DECISION HAVE BEEN CRIPPLED 
OR HAVE JUST FALLEN INTO DISUSE, THE STATEMENT 
SAID. 
 
"IN ANY CASE, WHAT IS THE ALTERNATIVE? THE STATE- 
MENT ADDED.  SOME SAY IT SHOULD BE THE POLITICAL 
COMPROMISES UNDERWAY WHILE OTHERS SPEAK, AFTER 
THE FALL OF INTERNATIONAL GUARANTEES, OF 
REGIONAL GUARANTEES INSTEAD.  WHATEVER THE 
CASE MAY BE, ALL THESE MATTERS CAN BE DISCUSSED. 
BUT WHAT IS CRYSTAL-CLEAR IS THAT THERE CAN 
BE NO SOLID POLITICAL SOLUTION UNLESS COUPLED 
WITH AN ADEQUATE BALANCE OF FORCES BEARING 
CLEAR-OUT FEATURES AND AN UNEQUIVOCAL POLITICAL 
STRATEGY TO GO ALONG WITH AN AUTONOMOUS DECISION 
FREED FROM ALL TRUSTEESHIPS. 
 
"THE RESTORATION OF THE DECISION AND THE SOCIAL 
CENTRALIZATION OF IT CAN, ALONE, PROVIDE THE 
PROPER FRAME FOR ANY SERIOUS DISCUSSION LIKELY 
TO LEAD US TO THE KIND OF PEACE ASPIRED TO, 
FOR WE REJECT THE PEACE RESULTING FROM SUBMITTING 
TO OTHER PEOPLE'S WILL. 
 
"THE CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT HAS PROVIDED THE 
ANSWER TO ALL THESE QUERIES.  THIS MOVEMENT 
ACTUALLY CONSTITUTES THE ORGANIZED EXPRESSION 
OF THE WILL OF THE BASE OF ALL CHRISTIAN IN- 
STITUTIONS IN RECUPERATING THE DECISION AND THE 
INITIATIVE, AND THERE CANNOT BE, FROM THIS DAY 
FORWARD, NO RELIANCE BUT ON THE AUTONOMOUS 
DECISION AND NO GUARANTEE BUT THROUGH POLICIES THAT 
INCARNATE THIS DECISION. 
 
"FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, THE SECURITY OF THE 
CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY WILL NOT BE DEPENDING ANYMORE 
ON THE CHANGES OF INTERNATIONAL OR REGIONAL 
POLICIES AND THERE WILL BE NO POLITICAL WILL 
LINKED TO THE MOODS AND DISPOSITIONS THAT 
GOVERN POLITICAL INTERCOURSE IN THIS TORMENTED 
COUNTRY. 
 
"FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, THERE WILL BE NO 
CHRISTIAN SOCIETY WITH A CRIPPLED WILL AND KEPT 
DEPRIVED OF POLICYMAKING AT HOME AND ON THE 
REGIONAL PLANE AS WELL, AND RULED BY VIOLENT 
WARRING STRATEGIES. 
 
"THE BASIS FOR AN OBJECTIVE COOPERATION WITH 
A REALITY OF THE KIND WE HAVE DEPICTED IS CLEAR 
AND CAN BE DEFINED, IN BRIEF, AS FOLLOWS: 
 
"EXTREMISM CANNOT BE DETERRED OTHERWISE THAN 
BY STEADFASTNESS, AND HEGEMONY AND DISCRIMINATORY 
PHENOMENA CANNOT BE HANDLED BUT THROUGH CLEAR 
POLITICAL WILLS AND IDEAS AND ADEQUATE EXECUTIVE 
INSTRUMENTS. 
 
"ONLY WHEN THE CHRISTIAN FREEDOM OF DECISION IS 
RESTORED AND THE STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES OF IT 
CLEARLY DEFINED CAN NEGOTIATION AND INTERCOURSE 
WITH ALL SIDES BECOME POSSIBLE, ON THE HOME FRONT 
AND ON THE REGIONAL LEVEL.  OTHERWISE, WE WOULD 
BE ENGAGED INTO A DANGEROUS TURNING POINT LIKELY 
TO WIPE OUT WHAT IS LEFT OF OUR ENERGIES, OUR 
CREDIBILITY AND OUR EFFICIENCY. 
 
"THE CHRISTIAN DECISION MOVEMENT CONSIDERS THAT 
THE SETTING UP OF NEW BASES FOR DEALINGS AND 
DIALOGUE HAS BECOME AN INDISPENSIBLE PRE- 
REQUISITE FOR LIBERATING THE LEBANESE INDEPENDENT 
DECISION WHICH, ALONE, IS CAPABLE OF ALLOWING 
US TO FACE SUCCESSFULLY THE SECOND DECADE OF 
OUR BITTER STRUGGLE.  TO ACHIEVE THIS, WE MUST: 
 
"FIRSTLY, RESHUFFLE THE ORGANIZATIONAL AND IN- 
 
STITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK OF THE CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY; 
 
"SECONDLY, REBUILD THE SOCIAL SECURITY OF THE 
CHRISTIANS ON NEW FOUNDATIONS BASED UPON: 
 
A)  AN INSTITUTIONAL AND CENTRAL CHRISTIAN 
INDEPENDENT DECISION; 
 
B)  A CO-ORDINATING, CONSULTATIVE AND EXECUTIVE 
FRAMEWORK GROUPING THE VARIOUS SOCIAL AND CHURCH 
LEADERSHIPS; 
 
C)  ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL STRATEGIES OF A COMPLEMENTARY 
NATURE AIMED OVERRUNNING ALL STANDING DIFFICULTIES. 
AND THE MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL THIS IS THE CORRECTION OF 
THE STRUCTURES AS TO ENSURE THEIR ECONOMIC AND 
SOCIAL EFFICIENCY; 
 
D)LEGAL INSTITUTIONS ACTUALLY PERFORMING THEIR 
NATIONAL OVERALL REPRESENTATIVE ROLE; 
 
E)  AN ETHNIC AND CULTURAL IDENTITY WITH CLEAR- 
CUT FEATURES AND CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL BALANCED 
STRATEGIES. 
 
"CHRISTIAN LEBANESE, 
 
"WE ARE A PEOPLE WHOSE ENTITY IS BASED UPON RESPECT 
AND COMMITMENT TOWARDS ALL CAUSES INVOLVING THE 
FATE OF MAN OR HIS DIGNITY AND WHEREVER MAN'S 
LIBERTIES ARE JEOPARDIZED OR UNSECURE. 
 
"THERE CAN BE NO HAZARDS IN CHRISTIANITY BUT DECISIONS 
INSPIRED BY THE HOLY GOSPEL, BY JESUS-CHRIST'S OWN 
WORDS:  SPEAK ALWAYS THE TRUTH AND BE STRAIGHT- 
FORWARD:  NO FOR NO AND YEST FOR YES".  END TEXT.
