¶1.  RESPONSES TO QUESTIONS RAISED REFTEL FOLLOW: 
 
¶A.  POST HAS NO RECORD OF ANY CHINESE GOVERNMENT 
PROSECUTIONS INVOLVING INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM DURING 
THE PAST YEAR.  ONE REPORTED SIGNIFICANT ACT OF 
BLOODSHED DURING THE PAST YEAR OCCURED IN BEIJING IN 
SEPTEMBER, WHEN A LONE CHINESE MILITARY OFFICER WENT 
ON A SHOOTING RAMPAGE, WOUNDING OR KILLING SEVERAL 
PEOPLE, INCLUDING A FOREIGN DIPLOMAT AND FAMILY 
MEMBERS.  HOWEVER, ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS PEOPLE WERE 
KILLED OR WOUNDED, THE ACT WAS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT 
CAUSED BY ONE INDIVIDUAL, AND NOT AN ACT OF 
TERRORISM.  THERE HAS NO RELATED PROSECUTION IN THE 
CASE, BECAUSE THE GUNMAN HAS KILLED IN A SHOOTOUT 
WITH POLICE. 
 
¶B.  POST HAS NO RECORD OF ANY EXTRADITIONS OR 
ATTEMPTED EXTRADITIONS OF SUSPECTED TERRORISTS BY THE 
PRC DURING THE PAST YEAR.

THE PRC, BUT IN THE PAST CHINA HAS TRANSFERRED 
CRIMINALS TO COUNTRIES WITH WHICH IT DOES NOT HAVE AN 
EXTRADITION TREATY. 
 
¶D.  RESPONSES OTHER THAN PROSECUTION:  THE CHINESE 
OFFICIAL POSITION IS THAT THE PRC GOVERNMENT IS 
OPPOSED TO ALL FORMS OF TERRORISM, AND DOES NOT 
SUPPORT OR HARBOR TERRORISTS. 
 
¶E.  WE ARE NOT AWARE OF PRC PARTICIPATION IN MAJOR 
COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORTS. 
 
¶F.  THE PRC PUBLICLY OPPOSES TERRORISM.  THE EMBASSY 
HAS NO RECORD OF PRC SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL 
TERRORISM.  THERE IS A PLO MISSION IN BEIJING. 
 
¶G.  THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHINESE STATEMENTS OF SUPPORT 
FOR A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING COUNTRY ON A TERRORISM 
ISSUE. 
 
¶H.  THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE PRC'S 
ATTITUDE TOWARD TERRORISM OVER THE COURSE OF THE PAST
