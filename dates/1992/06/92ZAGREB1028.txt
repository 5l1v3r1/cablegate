PARTIES.  THE PAKRAC COUNTY GOVERNMENT HAS RETURNED 
TO ITS SEAT AFTER A NINE MONTH EXILE.  DUBROVNIK AND 
SURROUNDING REGIONS WERE SHELLED OVER THE WEEKEND. 
SLOVENIAN RTV DIRECTOR RESIGNED AFTER COMPLAINING OF 
POLITICAL INTERFERENCE.  END SUMMARY. 
 
OSIJEK MAYOR KRAMARIC THREATENS RESIGNATION 
------------------------------------------- 
 
¶2.  THE YOUNG AND DYNAMIC MAYOR OF THE EMBATTLED 
CROATIAN TOWN OF OSIJEK, ZLATKO KRAMARIC, COMPLAINED 
TO A PRESS CONFERENCE THAT THE LOCAL MILITARY POLICE 
ARE FAILING TO CRACK DOWN ON CRIMINAL ELEMENTS WHO 
HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY INTO THE ARMY.  HE CITED A 
RECENT CAR BOMBING WHICH KILLED A YOUNG CROAT MAN AS 
THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE OF A GROWING LAWLESS TREND IN 
THE TOWN.  HE SAID THAT IF THE MILITARY POLICE WILL 
NOT PREVENT CRIMES CARRIED OUT BY ARMED RENEGADES 
DRESSED IN UNIFORMS, HE WILL BE OBLIGED TO SUBMIT HIS 
RESIGNATION.  KRAMARIC HAD ASKED SEVERAL TIMES THAT 
THE MILITARY POLICE AND MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR, SO 
FAR WITHOUT RESULT, GET RID OF THOSE CRIMINALS WHO 
ARE BURNING HOUSES, SHOPS, AND CARS.  ACCORDING TO 
THE MAYOR, THE ARMED FORCES DID NOT DO ENOUGH TO 
PREVENT THE RECRUITMENT OF PEOPLE WITH AN UNSAVORY 
BACKGROUND, AND THESE PERSONS NOW TAKE ADVANTAGE OF 
THEIR UNIFORMS AND WEAPONS TO CARRY OUT CRIMINAL 
ACTS.

THE CROATIAN ARMY WHO ARE CITIZENS OF B-H HAD 
RETURNED TO DEFEND THEIR HOMETOWNS.  THE MINISTRY 
INVITED INTERESTED JOURNALISTS TO INVESTIGATE THIS 
MATTER WITH THE MINISTRY'S ASSISTANCE.   LOCAL 
SOURCES CLAIM THAT SOME, BUT NOT NECESSARILY ALL, OF 
THE CONFUSION REVOLVES AROUND ARM PATCH 
IDENTIFICATIONS.  IN CROATIAN, THE MILITARY PATCHES 
CARRY AN "HV" FOR "HRVATSKA VOJSKA" (CROATIAN ARMY).

SOME B-H UNITS COMPOSED OF CROATIAN NATIONALITY 
DEFENDERS CARRY ARMS PATCHES "HVO," WHICH IS 
"HRVATSKO VIJECE OBRANE" (CROATIAN DEFENSE COUNCIL). 
SIGHTINGS OF THESE PATCHES ON THE B-H FRONT, OR 
PERHAPS EVEN ON DEMOBILIZED FORMER-HV BOSNIAN 
SOLDIERS WHO KEPT THEIR ORIGINAL "HV" PATCHES FOR 
PERSONAL REASONS, GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT CROATIAN 
ARMY UNITS ARE PRESENT IN STRENGTH IN 
BOSNIA-HERCEGOVNIA.

GROUPS IN THE COUNTRY.  HE LAMENTED THE RECENT ARMED 
CLASH BEWTEEN THE "HVO" (CROATIAN DEFENSE COUNCIL) 
UNITS AND THE "TO" (B-H TERRITORIAL DEFENSE) UNITS 
WHICH RESULTED IN TEN INJURED.  MESIC ALSO STOPPED IN
