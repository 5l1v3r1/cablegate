¶1.  THE PKK ATTEMPTED YESTERDAY TO EXPAND ITS TERROR 
CAMPAIGN TO MALATYA. 
 
¶2.  TURKISH DAILY NEWSPAPERS REPORT THAT A SINGLE 
TERRORIST, APPARENTLY INTENT ON STAGING A ONE-MAN 
SUICIDE ATTACK ON SECURITY HEADQUARTERS, WAS FOILED 
BEFORE HE COULD CARRY OUT HIS ATTACK WHEN HE DROPPED A 
MAGAZINE FROM HIS KALASHNIKOV ON THE STREET.  HAVING 
LOST THE ELEMENT OF SURPRISE, HE RETREATED TO THE 6TH 
FLOOR OF THE RAILWAY WORKERS' UNION BUILDING ACROSS THE 
STREET FROM THE SECURITY OFFICE, AND OPENED FIRE AT THE 
SECURITY BUILDING. 
 
¶3.  DURING THE STANDOFF, WHICH LASTED FOUR HOURS, A 
BUILDING GUARD WAS KILLED, AND A POLICEMAN AND A 
PASSER-BY WERE WOUNDED.  THE SIEGE ENDED WITH THE POLICE 
KILLING THE TERRORIST, WHO WAS FOUND TO HAVE HAD A 
KALASHNIKOV RIFLE, TWO PISTOLS, 150 ROUNDS OF 
AMMUNITION, AND GRENADES WITH HIM. 
 
¶4.  MALATYA SECURITY OFFICIALS TOLD CONSULATE THAT THE 
TERRORIST HAS NOT YET BEEN IDENTIFIED, BUT APPARENTLY 
WAS OPERATING ALONE.  NEVERTHELESS, SEVERAL OTHER 
SUSPECTS HAVE BEEN ARRESTED AS POSSIBLE 
CO-CONSPIRATORS. 
 
¶5.  COMMENT:  MALATYA, WHICH IS RELATIVELY PROSPEROUS 
COMPARED TO OTHER AREAS OF THE SOUTHEAST, HAS FOR SOME 
TIME BEEN OUTSIDE THE AREA OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY.  THIS 
IS THE FIRST MAJOR OPERATION DIRECTED AGAINST MALATYA IN 
OVER A YEAR.  END COMMENT.
