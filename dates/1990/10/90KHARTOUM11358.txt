SUBJECT:  SUDAN:  1990 ANNUAL TERRORISM REPORT 
 
REF:  A) STATE 355397, B) KHARTOUM 7788, C) KHARTOUM 11253 
 
¶1.  THE 1990 TERRORISM REPORT FOR SUDAN IS AS FOLLOWS. 
 
¶2.  THE ACROPOLE TERRORIST BOMBING CASE WENT THROUGH A 
SERIES OF POSTPONEMENTS, WITH THE NEXT HEARING NOW 
SCHEDULED FOR JAN. 22, 1991 (REF C).  MANY OF THE 
POSTPONEMENTS, INCLUDING THE MOST RECENT ONE, INVOLVED 
CONSULATIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE VICTIMS' 
FAMILIES.  THE FAMILIES SUBMITTED STATEMENTS DURING THE 
YEAR INDICATING WHETHER THEY WOULD PARDON THE TERRORISTS, 
WITH OR WITHOUT COMPENSATION ("DIYYA"), AS WELL AS THE 
AMOUNT OF DIYYA DEMANDED.  THE COURT ANNOUNCED IN 1989 
THAT IF ANY FAMILY REFUSED TO PARDON THE TERRORISTS, THEY 
WOULD BE EXECUTED.  SOME COMMENTS BY LEGAL AUTHORITIES IN 
1990 SUGGESTED THAT LONG-TERM IMPRISONMENT OF THE 
TERRORISTS MIGHT BE POSSIBLE, ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT 
INCLUDED IN THE CHOICES MADE AVAILABLE TO THE FAMILIES. 
 
¶3.  THE GOVERNMENT UNDERTOOK NO MAJOR COUNTERTERRORISM 
EFFORTS IN 1990. 
 
¶4.  THE PLO CAMP NEAR SUDAN'S RED SEA COAST, OCCUPIED 
SINCE THE EVACUATION OF BEIRUT IN 1982, WAS REPORTEDLY 
EVACUATED IN 1990 (REF B).  NO OTHER TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO HAVE CAMPS IN SUDAN. 
SUDAN EXTENDS DIPLOMATIC RECOGNITION TO THE PLO, WHICH 
MAINTAINS AN EMBASSY IN KHARTOUM.  PLO CHIEF YASSER 
ARAFAT VISITED SUDAN SEVERAL TIMES IN 1990. 
 
¶5.  THE GOVERNMENT MADE NO PUBLIC STATEMENTS IN 1990 IN 
SUPPORT OF A TERRORIST-SUPPORTING GOVERNMENT ON A 
TERRORISM ISSUE. 
 
¶6.  ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT IS NOT A SPONSOR OF TERRORIST 
ORGANIZATIONS, IT HAS A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH IRAQ AND 
INCREASING CONNECTIONS WITH IRAN.  IN 1990 THE GOVERNMENT 
SIGNED AN "INTEGRATION AGREEMENT" WITH LIBYA.  AS A 
RESULT OF THE AGREEMENT, COL. MUAMMAR QADHAFI VISITED 
KHARTOUM IN OCTOBER.  THIS AGREEMENT PERMITS MUCH EASIER 
ACCESS TO SUDAN BY LIBYANS.  SUDANESE AND NORTH KOREAN 
OFFICIALS EXCHANGED VISITS DURING THE YEAR.  THE OUTBREAK 
OF THE PERSIAN GULF CRISIS IN AUGUST PRODUCED MORE 
INTENSIVE PAN-ARAB AND PAM ISLAMIC COMMENTARY IN THE 
GOVERNMENT-CONTROLLED MEDIA, CREATING A MORE RECEPTIVE 
CLIMATE FOR ANTI-WESTERN ACTIONS IN SUDAN.
